Howard was the first overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic, with whom he played for the first eight years of his career.. Howard entered the NBA as the National High School Player of the Year and co-MVP of the McDonald\u2019s All-America Game. He has become one of the top players in the NBA, earning six All-Star selections and three Defensive Player of the Year awards.\nPrep Career\n\nHoward played high school basketball at Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy. He led his team to the state championship his senior season in 2004 after losing in the championship game the previous year.\n\nHoward, motivated by the dream of one day playing in the NBA, modeled his game after Kevin Garnett because of Garnett\u2019s ball-handling skills and abilities. Although Michael Jordan was his favorite player growing up, Howard knew that he was built more like Garnett, and that he should learn the game based on Garnett\u2019s approach. He was also intrigued by the idea that Garnett went directly from high school to the NBA and considered his options as a senior. The NBA scouts were awaiting his decision, as most of them felt that he was ready to play immediately.\n\nBy Howard\u2019s junior year at Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, he had grown to 6-10 and was dominating opposing defenses. He posted a monster year, averaging 20.0 points per game, 15.5 rebounds per game and 4.5 blocks per game and leading his team to a berth in the state championship game. He followed that up with one of the most prolific years ever in Georgia for a high school basketball player. Howard averaged 25.0 points per game, 18.0 rebounds per game, 3.5 assists per game, and 8 blocks per game on the way to leading his team to the Class A state championship.\n\nHoward ended his career at Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy with numerous awards to his credit. He was named Georgia\u2019s Mr. Basketball during the 2004 season after he dominated on the court. In addition, he was named as the winner of the 2004 Naismith Award, the Gatorade National Player of the Year and the McDonald\u2019s National High School Player of the Year. All three awards labeled Howard as the best high school player in the country. If that wasn\u2019t enough, he also was named co-MVP of the 2004 McDonald\u2019s High School All-America game and later appeared in the Parade magazine All-America team.\n\nHoward would leave his mark on Georgia basketball, as he had one of the most prolific careers of anyone ever to play in the state. He ended his career with 2,146 points, 1,728 rebounds and 811 blocked shots in 129 games, an average of 16.6 points per game, 13.4 rebounds per game, and 6.3 blocks per game.\nProfessional Career\nLos Angeles Lakers (2012-)\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, Howard reiterated his desire to be traded before the start of the 2012-13 season, with Brooklyn as his preferred destination. The Nets and Magic were unable to come to terms on a trade, leading Orlando to seek out other trade partners. On August 9, 2012, the team agreed to terms on a trade that sent Howard, Chris Duhon and Earl Clark to the Los Angeles Lakers, Andrew Bynum and Jason Richardson to the Philadelphia 76ers, Andre Iguodala to the Denver Nuggets and Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, Josh McRoberts, Christian Eyenga, Maurice Harkless and Nikola Vucevic to Orlando. The trade was finalized the following day.\nOrlando Magic (2004-2012)\n\nDwight Howard was selected first overall in the 2004 NBA draft at the age of 18. He averaged 12.0 points per game, 10 rebounds per game, and 1.7 blocks per game as a rookie with a playing time of a little over 32 minutes per game. He became only the eighth player in the history of the NBA to average a double-double in his rookie season.\n\nHoward was becoming a dominant rebounder in only his first year in the league. He pulled down more than 10 rebounds 43 times and more than 20 rebounds three times. His scoring wasn\u2019t far behind as he was learning the offensive part of the game. He scored more than 20 points 11 times in that rookie season, with a high of 29 points against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nSince his rookie season, Howard\u2019s numbers have skyrocketed in almost every category. By his second year in the league, his rebounds were up by 2.5 per game and his points were up by 3.8 per game. By his third year in the NBA, Howard\u2019s points had gone up almost another two points per game while he averaged almost two blocks per game. He would make his first NBA All-Star team his third year in the league in 2006-07. He followed that up with two consecutive NBA All-Star appearances in 2007-08 and 2008-09.\n\nComing into his fourth year in the league (2007-08), Dwight Howard was clearly one of the best centers\/power forwards in the NBA. He would make the All-NBA first team averaging more than 20 points per game, more than 14 rebounds per game, and nearly 3 blocks per game. In addition, his defense was steadily improving as he was named to the All-NBA defensive second team.\n\nHoward would do one better during the 2008-09 season, as he was named the Defensive Player of the Year and All-NBA defensive first team. He again made the All-NBA first team and was establishing himself as the one of the greats of the game. He also scored a career-high 45 points against the Charlotte Bobcats in February 2009.\n\nDuring the 2009 playoffs, Howard became just the fifth player in NBA history to record 20 double-doubles in a single postseason, leading the Magic to their second appearance in the NBA Finals, where they fell to the Lakers in five games. Howard was also selected to be the cover athlete of EA Sports \u201cNBA Live 10\u2033 video game.\n\nIn 2009-10, Howard earned another starting appearance at the All-Star Game, leading the Magic to the top of the Southeast Division, despite roster changes that saw Hedo Turkoglu leave via free agency and Vince Carter brought in via a trade. The Magic won their first eight games of the postseason, sweeping the Bobcats and the Hawks. However, in a rematch with the Boston Celtics \u2014 who they\u2019d defeated in the 2009 playoffs \u2014 Orlando fell in six games.\n\nHoward\u2019s offensive game continued to improve in 2010-11, as he averaged a career-best 22.9 points per game. He also earned his third consecutive Defensive Player of the Year award, becoming the first player in league history to pull off that feat. Orlando shook up its roster in the regular season, re-aqcuiring Turkoglu and sending Carter to Phoenix, while also shipping Rashard Lewis to Washington in exchange for Gilbert Arenas. Howard remained a mainstay in the linup, leading the Magic to 52 wins. However, they were knocked out of the playoffs in the first round by the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nThe subsequent lockout-shortened season was one of turmoil for Howard and the Magic. Rumors swirled that Howard wanted to be traded, and would not sign a contract extension to stay in Orlando. Howard started the season on the Magic roster, and became the franchise\u2019s all-time leading scorer on Jan. 24, 2012. He made his sixth consecutive All-Star team and was a first-team All-NBA selection for the fifth time.\n\nAs the 2012 trade deadline approached, rumors once again kicked up that Howard wanted to be traded, and was pushing Orlando to trade him to New Jersey to be united with Deron Williams. However, on the day of the deadline itself, Howard had a change of heart and signed paperwork waiving the early termination option on his contract, keeping him under contract in Orlando through the 2012-13 season. Howard\u2019s season ended on a sour note, as he was forced to undergo back surgery on April 19, ending his season prematurely. The Magic were knocked out of the playoffs in the first round for the second consecutive season.\nDunk Contest\n\nHoward entered the 2008 Slam Dunk Contest during All-Star weekend with the idea of taking home the title, after having been eliminated in the first round the year before. As unconventional as the contest has become over the years, Howard pulled out a bag of tricks that not only got the crowd excited but also showed off his array of aerial abilities.\n\nHoward perfected several dunks that had never before been seen in the contest. On his second dunk of the first round, while standing outside the 3-point line, he tossed the ball at the rim, ran up, jumped, tapped the ball against the backboard with his left hand, caught it with his right, and slammed it.\n\nFor his first dunk of the finals, Howard used the help of a smaller basket that was placed on the backboard next to the regulation rim. It carried the basketball that he was to dunk. Howard ran up, jumped, grabbed the ball in midair off the small rim, and windmill-slammed it into the regulation rim.\n\nFor his final dunk, Howard pulled out a Superman cape and placed it around his neck, while taking off his jersey to reveal the superman shirt underneath. This got the crowd\u2019s attention, and they stood up in anticipation of what came next. As the ball was thrown over the backboard by another player, Howard ran up from outside the 3-point line to just inside the foul line, jumped, caught the ball with both hands, and threw it in with his cape flying behind him. The dunk would win Howard the 2008 Slam Dunk Contest with 78 percent of the fan vote.\n\nHoward would enter the 2009 Slam Dunk Contest as well, only this time he had 5-foot-9-inch Nate Robinson to contend with. As promised, before one of his dunks, Howard disappeared into a phone booth to change into his Superman outfit. When he came back out, there was a second basketball goal placed next to the regulation one. It was raised to 12 feet. Howard slammed the ball with ease, sending the crowd into a frenzy. Unfortunately for Howard, Nate Robinson would win the competition by actually jumping over Howard himself in the final round.\nUSA Basketball\n\nDwight Howard was named to the 2008 USA Olympic basketball team that competed in Beijing and was the youngest member of the squad at only 22. Howard had been passed up for the 2004 Olympics in favor of Emeka Okafor, who was the No. 2 overall pick behind Howard in the 2004 NBA draft.\n\nHoward would play well during the Beijing Olympics, as he was counted on heavily \u2014 he and Chris Bosh were the only true big men on the roster. In the gold medal game against Spain, Howard scored 8 points and grabbed 5 rebounds in helping Team USA to win the gold medal.\n\nHoward missed the 2012 London Olympics after undergoing back surgery earlier in the offseason.","birthday":"12\/08\/1985","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":9608,"username":"DwightHoward","website":"www.dwighthoward.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"74504778787","name":"Dwight Howard","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DwightHoward","likes":3782372,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151681315383788","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1044691_10151681315383788_209525225_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Official Page of the 2006, 2009 and 2010 NBA Slam Dunk Champion. WORDAAPP! http:\/\/StateofNate.com","bio":"Nate Robinson is a 7th year NBA star originally from Seattle, WA, known for his explosive scoring and leaping ability. Nate has served as a successful combo guard for the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Oklahoma City Thunder and Golden State Warriors. Nate is the NBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first three-time slam dunk champion.\nNBA: Nate was chosen with the 21st pick in the 2005 NBA Draft by the Phoenix Suns and traded to the New York Knicks. Nate averaged 9.3 points, 2.0 assists, 2.3 rebounds and 22 minutes during his rookie campaign. He recorded a career-high 34 points vs. the Sixers on March 31, 2006, marking the highest-scoring game for a Knicks rookie in 20 years. Nate is the first three-time Slam Dunk champion in the NBA. He electrified a worldwide audience by winning the 2006 Slam Dunk Contest. His signature dunk came in the second round, when he leapt over the 1986 Slam Dunk winner, Spud Webb for a one-handed slam off a Webb bounce pass. Nate completed the 2006-07 season averaging 10.1 points, 1.4 assists, 2.4 rebounds and 21 minutes per game.

{"about":"Thanks for being a fan on facebook! You can also check me out at my website, http:\/\/abbywambach.com and on twitter \u0040AbbyWambach.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"Abby Wambach has been known to describe herself as a \u201cgoofball,\u201d but she leaves that laid-back side of her personality on the sidelines come game time. In six years, she has established herself as the most formidable offensive player on the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team, dominant in the air and all but unstoppable on the ground.\n\nAbby has attracted attention on the soccer field since early childhood. Growing up in Rochester, NY, she played in her first youth league at age four, and was transferred from the girls\u2019 to the boys\u2019 team after scoring 27 goals in three games. The youngest of seven children, Abby felt right at home with the boys\u2019 team, since she spent her childhood roughhousing with her four older brothers.\n\nAfter playing soccer and basketball in high school, Abby focused on soccer at the University of Florida. She was named All-SEC for four straight seasons, conference Player of the Year twice, and a First-Team NSCAA All-American, in addition to leading the Gators to the NCAA Final Four in her senior season. She set school career records for goals (96), assists (49), points (241), game-winning goals (24), and hat tricks (10).\n\nAlso in 2001, she caught the eye of U-21 National Team coach Jerry Smith (husband of her former WNT teammate, Brandi Chastain), who convinced her that, with a lot of hard work, she could earn a spot on the senior national team. She began training with a new sense of purpose, and made her WNT debut at that year\u2019s Nike U.S. Women\u2019s Cup.\n\nIn 2002, she was the second player taken in the WUSA draft and became Mia Hamm\u2019s teammate on the Washington Freedom. With Mia as mentor, Abby polished her physical skills and sharpened her ability to read the game. Just as importantly, she learned how to stay focused on the game while being targeted by opponents for whom the only way to stop her was to knock her down, as well as to constantly strive to improve.\n\nBy 2003, Abby and Mia were the WUSA\u2019s most lethal scoring tandem, combining for 66 points as the Freedom stormed to the league title. National Team coach April Heinrichs was quick to take advantage of the pair\u2019s chemistry. Abby started nine of her 14 WNT games that year, including all five Women\u2019s World Cup matches in which she helped the U.S. to a third place finish. After the World Cup, Abby was named U.S. Soccer\u2019s Female Athlete of the Year for 2003. The award capped a stellar year that also included a WUSA Founder\u2019s Cup Championship with the Washington Freedom, a WUSA scoring championship (shared with Freedom and WNT teammate Mia Hamm), and MVP honors in the Founder\u2019s Cup final.\n\nIn 2004, Wambach had one of the most prolific seasons in U.S. Women\u2019s National Team history. At the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, Abby started all five matches that she played, scoring four goals with one assist. The U.S. defeated Brazil 2-1 on Abby\u2019s header in extra time to win the gold medal. During 2004, Abby scored 31 goals in 30 matches, making her only the fourth U.S. player to record double figures in goals and assists in a calendar year. Her 75 points on the year mark the second highest point total in U.S. history, surpassed only by Michelle Akers in 1991. For her efforts, Abby was named the 2004 U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year for the second year in a row and finished fourth in the voting for the 2004 FIFA Women\u2019s World Player of the Year.\n\nAbby started all eight games in which she played in 2005, tallying four goals and five assists. In 2006, she led the U.S. in scoring with 17 goals and 8 assists. Abby recorded her 50th career goal in only her 64th cap, making her the second-fastest player in U.S. history to reach 50 goals. At the CONCACAF Qualifying Tournament, she scored both goals in the U.S. team\u2019s 2-0 win over Mexico, qualifying the U.S. for the 2007 Women\u2019s World Cup. Once again, Abby capped off another impressive year by finishing fourth in the voting for FIFA Women\u2019s World Player of the Year.\n\nIn 2007, Abby moved into fifth place on the all-time U.S. goal scorer list. Heading into the World Cup, Abby led the U.S. in scoring with 11 goals and 3 assists. In the 2007 World Cup, she scored 6 goals in six matches, despite receiving 11 stitches to her head after colliding with a North Korean player in the first game of the tournament. In the quarterfinal match against England, Abby reached the 100 cap milestone. The U.S. finished third in the 2007 World Cup.\n\nThe 2008 season began with much promise for Abby. In 22 games, she notched 13 goals and 10 assists, good for 36 points. In addition, Abby scored her 99th career goal and seemed poised to reach 100 career goals at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. However, in the U.S. team\u2019s final match before the Olympics, Abby collided with a Brazilian player, fracturing her tibia and fibula. Unfortunately, this injury knocked Abby out of the Olympics. With her 99 career goals in only 127 caps, Abby now stands one goal shy of becoming the fifth U.S. player and ninth female player in world history to notch 100 career international goals.\n\nCurrently recovering from her injury, Abby was assigned back to the Washington Freedom in the Women\u2019s Professional Soccer (WPS) allocation draft. She looks forward to returning to the field to rejoin the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team as well as to begin her time with the Washington Freedom.\n\nWhen not playing soccer, Abby unwinds by playing video games, listening to music and reading. She likes mountain biking and camping, and would someday like to hike the Appalachian Trail.","talking_about_count":294,"username":"abbywambach","were_here_count":0,"id":"75223102189","name":"Abby Wambach","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/abbywambach","likes":321175,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151141355872190","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/560993_10151141355872190_1717465422_n.jpg","offset_y":32,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The official WWE Universe fan page for The Undertaker on Facebook.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"For more than two decades, The Deadman has loomed over the WWE landscape like a menacing shadow, spelling out doom for those who dare cross him. Imbued with seemingly mystical abilities and preternatural in-ring ability, The Undertaker is a WWE great in a class by himself, and no list of legends would be complete without him.\n\nFirst introduced at 1990\u2019s Survivor Series, The Phenom debuted as the final member of Ted DiBiase\u2019s \u201cMillion Dollar Team.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before he began to battle with Hulk Hogan, then at the top of the food chain in WWE. This clash set the tone for Undertaker\u2019s dominant career. No one was too big and no one was safe from his gloved grip.\n\nA multiple WWE and World Heavyweight Champion, a six-time tag team titleholder and a Royal Rumble winner in 2007, Undertaker\u2019s accomplishments in WWE have cemented his place among the greatest in the game. But it is one achievement that stands out above all others; one that is likely never to be topped. Since Tombstoning \u201cSuperfly\u201d Jimmy Snuka at WrestleMania VII in 1991, Undertaker has enjoyed a winning streak at The Show of Shows that stands at an astounding 21-0. Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Jake \u201cThe Snake\u201d Roberts, Randy Orton, Kevin Nash and many more have fallen at The Deadman\u2019s hand, leaving the WWE Universe to believe that this record will perhaps never be blemished for the rest of time.\n\nAfter appearing at a WWE Live Event, the WWE Universe was abuzz, wondering if The Phenom would compete at WrestleMania 29. At \u201cOld School\u201d Raw, The Undertaker ended all speculation, appearing at the beginning of the show intent on extending his unprecedented streak. CM Punk earned the opportunity to face The Deadman on The Grandest Stage of Them All and the rivalry quickly escalated when Punk interrupted The Undertaker\u2019s tribute to the late Paul Bearer. The Second City Saint stole Bearer\u2019s trademark urn in the ultimate display of disrespect and continued to taunt and infuriate The Undertaker with the vessel, carelessly juggling it as if it were a toy.\n\nIn a final attempt to mentally disassemble The Phenom, Paul Heyman dressed as Paul Bearer \u2014 allowing CM Punk to strike. The Straight Edge Superstar mercilessly attacked The Deadman using the urn before emptying its contents all over The Undertaker. At WrestleMania, the two rivals finally met in a physically intense matchup that saw Punk kick out of a devastating Tombstone before The Deadman buried his opponent to remain undefeated on The Grandest Stage of Them All.\n\nThe night after WrestleMania 29, The Phenom prepared to address the WWE Universe when The Shield surrounded the legendary Superstar. However, the treacherous trio retreated when Kane and Daniel Bryan came to The Deadman's aid. The Phenom joined forces with Team Hell No and battled The Shield on Raw from London but Reigns, Ambrose and Rollins emerged victorious. On SmackDown, The Deadman battled Dean Ambrose in his first SmackDown match in three  years. The Phenom was successful, but was brutally assaulted by The Shield after the contest.\n\nA true, in-ring pioneer, The Undertaker has also been part of many WWE firsts, including the inaugural Hell in a Cell Match in October 1997, the first-ever Casket Match at Survivor Series 1992 and the first-ever Buried Alive match in 1996.\n\nIn the face of all challenges, The Phenom has risen stronger and mightier than ever, serving as sports-entertainment\u2019s grim reaper of justice \u2014 his name permanently etched like an epitaph on the history books of WWE. It seems that no grave can hold him; no god will claim him and no devil will have him. In the end, there can only be one suitable resting place for the almighty Deadman: the WWE Hall of Fame.

{"about":"The official WWE Facebook fan page for CM Punk.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"It\u2019s not surprising that CM Punk cites the radical \u201cRowdy\u201d Roddy Piper as a childhood influence. After all, Punk is the embodiment of the anti-establishment, whose skill at igniting verbal \u201cpipe bombs\u201d is rivaled only by \u201cHot Rod\u201d himself.\n\nPunk even looks the part of rebel with his too-numerous-to-count tattoos and body piercings. Yet, he waxes way more philosophical than his exterior might suggest, and has shown a diverse set of interests that include ghost hunting, G.I. Joe and the \u201cStraight Edge\u201d movement, a subculture that rejects the use of drugs, alcohol and a dependency lifestyle.\n\nHis in-ring repertoire is an assimilation of fighting styles, all of which were put on full display during his debut in The Land of the Extreme in 2006. Since then, Punk has added many accomplishments to his considerable r\u00e9sum\u00e9, including the ECW, WWE, World Heavyweight, World Tag Team and Intercontinental Championships.\n\nToday, Punk is headlining pay-per-views \u2014 and he\u2019s doing so in spite of the events of 2011, when he assailed Mr. McMahon with his blunt opinions about the business and made a bold promise not to renew his contract with the company. Punk\u2019s criticism struck a nerve with The Chairman who, against his better judgment, granted The Second City Saint a WWE Championship Match at WWE Money in the Bank in the Superstar\u2019s native city, Chicago. Punk not only beat John Cena to win that match, but he also absconded with the WWE Championship as the seconds on his WWE contract ticked down.\n\nFortunately for WWE fans everywhere, Punk agreed to re-sign with WWE weeks later, compelled to return to the ring to prove that he\u2019s the undisputed \u201cBest in the World.\u201d The Voice of the Voiceless advocated on behalf of disenchanted WWE fans who felt the WWE product was in need of a good (roundhouse) kick in the teeth. He became two-time WWE Champion, proving his mettle by defeating the likes of Chris Jericho, Alberto Del Rio, Daniel Bryan and other elite Superstars.\n\nAs Punk\u2019s WWE Title reign continued to climb, so did his contempt for the WWE Universe and the Superstars in the locker room who failed to show him the proper level of \u201crespect.\u201d Proclaiming himself a \u201cPaul Heyman guy,\u201d Punk aligned with the founder of the original ECW and one of his early mentors as his WWE Title reign grew to become the longest of the modern era. Despite his impressive accomplishments since winning his second WWE Title at Survivor Series 2011, Punk remains unsatisfied, lashing out at the WWE Universe for favoring Superstars like Cena and Ryback, both of whom unsuccessfully vied for Punk\u2019s WWE Championship as 2012 drew to a close.\n\nUltimately, Punk\u2019s 434-day WWE Title reign would come to an end at the hands of one of the most celebrated Superstars of all time, The Rock, at Royal Rumble. There, in front of a sold-out crowd in Phoenix\u2019s US Airways Arena, The Great One drove the People\u2019s Elbow into Punk\u2019s heart and scored both the pinfall and the WWE Championship. In a rematch at Elimination Chamber, despite attempting every trick in the book, Punk was once again pinned by The Brahma Bull.\n\nHis lengthy reign concluded, Punk next set his sights on The Undertaker\u2019s WrestleMania winning streak, taking possession of The Deadman\u2019s mysterious urn to get inside the head of his Show of Shows opponent. After a hellacious matchup that saw The Second City Savior deliver an astounding elbow from the top rope to the announce table, The Deadman buried his opponent to remain undefeated on The Grandest Stage of Them All. One night after failing to topple The Streak, a preoccupied Punk walked out on a live Raw broadcast \u2014 a rare moment of speechlessness for the silver-tongued Superstar. He has not been seen in WWE since.\n\nRegardless of what ultimately lies ahead, Punk ranks himself high among WWE\u2019s most iconic Superstars. And despite his recent losses, it remains nearly impossible to disagree with him.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"CM Punk stats\nHeight: 6 foot 1\nWeight: 222 pounds\nFrom: Chicago, Ill.\nSignature Move: G.T.S.

{"category":"Athlete","description":"Steve Roland \"Pre\" Prefontaine was an American middle and long-distance runner who competed in the 1972 Olympics. Prefontaine once held the American record in seven different distance track events from the 2,000 meters to the 10,000 meters. Prefontaine died in May 1975 at the age of 24 in a DWI auto accident.Prefontaine, Frank Shorter, and Bill Rodgers generated considerable media coverage which helped inspire the 1970s \"running boom\". Prefontaine was often known for his mustache and his long locks of hair that parted as he ran.Early lifeSteve Prefontaine was born on January 25, 1951, in the coastal logging town of Coos Bay, Oregon. His father, Raymond Prefontaine, was a carpenter and a welder after his time serving in the U.S. Army in World War II. Steve's mother, Elfriede, worked as a seamstress. The two returned to Coos Bay after Ray had met Elfriede in Germany while serving with the U.S. Army occupation forces. He had two sisters, Neta and Linda, and they all grew up in a house built by their father.Prefontaine was a rambunctious person, even during his formative years. He was always moving around, partaking in different activities. In junior high, Prefontaine was on his school\u2019s football and basketball teams, but was rarely allowed to play because of his short stature. In the eighth grade, he noticed several high school cross country team members jog to practice past the football field, an activity he then viewed as mundane. Later that year, he began to realize he was able to compete well in longer distance races in his physical education class during a three week conditioning period. By the second week of the daily mile runs, Prefontaine was able to finish second in the group. With this new-found success, he fell in love with the sport.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":79,"website":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=TVNLqf5MiZUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=pre&hl=en&ei=Cu5nTbO9IJG6sAP2peCmBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false","were_here_count":0,"id":"108110099217258","name":"Steve Prefontaine","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Steve-Prefontaine\/108110099217258","likes":47115}

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Hall of Famer Edge.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"In another life, Edge could have been a rock star. From his voluminous hair to his long leather jackets and double-horns signature pose, every detail of his WWE image screamed it. Before he stepped in the ring, as the pyro blasted into the air behind him on the entranceway, he injected arenas with the energy of a packed concert \u2013 without the dangers of crowd-surfing and mosh pits. There was even a legion of groupies \u2013 Edgeheads \u2013 who tracked his every move.\n\nIt's no surprise, then, that Edge is a guitar collector and grew up listening to KISS, a band famous for their flamboyant outfits and outrageous stage antics. What is a surprise is how a shy high schooler from the little town of Orangeville, Ontario, evolved into The Rated-R Superstar.\n\nEven though he was voted \"Most Likely to Be WWE Champion\" by his classmates, Edge's path to the grand stage was anything but predetermined. The only spotlights beaming down were at the local factories where he worked odd jobs to help his single-parent mother pay the bills. Still, Edge dreamed big while idolizing larger-than-life entertainers like Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage. At age 18, Edge got the lucky break he needed in the form of an essay contest offered by a gym in Toronto. The prize? Free wrestling training \u2013 a prime opportunity for The Ultimate Opportunist.\n\nEdge had some fine company as he worked his way up the independent scene in the '90s: his childhood friend and partner for countless five-second poses, Christian. When Edge was signed to a WWE contract in 1997, it was only a matter of time before Christian would climb up the ladder too, following his best bud into uncharted territory.\n\n\"E&C\" made sweet music as a tag team, using a lot more than just Con-Chair-Tos to claim seven championships together. A Triple Threat Ladder Match victory at WrestleMania 2000 over The Hardy Boyz and The Dudley Boyz laid the foundation for a series of landmark Tables, Ladders & Chairs (TLC) contests, and some of the greatest tag team action of all time. Of course, tag teaming wasn't Edge's only specialty, as he masterfully crafted a singles career and captured a whopping 31 total titles \u2013 many of them the WWE Universe didn't even see coming.\n\nBeyond his ability to capitalize on opportunities, Edge became known as The Master Manipulator because he wasn't afraid to cross the line in order to rattle the competition. After he made history in 2006 as the first man to ever cash in the Money in the Bank briefcase, he rubbed his WWE Championship triumph in the face of all challengers with an R-rated celebration on Raw; more explicitly, a frolicking good time with Lita on a bed placed right in the middle of the squared circle.

He is usually deployed as a deep-lying playmaker or regista (a playmaker operating in a position similar to that of a defensive midfielder) for both Juventus and Italy and is regarded as a leading exponent of this position.

He is also a set-piece and penalty-kick specialist, who is known for his long distance shooting and passing. Fellow players on the Italian team gave him the nickname l'architetto (\"the architect\"), because his long passes frequently set up goal-scoring opportunities for the Italy national football team. In recent years, Juventus fans also dub him il professore (\"the professor\") and Mozart, as a fun reference to the Austrian composer's prodigious ability.Pirlo has played for the Italian youth teams U15, U18 and U21, captaining and leading the latter to victory in the 2000 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship as the Golden Player and Top Scorer of the tournament. He joined the Italian senior side during the qualification round for World Cup 2002 and captained the national team to a bronze medal in the 2004 Olympics.

{"category":"Athlete","description":"Jack Roosevelt \"Jackie\" Robinson was an American baseball player who became the first African American to play in Major League Baseball in the modern era. Robinson broke the baseball color line when the Brooklyn Dodgers started him at first base on April 15, 1947. As the first major league team to play a black man since the 1880s, the Dodgers ended racial segregation that had relegated black players to the Negro leagues for six decades. The example of Robinson's character and unquestionable talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation, which then marked many other aspects of American life, and contributed significantly to the Civil Rights Movement.In addition to his cultural impact, Robinson had an exceptional baseball career. Over ten seasons, Robinson played in six World Series and contributed to the Dodgers' 1955 World Championship. He was selected for six consecutive All-Star Games, from 1949 to 1954, was the recipient of the inaugural MLB Rookie of the Year Award in 1947, and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1949\u2014the first black player so honored. Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. In 1997, Major League Baseball \"universally\" retired his uniform number, 42, across all major league teams; he was the first pro athlete in any sport to be so honored. Initiated for the first time on April 15, 2004, Major League Baseball has adopted a new annual tradition, \"Jackie Robinson Day\", on which every player on every team wears #42.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":15,"website":"http:\/\/mlb.com\/news\/article.jsp?ymd=20080415&content_id=2529821","were_here_count":0,"id":"112595875420161","name":"Jackie Robinson","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Jackie-Robinson\/112595875420161","likes":72901}

{"about":"Welcome To The Fan page of The World's Most Destructive Batsman - Christopher Henry Gayle ! :)","affiliation":"West Indies, ICC World XI, Jamaica, Kolkata Knight Riders, Matabeleland Tuskers, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Stanford Superstars, Sydney Thunder, Western Australia, Worcestershire","bio":"A thrusting Jamaican left-hander, Gayle earned himself a black mark on his first senior tour - to England in 2000 - where the new boys were felt to be insufficiently respectful of their elders. But a lack of respect, for opposition bowlers at least, has served Gayle well since then. Tall and imposing at the crease, he loves to carve through the covers off either foot, and has the ability to decimate the figures of even the thriftiest of opening bowlers. And in this era of Twenty20 cricket, Gayle is the batsman who has thrived like no other.\n\nAmong his many strengths, perhaps the biggest one is his outstanding hand-eye coordination, which allows Gayle to regularly hit even good-length deliveries for boundaries. Technique and footwork aren't his greatest assets, but most often he compensates with other skills. No batsman has taken to the 20-over format like he has. He showed early signs of his liking for that format by smashing the first century in Twenty20 internationals - a 57-ball 117 against South Africa in the World Twenty20 in 2007 - and when Twenty20 leagues mushroomed the world over and sought international stars, Gayle was the biggest beneficiary. Over two seasons - 2011 and 2012 - of the IPL, he became easily the most feared batsman of the league, smashing three centuries leading the run charts in both seasons. And his spat with the West Indies board means he is also a Twenty20 regular in various leagues around the world, entertaining crowds in Australia, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh.\n\nGayle's free-stroking, aggressive style is obviously best suited for limited-overs cricket, but that doesn't mean he hasn't cut it as a Test batsman. When he has turned up for West Indies, his pugnacious approach has become an attacking weapon in its own right, in what's been a lean era for West Indian cricket. His 79-ball century at Cape Town in January 2004, on the back of a South African first innings of 532, was typical of his no-holds-barred approach. However, Gayle has also shown the ability to bat long periods and the hunger to make big scores. In 2009 against Australia, Gayle batted almost seven-and-a-half hours in scoring an unbeaten 165 to save the Test in Adelaide; in the very next game, though, he smashed the fifth-fastest Test century - off 70 balls - to indicate that quick-scoring remained his preferred method. Next year he batted almost ten hours and scored 333 against Sri Lanka and Muralitharan in Galle, becoming only the fourth batsman to score two triples in Tests, thus proving again his ability to bat long periods.\n\nAnd then there is also his brisk non-turning offspin, with which he has turned himself into a genuine allrounder in limited-overs cricket. His tendency to stay aloof on the field sometimes suggests he isn't interested in the proceedings, but his relaxed approached was good for the team whenever he led West Indies. However, West Indies have missed his services far too often due his differences with their board. After a long spell out from international cricket he returned strongly in 2012 on the tour of England and subsequently at home against New Zealand.","birthday":"09\/21\/1979","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Kingston","state":"","country":"Jamaica","zip":""},"personal_interests":"Playing Cricket, Dancing, Singing !","phone":"\u0040[238105089606624:CG]","talking_about_count":1145,"username":"CycloneGayle","website":"www.crichead.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"238105089606624","name":"Chris Gayle","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CycloneGayle","likes":126598,"cover":{"cover_id":481007795316351,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/1001801_481007795316351_1072120270_n.jpg","offset_y":27,"offset_x":0}}

He has been fighting at the top levels of competition and given some of the most sensational performances in the ring in recent years.\n\nA certain future Hall of Famer, Manny was voted the \"2008 Fighter of the Year\" by the Boxing Writers Association of America. He also won the BWAA award in 2006, as well as The Ring's 2006 and 2008 \"Fighter of the Year.\" \n\nManny is also recognized by most observers as the best fighter at any weight in the ring today\u2014the best \"Pound for Pound.\" \n\nHe is a national hero in his native Philippines\u2014the entire country of over 96 million people comes to a virtual standstill to watch whenever he fights. \n\nManny is coming off of an electrifying second-round knockout win against former IBF jr. welterweight and WBA welterweight world champion Ricky Hatton in his last fight on May 2. \n\nThe Associated Press' Tim Dahlberg reported from ringside: \n\n\"He didn't just beat Hatton. Didn't just knock him out. \n\n\"He demolished a world class fighter who had never lost at his natural weight of 140 pounds, and he did it with such precision and ease that the talk afterward wasn't whether Pacquiao is the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world, but whether he might be one of the best ever. \n\n\"A right hook\u2014a punch most southpaws don't even have\u2014started it all, dropping Hatton midway through the first round. A left cross that may be one of the greatest single punches ever thrown in a big fight ended it with a dramatic flourish.\n\nManny is a national hero in the Philippines\u2014when he returns home after his fights, he is greeted by thousands of his cheering countrymen.\n\n\n\"When it was over, Hatton was sprawled motionless on his back in the center of the ring. Pacquiao and his corner were celebrating and the sellout crowd was trying to digest what they had just seen. \n\n\"Boxing has a new king in an unassuming fighter so good that he won his last four fights in four different weight classes.\" \n\nDan Rafael wrote on ESPN.com: \n\n\"With one thunderous left hand, Manny Pacquiao smashed his way into boxing immortality. \n\n\"Anyone doubt his pound-for-pound No. 1 perch now? Shoot, anyone doubt his place as one of boxing's best ever? \n\n\"The Filipino icon destroyed Ricky Hatton in two crushing rounds to make boxing history before 16,262 at the sold out and electric MGM Grand Garden Arena.... \n\n\"It's something those of us who saw it shouldn't soon forget because it may be a long time until we see something like this again. \n\n\"In stunningly disposing of Hatton in ruthless fashion, Pacquiao matched Oscar De La Hoya's record of winning titles in six weight divisions. But more important, by adding Hatton's lineal junior welterweight championship to his growing collection, Pacquiao added a fourth lineal title, the first fighter to do that in boxing history. (Granted, there are more divisions now than there were back in the era of fighters such as Sugar Ray Robinson.) \n\n\"In plain terms, PacMan has been 'the man' in four divisions, the clear champion in a morass of titleholders at flyweight, featherweight, junior lightweight and now junior welterweight. Toss in belts at junior featherweight and lightweight\u2014and wins against elite opponents\u2014and you have a great fighter. \n\n\"It was almost laughable how easy it was for Pacquiao, who was fighting at junior welterweight for the first time in his career after dropping down from welterweight, where he fought in December and destroyed and retired De La Hoya. \n\n\"It also happened to be Pacquiao's fourth consecutive win in a fourth different division. It seems as though there is nothing he can't do.\" \n\nIn his previous fight on December 6, 2008, Manny scored the biggest win of his career\u2014a dominant eighth-round TKO against former jr. lightweight, lightweight, super lightweight, welterweight, two-time super welterweight, and middleweight world champion Oscar De La Hoya\u2014the biggest name in the sport over the last two decades and a certain future Hall of Famer himself. \n\nAgainst De La Hoya, Manny was considered a huge underdog by most observers\u2014and the fight a mismatch\u2014because of their extreme difference in size.

Named captain of the team in 1992 (after serving as a co-captain in 1990\u201391), Sakic is regarded as one of the most able team leaders in league history and was able to motivate his team to play at a winning level.Over the course of his career, Sakic was one of the most productive forwards in the game, having twice scored 50 goals and earning at least 100 points in six different seasons. His wrist shot, considered one of the best in the NHL, was the source of much of his production as goalies around the league feared this shot. At the conclusion of the 2008\u201309 NHL season, he was the eighth all-time points leader in the NHL, as well as 14th in all-time goals and 11th in all-time assists.

He was a one-club man, having spent his entire professional career with Manchester United.\nBorn in Salford, but later moving to Langley, Scholes excelled in both cricket and football in school. He first trained with Manchester United at the age of 14 after being spotted by a scout at his school, and made his debut for United in the 1994\u201395 season. He went on to play a key part in Manchester United's Treble-winning season, winning ten Premier League and three FA Cup medals, and a second UEFA Champions League.\nScholes represented the England national team from 1997 to 2004, participating in the 1998 and 2002 World Cup, as well as UEFA Euro 2000 and UEFA Euro 2004. Scholes has amassed over 120 bookings in all competitions during his career and has been sent off ten times.\nScholes made 676 appearances for United, the 4th highest number of appearances by any player for the club. Scholes officially announced his retirement from playing duties on 31 May 2011, and is set to become a club coach from the 2011\u201312 season onwards. Former France player Zinedine Zidane described Scholes as \"undoubtedly the greatest midfielder of his generation.\"\nHere is what other Magicians think about SGOALS !\n\nPaul Scholes is the best player I've ever played with.

Even playing at Real Madrid, the players always say to me 'what's he like'? They respect him as a footballer, and to have that respect from some of those players is great.\nDavid Beckham\n\nMy toughest opponent? Scholes of Manchester United. He is the complete midfielder.\nZinedine Zidane\n\nI can't understand why Scholes has never won the player of the year award. He should have won it long ago. Maybe it's because he doesn't seek the limelight like some of the other 'stars'.\nThierry Henry\n\nThe player in the Premiership I admire most? Easy - Scholes.\nPatrick Vieira\n\nAND HERE IS WHAT SCHOLESY SAID ABOUT A QUESTION WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS IDEAL DAY !\n\nMy ideal day? Train in the morning, pick up the kids from school, go home, play with kids, have tea, get them up to bed, and then come down to watch a bit of TV. I don't get hassled. I can go anywhere I want to. Nobody stops me from going down to Tesco's. I'm recognised, of course, and I get asked for my autograph but it is never a problem. I've never been conscious of losing out on big money because of the way I've wanted to live my life. I've never turned down big commercials because I'm shy. It's just the way I've been. I did get a boot contract once. But no, I haven't earned much outside the game. Maybe it's because I'm not good looking enough?\n","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Manchester","state":"","country":"United Kingdom","zip":""},"talking_about_count":3554,"username":"paulscholesthemidfieldmaestro","were_here_count":0,"id":"170877649597281","name":"Paul Scholes - The Midfield Maestro","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/paulscholesthemidfieldmaestro","likes":98651,"cover":{"cover_id":608158255869216,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/971619_608158255869216_1778157952_n.jpg","offset_y":100,"offset_x":0}}

At 24 years-old and known for possessing one of the most electric offensive repertoires in all of MMA, Jones' athletic prowess combined with his magnetic appeal has catapulted the young prodigy toward true superstardom.\n\nA native of Rochester, New York, Jones was raised in Endicott, New York. While a senior in high school, Jones was the 2005 New York State wrestling champion, and after graduating, he entered Iowa Central Community College. There, Jones continued his dominance on the wrestling mat, becoming the National Junior College wrestling champion, and also a Greco-Roman All American. He also earned his Associate's degree.\n\nIn 2007, Jones started training in MMA. A natural at it, he made his pro debut in 2008.

However, controversy ensued as a result of the finish and Jones was disqualified, thereby being handed his first \"loss.\"\n\nDespite the defeat, Jones showed a true champion's heart by taking on a huge name in his first UFC main event, when he faced Brandon Vera.

Graziano, il mio babbo, era un pilota di moto e fin da piccolino mi ha messo in sella a qualcosa con delle ruote: la leggenda narra che ho avuto prima il motorino della bicicletta. Sembra comunque che quando avevo tre anni, Graziano avesse preparato un piccolo motorino con le rotelline, con il quale ho cominciato subito a divertirmi. Allora abitavo nella sua casa a Tavullia, vicino alla quale c\u2019\u00e8 un parcheggio asfaltato dove potevi creare una specie di pista: l\u00ec ho cominciato a girare con questo motorino rosso e le rotelline, che il Grazia poi mi ha subito tolto fin da piccolissimo. Si pu\u00f2 dire che quello sia stato il mio primo circuito, dove ho girato con tutto quello che avevo. Graziano, per\u00f2, aveva un po\u2019 paura della moto e la sua intenzione era indirizzarmi verso le quattro ruote. Anche perch\u00e9 lui, nella sua carriera, aveva fatto un sacco di incidenti, si era fatto male, tanto da essere costretto a lasciare le gare di moto per quelle di auto. \n\nQuando avevo cinque anni, il Grazia era arrivato a casa con un kart 60 cc: mi era piaciuto molto e cos\u00ec in quel periodo ho usato tanto il kart, con il quale andavamo a girare nei parcheggi della zona industriale, tra cui quello della \u201cChiusa di Ginestreto\u201d, che \u00e8 vicino alla strada che da Tavullia scende verso Pesaro. Mi ricordo che riempiva con l\u2019acqua le lattine della benzina, le metteva nel parcheggio costruendo una sorta di pista. Per\u00f2 la cosa pi\u00f9 pericolosa che facevo in quel periodo era con una macchinina a pedali, fatta come una vecchia Lotus F.1, quella colorata di verde, che il Grazia legava dietro a un motorino. Lui, naturalmente, guidava il motorino, io la macchina e con la fune mi tirava per insegnarmi a fare i traversi, che erano davvero belli dato che le gomme della \u201cLotus\u201d erano di plastica. Quando lui non c\u2019era, andavo da solo gi\u00f9 per la discesa del giardino di casa e quando ero a met\u00e0 giravo per derapare, fermandomi da una parte. Ma era una specie di roulette russa, perch\u00e9 alla fine della discesa c\u2019\u00e8 la statale\u2026Quando mia mamma ha capito cosa facevo, venne chiuso il cancello a met\u00e0 discesa: non riuscivo pi\u00f9 a prendere abbastanza velocit\u00e0 per fare le mie derapate.\n\n\nAccording to doctor Claudio Costa, when I was born, on 16 February 1979,in the sky of Urbino thunder and lightning was unleashed, anyway something extraordinary happened\u2026I don\u2019t know if this is true, what I am sure of is that my carrier started very early. Graziano, my dad, was a Motorcycle racer and from when I was very small he put me in the saddle of something with two wheels; The legend goes that I had a Motorbike before I had a pushbike. It seems anyway that Graziano had prepared a small moped with two little side wheels with which I immediately started to have fun. At the time we lived at his house at Tavullia close to which there was a tarmac parking  lot where I could create a type of race track; there I started to go round  with this little red moped  with the side wheels, that Graziano promptly removed. It can be said that this was my first circuit, where, I lapped with everything I had. Graziano, however, was a bit scared of motorbikes and his intention was to point me in the direction of cars. Also because he had many accidents in his carrier and he hurt himself so much as to be forced to leave Motorcycle racing for Car racing.\nWhen I was five years old, Graziano arrived home with a 60cc Go-Kart; I liked it a lot and I used the Go-Kart loads of times then, we would race round the parking lots of Industrial areas  one of which was \u201cChiusura di Ginestreto\u201d, which is close to the road that from Tavullia goes down to Pesaro. I remember that he used to fill up petrol cans with water and would put them down in the parking lot making a kind of circuit. But the most dangerous thing I done in that period was with a little pedal car in the shape of an old green coloured Lotus F1, that Graziano would tie with a rope to the moped. Naturally to teach me how to slide out in corners, he would ride the moped and with the rope would pull me along in the car, they were great slides as the Lotus wheels were made of plastic. When he was not around, I would go on my own down the hill in the garden at home and when I was halfway down I would turn to skid, stopping at the side. But it was a kind of Russian roulette, because at the end of the slope there was the main road. When my Mum caught on to what I was doing she had a fit and from then on closed the gate that was halfway down the slope: I was not able to get enough speed up anymore to do my skids...","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"Pilota da corsa con il numero 46.","talking_about_count":117660,"username":"ValentinoRossiVR46Official","website":"www.valentinorossi.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"535049976526453","name":"Valentino Rossi VR46 Official","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ValentinoRossiVR46Official","likes":7125656,"cover":{"cover_id":563736653657785,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/922740_563736653657785_693727282_n.jpg","offset_y":56,"offset_x":0}}

The Penn family heritage, although prominent and proud in its Hawaiian roots, is a mixture of Irish American decent (Father) and Korean \/ Native Hawaiian (mother).\n\nAt the age of 17 B.J. Penn was introduced to the world of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) by his long time friend and teacher Tom Callos. The introduction to the art of BJJ eventually brought Penn to Northern California where he trained under Ralph Gracie and rose to the rank of purple belt. With an obvious knack for the sport, Penn quickly ascended through the BJJ belt rankings. Through his tutelage at the Brazilian based Nova Uniao Jiu-Jitsu academy B.J. earned his black-belt from Andre Pederneiras in just three years of training in the Brazilian Martial Art (An honor that takes most practitioners 10 or more years).\n\nAfter placing third at the World Jiu-Jitsu Championships in 1999 in the brown belt division, B.J. returned the next year (2000) and became the first non-Brazilian in history to win first place in the black-belt division of the World Jiu-Jitsu Championship held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nAfter such a quick and amazing run in the world of BJJ, Penn was nicknamed \u201cThe Prodigy\u201d and was ushered into the sport of professional Mixed Martial Arts.  He made his professional debut with the UFC on May 24, 2001 in Atlantic City, New Jersey at \u201cUFC 31: Locked and Loaded\u201d against Joey Gilbert. It took Penn under five minutes to secure a victory over Gilbert via TKO and simultaneously launch his career into the world\u2019s fastest growing sport.\n\nPenn followed up his debut victory over Gilbert with two more first round finishes over Din Thomas and Japanese star Caol Uno. The dominance he displayed in his first three outings prompted the UFC to put him up against a man who had already competed in 14 contests. At \u201cUFC 35: Throwdown\u201d Penn squared off with Jens Pulver for the UFC\u2019s first ever lightweight title. After 25 minutes of action (5 rounds) Penn failed to capture the title and was also handed his first professional loss in the process.\n\nPenn returned still hungry for the belt and was able to notch two consecutive victories after the Pulver loss to earn another shot at the vacant lightweight title. At \u201cUFC 41: Onslaught\u201d B.J. faced off with one of his former opponents, Caol Uno. His history with Uno, however, did not repeat itself, and Penn was again unable to obtain the UFC championship belt due to a judges majority draw ruling over the title fight.\n\nPenn then left the promotion for a one fight stint and took on Pride lightweight champion Takanori Gomi at Rumble on the Rock 4 in Honolulu, Hawaii. He was able to finish Gomi, the then ranked number one lightweight in the world, via rear naked choke midway through the third round. This fight remains one of the most anticipated and impactful lightweight fights in modern Mixed Martial Arts.\n\nOn January 31, 2004 Penn returned to the Mixed Martial Arts Promotion that got him started (UFC) to face a man who at the time was on a thirteen fight winning streak and seemed near invincible after six successful title defenses inside the UFC octagon. It was this fight against Matt Hughes at \u201cUFC 46: Supernatural\u201d that Penn made his third attempt at earning a UFC title, this time, in the UFC\u2019s welterweight division. It took Penn just four minutes and thirty-nine seconds to best the champ and end the fight after a dominating opening and a quick rear naked choke to secure the UFC\u2019s welterweight title.\n\nAfter winning the UFC\u2019s welterweight crown from one of the most dominant champs in the sports history, Penn once again left the promotion to pursue further challenges across the globe. It was during this time that the natural lightweight bounced from welterweight to heavyweight and faced notables such as Duane Ludwig, Rodrigo Gracie, Renzo Gracie and Lyoto Machida.\n\nB.J.\u2019s already storied career, after five years in the making, found him back in the UFC after his time overseas. After two unsuccessful outings in the UFC\u2019s welterweight division against George St. Pierre and Matt Hughes, respectively, Penn returned to his divisional home of lightweight in June of 2007. At \u201cUFC 80: Rapid Fire\u201d Penn defeated Joe Stevenson to finally earn the 155 pound title that had eluded him twice prior. B.J. then successfully defended his title three times before an eventual decision loss to Frankie Edgar at \u201cUFC 112: Invincible\u201d on April 10, 2010.\n\nSince losing his lightweight title B.J. Penn has returned to the UFC\u2019s welterweight division where he successfully finished a trilogy fight at \u201cUFC 123: Rampage vs. Machida\u201d with Matt Hughes. Penn scored a Knockout victory over Hughes in just twenty-one seconds of the very first round to claim the trilogy between the two legends, 2-1.  He then followed up that victory with a number one contender bout against Jon Fitch at \u201cUFC 127: Penn vs. Fitch\u201d on February 27, 2011, which ended in a majority draw. And that fight brings us to date\u2026\n\nWhile the career of B.J. Penn has thus far spanned the course of 10 years, his win\/loss record only gives a minor glimpse of what the man has accomplished. B.J. has fought in eleven UFC title fights, is one of only two men in UFC history to win two titles in two different weight classes, and is the first fighter in UFC history to test himself in four different divisions.  At \u201cUFC 94: St-Pierre vs. Penn 2\u201d, B.J. became the first and, to date, only UFC Champion to challenge another UFC Champion for a chance at holding two belts simultaneously in two different divisions. B.J. is also the only man in UFC history to face seven different UFC Champions.  In 2009 B.J. was the UFC\u2019s top pay-per-view draw and earned a gross revenue of $79.6 million U.S. dollars for the promotion. He was recognized by Hawaii\u2019s \u201cStar Bulletin\u201d as the #4 most significant Hawaii sports figure of the decade in 2009 and during the same year was honored with a \u201cBJ PENN DAY\u201d by Big Island Mayor, Billy Kenoi.\n\nOutside of his career and history with Martial Arts B.J. Penn has appeared in film, on radio and has a New York Times Best Selling Autobiography entitled, Why I Fight: The Belt is Just an Accessory. He has also co-authored one of the most sought after Martial Arts instructional books, which is titled, Mixed Martial Arts: The Book of Knowledge and owns a gym called \u201cPenn Training and Fitness\u201d in his hometown of Hilo, Hawaii. With a clothing line, a host of endorsement deals and other family run businesses Penn is not only a fighter, but a business savvy entrepreneur as well.\n\nIn the community BJ Penn gives back via his PENN HAWAII YOUTH FOUNDATION which has helped hundreds of at risk kids in the Hilo community by teaching them his core values, martial arts and being a positive role model in the community at his Penn Training and Fitness Center in Hilo. He also works very closely with the Hawaiian organizations across the State such as the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, Kau Inoa and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands for grants for his youth foundation.\n\nB.J. Penn became a father on October 25, 2008, when his daughter and love of his life, Aeva Lili\u2019u Penn was born. More than any Martial Arts Championship, business venture, endorsement deal or public recognition, Penn has found the most happiness in fatherhood and remains dedicated to having an important role in the life of his daughter.\n\nWhile the past is written in stone, the future for \u201cThe Prodigy\u201d is yet to be determined. And while we cannot predict what\u2019s next, one thing will hold true: B.J. Penn will always go out and \u201cJust Scrap\u201d for all his fans around the world for years to come.\n","birthday":"12\/13\/1978","category":"Athlete","category_list":[{"id":"186982054657561","name":"Sports & Recreation"}],"checkins":2,"is_published":true,"location":{"street":"145 Keawe St.","city":"Hilo","state":"HI","country":"United States","zip":"96720","latitude":19.725176,"longitude":-155.087296},"personal_info":"\"OFFICIAL\" BJ PENN FAN PAGE\nGoogle+ Personal: http:\/\/tiny.cc\/z1e75\nGoogle+ Fan Page: http:\/\/tiny.cc\/afkvj \nTwitter: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/bjpenndotcom (\u0040bjpenndotcom)","personal_interests":"Ultimate Fighting Championship UFC\nSurfing, hanging with friends and ohana ","talking_about_count":47920,"username":"bjpenn","website":"http:\/\/www.BJPenn.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"39228950838","name":"BJ PENN","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bjpenn","likes":792200,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152127034285839","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/553926_10152127034285839_223208616_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Vaughn is known best by his aggressive, foot to the floor, big smoke driving style. Being such a fierce competitor, Vaughn is known as the only American to win a D1 Grand Prix event, not once - but twice. In 2005 Vaughn stunned the world when he won the D1GP USA vs. Japan. In 2007, he brought America the gold once more by winning the D1GP World Championship.\nIn 2010, Vaughn earned his first Formula Drift Championship, becoming the second-ever Champion with a strictly-drifting background. In 2011, Vaughn competed in China's premier drift series, WDS, and took home the Championship. In 2012, Vaughn was shy just one spot of the Championship, taking second place overall. He has achieved five wins and multiple podiums throughout his Formula Drift career. \n\nIn 2011, Vaughn had a Formula Drift season of ups and downs, but finished off the year with one podium. Vaughn traveled to China throughout the year to compete in WDS (World Drift Series) and came out on top with the Championship. Vaughn also had the opportunity to travel to Saudi Arabia, to share drifting with the Middle East. That is where he created his video \u201cDrifting in the K.S.A\u201d which became quite a hit. In 2011, Ford launched their \u201cOctane Academy\u201d and Vaughn would be one of the featured drivers, along side Ken Block, Brian Deegan, and Tanner Foust. \n\nFor the 2010 season, Vaughn made the switch over to a 2011 Monster Energy Falken Tire Ford Mustang. When the season ended, Vaughn had podiumed an incredible 6 out of 7 Formula Drift events. Vaughn\u2019s consistency and incredible season earned him his first Formula Drift Championship, a goal Vaughn has chased after for the previous seven years. In 2010, Vaughn also continued to travel the world performing drifting exhibitions at huge events to do his part to spread word about the motorsport phenomenon of drifting and the incredible Ford Mustang to the masses.  \n\nAlso in 2010, Vaughn launched his brand for a new generation of Mustang with the RTR. The Mustang RTR is Vaughn\u2019s vision his has dreamt for years that has finally come to reality. It is a dealer-installed package for the 2011 Ford Mustang GT V8 available at select Ford dealerships. For more info on the Mustang RTR, please visit MustangRTR.com. \n\nVaughn became the new face of the Ford Mustang in 2009, as he introduced the 2010 version to the world by drifting it onstage during its live reveal on Speed TV. He also had the amazing opportunity to tour Japan with a 2010 Mustang while stopping to drift at legendary tracks. Competition-wise in the 2009 season, Vaughn retired his 2005 Ford Mustang for the new 2010 version, a car that gave him much success. After an incredible year, Vaughn came close to the Championship with a 5th place finish. \n \nVaughn began his career as a professional driver in 2004 when he drove his personal Nissan S13 in Formula Drift. In 2005, he switched machines to a new Ford Mustang, which has brought him many victories. In 2008, Vaughn got the attention of Ford Racing who decided to back this American Mustang driver.\n \nBlame it on the go-carts he toyed with when he was only four years old, or maybe the dirt bikes he raced for most of his young adult life; there is no question that Vaughn has always had a passion for motorsports. He's come a long way from those early days of drifting, but Vaughn Gittin Jr. still feels the same rush of adrenaline as he did then - the same sense of adventure and challenge every time he enters a turn and throws his Mustang sideways.\n","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"2010 Formula Drift Champion \n\nwww.VaughnGittin.com","personal_interests":"Name\u2013 Vaughn Gittin Jr.\nAge \u2013 32\nHeight \u2013 6\u2019 2\u201d\nWeight \u2013 215\nNickname \u2013 JR\nCar Number \u2013 1\nYears drifting \u2013 11\nYears Pro \u2013 10\nHometown \u2013 Baltimore, Maryland\nCar: 2013 Monster Energy Nitto Tire Ford Mustang \nEngine: Ford Racing \/ Roush Yates built 6.7L V8\nFiltration: K&N Air, Oil & Breather Filters\nClutch: Exedy Twin Plate\nHp\/Torque: 845 horsepower \/ 623 ft.lbs torque\nTeam:  Monster Energy Nitto Tire Drift Team \nCrew: Ian Stewart, Dean Steele\nSponsors:  Monster Energy, Nitto Tire, Ford, K&N, Bosch, Ford Racing, HPI Racing, Exedy, Alpinestars, Electric Visual, HRE Wheels, Wilwood, Tein, ASD Motorsports, Drift Alliance, RTR\nPersonal Cars \u2013 2013 5.0 Ford Mustang RTR, 2011 5.0 Ford Mustang RTR, 2010 Ford Mustang RTR-C, 1969 Ford Mustang RTR-X, 2012 Ford F450, 2004 Ford F150\n\nWebsite \u2013 VaughnGittin.com, MustangRTR.com\nYouTube \u2013 Youtube.com\/vgittin \nFacebook - Facebook.com\/OfficialVaughnGittinJr\nTwitter - Twitter.com\/VaughnGittinJr \n\n","talking_about_count":12512,"username":"officialvaughngittinjr","website":"http:\/\/www.VaughnGittin.com, http:\/\/statigr.am\/vaughngittinjr, https:\/\/twitter.com\/vaughngittinjr","were_here_count":0,"id":"173966519241","name":"Vaughn Gittin Jr.","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/officialvaughngittinjr","likes":181256,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152004083754242","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1470117_10152004083754242_1592724718_n.jpg","offset_y":68,"offset_x":0}}

Amar'e is not only a Pro Basketball Player and NBA All-Star, but an Actor, Author, Producer, Motivational Speaker & Philanthropist. \n\nStanding at 6'10\", Amar'e strives to positively influence youth, through his Each 1 Teach 1 Foundation, providing philanthropic support to at-risk minority youth and families.  He was encouraged to give back so ardently, due to his tumultuous childhood in Florida, having moved around often and attending six different high schools before finishing his prep career at Cypress Creek High in Orlando, Florida.  His first foray with organized basketball was at the late age of 14, but he quickly developed the skills to now make him one of the best players in the NBA.  His brute force and amazing quickness for someone his size makes him extremely difficult to defend in the low post and a shot-blocking threat on the defensive end.\n\nAmar'e owns Stoudemire's Downtown, a classy, sports-oriented restaurant next to the Phoenix Suns' arena, which has become a mainstay in the city.  His love of music spurred him to start his own record label, Hypocalypto Records.\nThe Phoenix Suns' Captain was recently the only athlete in the UNICEF global campaign for child survival awareness called \"Believe in Zero.\"  The goal of this campaign is to  ask the general public to join UNICEF in the fight to roll back the number of preventable child deaths from 25,000 per day to zero.  He has written several opinion editorial articles, such as for Ebony Magazine and the AZ Republic, encouraging the youth to keep on track with their studies, as well as encouraging adults to give back to the youth.  \n\nHe also lent his voice to the \"Boost\" High School Dropout Prevention campaign to help curb the nation's alarming dropout problem. Amar'e donated his time to record a series of entertaining and motivating wake-up calls and alarm ringtones that encourage teens throughout the country to \"wake up\" and get to school.  \n\nAmar'e has been featured in a myriad of media outlets, such as Nickelodeon Jr., Spike TV, Men\u2019s Health, Maxim, Men's Journal, Money Magazine, Sports Illustrated, SI for Kids, Mass Appeal, and Ebony to the Jimmy Kimmel Show, Best Damn Sports Show, Jim Rome Show, and ESPN.\n","personal_interests":"Basketball, Music, Travel, Film, Reading & Philanthropy","talking_about_count":6399,"username":"amarestoudemire","website":"www.amarestoudemire.com www.twitter.com\/amareisreal www.myspace.com\/amareisreal www.youtube.com\/StatTV ","were_here_count":0,"id":"14676868295","name":"Amar'e Stoudemire","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/amarestoudemire","likes":848952,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151539689528296","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/156305_10151539689528296_1484562621_n.jpg?lvh=1","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"category":"Athlete","description":"Brett Lee is a former Australian cricketer and a Channel Nine cricket commentator. During his international career, Lee was recognised as one of the fastest bowlers in the world of cricket. In each of his first two years, he averaged less than 20 with the ball, but since then has mostly achieved figures in the early 30s. He was also known as an athletic fielder and useful lower-order batsman, with a batting average exceeding 20 in Test cricket.On 13 July 2012, Lee announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket. Having declined to renew his contract with his home state side New South Wales, he continues to play T20 cricket in the IPL and Big Bash League.For the 6th season of Indian Premier League he will do double duty for Kolkata Knight Riders, taking on the role of bowling mentor in addition to his playing role.StyleLee is known for his pace and regularly clocks 150\u00a0km\/h and above. He ranks only behind Pakistani bowler Shoaib Akhtar (161.3\u00a0km\/h, 100.2\u00a0mph) as the fastest bowler in contemporary cricket during most of the 2000s. The strain of consistently bowling at 150\u00a0km\/h caused a string of stress fractures and recurring injuries and forced him to alter his strategy, which he has done effectively. Rather than relying on pace alone, he uses a wide array of deliveries aimed at wearing down the batsman, although he has been known to bowl entire overs above the 150\u00a0km\/h mark. His fastest ball was clocked at 160.8 km\/h (99.9 mph) against New Zealand in 2005. In a match against West Indies in 2000\/01 he was clocked at 161.8 km\/h (100.5 mph), but it was not an official match and therefore not recognised by the ICC.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":1083,"website":"http:\/\/in.movies.yahoo.com\/news-detail\/15504\/Brett-Lee-sing-Victory.html","were_here_count":0,"id":"113676898642398","name":"Brett Lee","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Brett-Lee\/113676898642398","likes":820981}

He remains estranged from his biological father, Joseph Toney of Newark. Toney, who was once an All-State guard in high school who was offered a basketball scholarship to play at Seton Hall, struggled with drug addiction and was, by 1973, imprisoned for drug possession when O'Neal was an infant. Upon his release, Toney did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead, agreed to relinquish his parental visitation rights to O'Neal's stepfather, Phillip A. Harrison, a career Army Reserve sergeant, and his mother, Lucille (O'Neal).\n\n O'Neal and Toney have never spoken, and O'Neal has expressed no interest in establishing a relationship. On his 1994 rap album, Shaq Fu: The Return, O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song \"Biological Didn't Bother\", dismissing him with the line \"Phil is my father.\"\n\nO'Neal credits the Boys and Girls Club of America in his hometown of Newark, New Jersey, with giving him a safe place to play and keeping him off the streets. \"It gave me something to do,\" he said. \"I'd just go there to shoot. I didn't even play on a team.\" He led his Robert G. Cole High School team, from San Antonio, Texas, to a 68\u20131 record during his two years there and helped the team win the state championship during his senior year.[7] His 791 rebounds during the 1989 season remains a state record for a player in any classification.\n\nOn January 31st, 2012, O\u2019Neal was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans.[9","personal_interests":"O'Neal left LSU for the NBA after three years.

Subsequently, O'Neal earned an MBA online through the University of Phoenix in 2005. In reference to his completion of his MBA degree, he stated: \"It's just something to have on my resume for when I go back into reality. Someday I might have to put down a basketball and have a regular 9-to-5 like everybody else.\"[138]\nIn 2010 he undertook a Ed.D. in Human Resource Development at Barry University.

","affiliation":"Oklahoma City Thunder","birthday":"11\/12\/1988","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Oklahoma City","state":"OK","country":"United States","zip":""},"personal_info":"Russell Westbrook was born November 12, 1988 in Long Beach, California to parents Russell and Shannon. Soon after, his family moved to Hawthorne, California where Russell attended high school at Leuzinger High. Westbrook was a late bloomer: he entered his freshman year at 5\u20198\u2019\u2019and 140 pounds. He wasn\u2019t one of the starting five until his junior season. However, these factors didn\u2019t curb Russell\u2019s ambitions to play college ball. His desire was fueled by his father\u2019s constant attention and dedication to grooming Russell as a player. Every day, Russell Sr. would spend time with his son working on his shooting form.\n\nFinally, during his sophomore season, Russell began to grow into his oversized hands and size-14 feet. His growth spurt brought him all the way up to 6\u20193\u2019\u2019 by his senior year. That season, Westbrook really began to catch the eye of college scouts. He scored 51 points in a victory at Carson his senior year, one of eight times he exceeded 30 that season. He averaged 25.1 points and 8.7 rebounds, leading little-known Leuzinger to the Division I-AA quarterfinals. \n\nRussell signed to UCLA following his senior season and was thrust into a crowded backcourt that included established guards Afflalo, Collison and Josh Shipp. Westbrook averaged nine minutes a game during an erratic freshman season. For every highlight-reel dunk or coast-to-coast steal that brought the Pauley Pavilion crowd to its feet, there was a quick shot or ill-advised pass that sent him back to the bench.\n\nIn the off season, Russell dedicated himself to developing his game. He lifted weights and played pickup games with the NBA players who work out at UCLA during the summer. In the mornings he\u2019d run sand dunes in Manhattan Beach with his younger brother, Raynard. In the evenings, he and his father would go to a nearby park where Westbrook would shoot jumpers until darkness obscured the rim. \n\nThe extra work elevated Westbrook\u2019s game: Not only was he UCLA\u2019s fourth-leading scorer at 12.1 points per game, but he also assumed the role of defensive stopper. During his sophomore season, Russell helped lead the Bruins to the final four before losing to Memphis. Following that loss, Russell declared that he would be entering the 2008 NBA draft. \n\nRussell was a bit of an unknown during pre-draft scouting with projections of where he could be drafted spanning all over the lottery. When draft night finally arrived Russell was selected with the 4th overall pick by the Seattle Supersonics, who relocated to Oklahoma City shortly after. With a wealth of talent and a drive to be as good as he can be, Russell is set to take on the challenges of the NBA head on.","talking_about_count":113602,"username":"russellwestbrook","were_here_count":0,"id":"58643286604","name":"Russell Westbrook","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/russellwestbrook","likes":1669248,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151575974836605","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/58869_10151575974836605_1885221631_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

By the age of fifteen he was performing gym maintenance, running the front desk, and selling memberships.  When Gold\u2019s Gym was relocated to a new 65,000 sq. ft. facility, Scott was promoted to a manager\u2019s position.  At eighteen he became a personal trainer and has been training men and women from the ages of twelve to eighty-three ever since.\n\nBefore moving to Brooklyn to appear on \u201cThe Real World\u201d, Scott not only managed the fitness department and sales department for \u201cAnswer Is Fitness\u201d located in North Attleboro, MA, but he also developed and ran a highly successful DJ company called \u201cGalaxy DJ\u2019s\u201d.  In addition to this work, Scott attended and received his BA in Business from Merrimack College in North Andover, MA.  Concurrently, he acquired his real estate and financial advising licenses.\n\nScott\u2019s modeling career really started to take off his senior year of college after he entered and won the Men\u2019s Health \u201cIron Abs\u201d contest in November 2007.  He then began making a series of personal appearances and began traveling to New York City for castings and other events, and the more he became acquainted with the city, the more his interest in becoming a professional model\/actor grew.\n\nIn December 2007, Scott sent his audition tape into The Real World: Brooklyn and was selected from a pool of approximately 50,000 to 70,000 applicants.  He moved into the Real World house six months later and, now that filming is over, has decided to stay in Manhattan.  He is excited to continue taking acting classes, go on auditions, and pursue his new career.\n\nScott is also an accomplished athlete and enjoys sports such as wrestling, soccer, running cross country, boxing and kickboxing.  He spends his days going to castings, the gym, and updating his fitness website.\n","personal_interests":"My Workout Schedule (March 2012)\n\nAs of right now my workout schedule is a bit of a few training methods.\n\nI would like to continue to gain strength\/size, however with the upcoming long distance cycling, Tough Mudders, Spartan Races, etc.. I must also maintain my muscle endurance.\n\nAs a Fitness Model, I must also be able to \"lean out\" in a moments notice so my \"bulking\" phases take a bit longer than average because I keep my caloric surplus small to ensure my fat gain is minimal.\n\nAll in all, with 13 years of getting to know my body in the gym through training and eating; I have found what works for me.  What works for you may be 100\u0025 different depending on your schedule, eating habits, and genetics.  First and foremost, you should be visiting http:\/\/www.scotthermanfitness.com to find a MEAL PLAN that is right for your bodytype and goals and then start to utilize the BODY DIAGRAM to find the right routines as well.\n\nSupersetting, drop sets, burn sets, etc are all irrelevant to my training.  I will incorporate them from time to time to switch things up, but at the end of the day if I am training for a specific goal I will utilize these numbers:\n\nStrength Gain: 1-6 reps (1-1-3 Tempo)\nMuscle\/Hypertrophy Gain: 8-10 reps (2-2-4 Tempo)\nMuscle Endurance: 12-15+reps or a \"timed\" sets\n\nI used to always just follow traditional \"muscle gain\" splits (Which is totally ok to do if that is your goal!).  For example (PS- these are very generic layouts for training)\n\nChest & Triceps\nBack & Biceps, ABS\nQuads, Glutes & Calves\nHamstrings, Adductors & Abductors\nShoulders & Traps, ABS\n\nor\n\nChest & ABS (Upper & Lower)\nBack Shoulders & ABS (Obliques & Upper)\nLegs\nBiceps, Triceps, and ABS (Upper & Lower)\nABS (Lower & Obliques)\n\nor other methods like a \"Push\/Pull\" split.\n\nWhat I have found is that for my specific goals is that I will strength train in the mornings three days a week (ie HEAVY bench, squat, deadlifts, powerclean) and train for hypertrophy gains at night with a bit of cardio: say 15-20minutes max.  My nighttime training will coincide with my morning training to ensure I do not tire myself out for the next day.  For example, I will not lift back and shoulders the night before heavy deadlifting.\n\nAll in all, I produce so many different types of weight training videos\/exercises in the hopes that many of you will adapt them to YOUR specific needs keeping in mind the basic rule of:\n\nStrength Gain: 1-6 reps (1-1-3 Tempo)\nMuscle\/Hypertrophy Gain: 8-10 reps (2-2-4 Tempo)\nMuscle Endurance: 12-15+reps or a \"timed\" sets\n\nKeep in mind that my training will limit my ability to focus on one specific goal.  So although I will see improvement overall, if you goal is specifically \"Strength\", \"Muscle Gain\", or \"Muscle Endurance\" I would recommend keeping your training focused only on that goal to maximize your results :)","phone":"N\/A","talking_about_count":6960,"username":"ScottHermanFitness","website":"www.ScottHermanFitness.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"96788864561","name":"Scott Herman","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ScottHermanFitness","likes":190034,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151262608699562","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/555330_10151262608699562_254914073_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"affiliation":"UFC Light Heavyweight Fighter","awards":"Former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion\nNY Times Bestselling Author","bio":"Born July 1, 1979 in Columbus, Ohio, Forrest Griffin relocated to Athens, Georgia, to attend University of Georgia, receiving a degree in Political Science. To pay the bills, he worked as a police officer for the local law enforcement. Forrest began his mixed martial arts (MMA) training on his days off at the Hard Core Gym under Adam and Rory Singer. He trained here 5 years, where he developed his trademark \u201cSprawl and Brawl\u201d style of fighting, a raw combination of martial arts fused with a bare-knuckle barroom technique. While he may not have displayed the finesse of other fighters, he was fueled by power and heart.\n\nIn 2005, despite his 9-2 amateur record, he considered retiring from the sport. On a whim, he responded for an audition notice for \u201cThe Ultimate Fighter,\u201d soon to become SPIKE TV\u2019s first mega hit. Although considered a long shot by the other contestants and a frequent target for pranks, Forrest prevailed. In the season finale, he defeated Stephan Bonnar by a unanimous decision. UFC owner Dana White called it the \"most important fight in UFC history\" since it brought the fledgling sport into the mainstream. It fight is also considered the best fight of all time. The grand prize was a professional contract to fight in the UFC. Electrified by his success, he retired from police service to pursue professional MMA full time.\n\nAfter winning three out of four matchups, Griffin was handed a major defeat by Keith Jardine at UFC 66 by way of TKO at 4:41 of the first round. After the fight, a visibly distraught Griffin walked away from announcer Joe Rogan's attempt to interview him, saying, \"Keith came in and he did exactly what he wanted to do, he knocked me the fuck out. Let's go home.\" Griffin then walked off camera, stranding Rogan. Moments later Griffin reappeared heading the opposite direction saying, \"I'll be back,\" and then immediately ran full speed out of the Octagon and disappeared into the locker room. Griffin was far from done.\n\nHe went on a tear with back-to-back victories against Hector Ramirez and Mauricio Rua. This set the stage for a showdown for the light heavyweight belt vs. Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson at UFC 86. Viewed as a heavy underdog, Griffin appeared to be finished after being dropped by a first round uppercut. He battled back, going toe to toe with the champ and landing a damaging leg kick in the second. In the third round, Griffin pummeled Jackson with ground strikes. The grueling bout went the distance. After a long pause by the announcer he won by a unanimous decision and was awarded the Light Heavyweight Championship Belt.\n\nForrest\u2019s first title defense came on December 27, 2008 at UFC 92 against undefeated Rashad \u201cSugar\u201d Evans. After 3 rounds of fighting and a broken hand, he lost his title. He then accepted a fight against Anderson \u201cThe Spider\u201d Silva, whom many consider the world\u2019s best fighter, at UFC 101, Forrest ended up with a loss, his first ever back to back losses. True to his nature, Forrest re-grouped and on short notice took a fight with Tito Ortiz at UFC 106. Forrest beat Tito and proved to fans why they love him, walking out to the words, \u201cI get knocked down, but I get up again\u201d with his walkout song, \u201cTubthumping\u201d by Chumbawamba.\n\nOutside of the octagon, Forrest is an ardent supporter of the USO and the Wounded Warrior Project, a nonprofit providing aid and empowerment for critically injured veterans. He also guest starred on the television series, Law & Order: SVU and has recently been doing a few movies that will come out in 2010.\n\nIn 2009, Forrest added New York Times Bestselling Author to his resume. His first book, \"Got Fight?\" published by Harper Collins, debuted at #5 on the NY Times Bestsellers List . He has his own columns in REVOLVER Magazine and FIGHT! Magazine.\n\nForrest's second book with Harper Collins, \u201cBe Ready When The Sh** Goes Down- A Survival Guide To The Apocalypse\u201d came out on August 3, 2010 and also hit the NYT best-seller list. www.forrestgriffin.net for more information.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"Married to my beautiful wife Jaime\n\nRepresented by Zinkin Entertaiment & Sports Management","talking_about_count":1859,"website":"www.forrestgriffin.net","were_here_count":0,"id":"150309641689359","name":"Forrest Griffin","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Forrest-Griffin\/150309641689359","likes":559109,"cover":{"cover_id":514457345274585,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1014085_514457345274585_1436568547_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"This is now officially the BIGGEST fanpage (by fans for fans) for Mariano Rivera! If you are a fan too,  Click \"LIKE\" to the right ==>","bio":"Mariano Rivera (born November 29, 1969) is a Panamanian baseball pitcher who has played 19 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees. Nicknamed \"Mo\",[1] Rivera has spent most of his career as a relief pitcher, and has served as the Yankees' closer since 1997. A 13-time All-Star and five-time World Series champion, he is MLB's career leader in saves (652) and games finished (952). His accolades include five American League (AL) Rolaids Relief Man Awards and three Delivery Man of the Year Awards.\nRivera was signed by the Yankees organization in 1990 as an amateur free agent in Panama, and he debuted in the major leagues in 1995. Initially a starting pitcher, he was converted to a relief pitcher late in his rookie year. After a breakthrough season in 1996 as a setup man, he became the Yankees' closer in 1997. In the following years, he established himself as one of baseball's top relievers, leading the major leagues in saves in 1999, 2001, and 2004, and finishing runner-up for the AL Cy Young Award in 2005. With his presence at the end of games to pitch the final innings, Rivera has been a key contributor to the Yankees' success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. An accomplished postseason performer, Rivera was named the 1999 World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) and the 2003 AL Championship Series MVP, and he holds several postseason records, including lowest earned run average (ERA) (0.70) and most saves (42). His pitching repertoire consists primarily of one pitch, a sharp-moving, mid-90s mile per hour (mph) cut fastball that has been called an all-time great pitch.[2]\nRivera is regarded by baseball experts as one of the most dominant relievers in major league history.[3] Pitching with a longevity and consistency uncommon to the closer role, he saved at least 25 games in 15 consecutive seasons and has posted an ERA under 2.00 in 11 seasons, both of which are records. His career 2.21 ERA and 1.00 WHIP are the lowest marks in baseball's live-ball era among pitchers with at least 1,000 innings pitched. On the field, he is well known for his composure and reserved demeanor that contrast with the effusiveness of fellow closers. Away from baseball, he is involved in charitable causes and the Christian community through the Mariano Rivera Foundation. Rivera is considered to be a strong candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame once he is eligible.[4]","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"We are a Fan Page ONLY.

At an early age, Hope developed a love for athletics, enjoying basketball, snowboarding, and beach volleyball in addition to soccer.  From 1996 to 1999, Hope competed as a forward for the Richland High School Bombers.  Over her high school career, she scored a total of 109 goals, including two in the State Championship game in 1999.  She was named a two-time Parade All-American.\n\nIn 1999, Hope went to play for the University of Washington Huskies where she switched to the goalkeeper position.   Hope quickly adapted to her new defensive role and was named a four-time All-Pac-10 athlete and a three-time NSCAA All-American.  As a senior, she was the only goalkeeper in contention for the prestigious Hermann Award, and left the Huskies\u2019 as Washington\u2019s all-time leader in shutouts (18), saves (325), and GAA (1.02).\n\nIn 2000, after having played on multiple U.S. Junior National soccer teams, Hope moved up to the full U.S. National Team.  In 2003, she was drafted to the WUSA\u2019s Philadelphia Charge.  Following her time with the Charge, she played for Kopparbergs\/G\u00f6teborg FC of G\u00f6teborg, Sweden in the Swedish Premier Division in 2004 and for Olympique Lyonnais in the French First Division in 2005.\n\nIn 2004, Hope was selected as an alternate for the U.S. Olympic Team, behind veteran Briana Scurry.  In 2005, Hope was promoted to the starting goalkeeper for the U.S. Team and started 7 matches, earning 7 shutouts.  In 2006, she played in 18 matches and her 1,054 minutes streak of preventing a goal from the run of play led the team to a 14-0-4 season.  In 2007, Hope started 15 games for a team record of 13-0-2, allowing only 8 goals. She also started four games in the 2007 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\n\nIn 2008, Hope had 9 shutouts in 16 starts leading up to the Olympics, playing in the Four Nations Tournament, the Algarve Cup, and the Peace Queen Cup.  In the summer of 2008, Hope once again joined the U.S. Women\u2019s Olympic Soccer team, this time as the starting goalkeeper.  In Beijing, the United States\u2019 team fought hard in the qualifying round and eventually advanced to the Gold Medal match against China.  The Gold Medal match was a defensive showdown.  Hope was able to fend off the aggressive Chinese offense, earning a shutout.  The U.S. won 1-0 in extra time to win the Gold Medal.\n\nIn September 2008, Hope was drafted to the St. Louis Athletica in the newly formed Women\u2019s Professional Soccer (WPS) league.  During the inaugural 2009 season, Hope led the Athletica to a second place finish in the regular season standings and to a berth in the WPS Playoffs.  Following the season, Hope was named the 2009 WPS Goalkeeper of the Year.  After the St. Louis Athletica folded in 2010, Hope began playing for the Atlanta Beat in WPS.  Hope started 16 games, finishing the 2010 season with a GAA of 1.75.\n\nImmediately following the 2010 WPS season, Hope underwent major shoulder surgery.  After 10 months of intensive rehab, Hope made her triumphant return to the pitch in April 2011 in a US National Team friendly versus England.  In the lead-up to the 2011 Women\u2019s World Cup, Hope returned to WPS, playing four games for the West Palm Beach magicJack.  \n\nDespite nearly one year off recovering from her shoulder injury, Hope entered the 2011 Women\u2019s World Cup as the US team\u2019s starting goalkeeper.  Hope recorded two shutouts to begin the group stage, helping the US to a second place finish in their group.  In the quarterfinal, the US faced a formidable Brazilian team.  After 90 minutes of regulation and 30 minutes of overtime, the two teams remained deadlocked.  In the ensuing penalty kick shootout, Hope was the hero, saving Brazil\u2019s third penalty kick.  The US calmly buried their 5 penalty kicks, winning the game and moving on to face France in the semifinal.  Hope was named Woman of the Match.  In the semifinal, the US soundly defeated France 3-1, with Hope making 7 critical saves.  In the final against Japan, Hope again came up big, making 4 saves during the run of play and 1 in the penalty kick shootout.  Though the US lost to Japan on penalty kicks, Hope received the Golden Glove as the best goalkeeper and the Bronze Ball as the third best player in the tournament.\n\nWhen not playing soccer, Hope enjoys reading, basketball, beach volleyball, and other outdoor activities.  She is interested in traveling the world and wants to give back through community service projects.\n","talking_about_count":5997,"username":"hopesolo","website":"www.twitter.com\/hopesolo","were_here_count":0,"id":"45872164821","name":"Hope Solo","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hopesolo","likes":1418274,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151181278394822","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/9158_10151181278394822_642725551_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Despite that achievement, Gammoudi was still virtually unknown when he arrived at the Tokyo Olympic Games. The favourite, world record holder Ron Clarke from Australia, ensured a fast tempo throughout the race. With one lap remaining, Clarke had dropped all his main rivals, except Gammoudi and Billy Mills from United States. Coming into the home straight, Mills, Clark and Gammoudi exchanged leads. With 50 m to go, Gammoudi had the lead, until Mills swept past Gammoudi to win the gold medal. Two days later, Gammoudi won his heat in the 5000 m, but for reasons never fully explained, he withdrew from the final.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":0,"id":"109438075748522","name":"Mohammed Gammoudi","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Mohammed-Gammoudi\/109438075748522","likes":107}

{"about":"Chris Bosh is an American professional basketball power forward-center with the Miami Heat of the NBA","bio":"Chris Bosh was born in Texas in 1984. He grew up playing basketball and baseball and started gaining national exposure as a star basketball player after his high school team finished the season 40-0 and won the Class 4A State Championship. Bosh went on to win the High School Player of the Year award by Basketball America and was named \"Mr. Basketball\" in Texas by the Texas Association of Basketball Coaches. Bosh began receiving scholarship offers from the majority of the best Division one schools in the nation and ended up deciding he would play at Georgia Tech, under coach Paul Hewitt.\n\nBosh made an immediate impact on Georgia Tech's team and went on to lead the team in scoring, rebounding and blocked shots. There was much speculation that Bosh would enter the NBA draft after his stellar freshman season and he did indeed announce that he would be entering the 2003 NBA Draft, although he had said that he would be very interested in finishing out his four years of college and earning his degree prior to his freshman season.\n\nAs the draft approached, many wondered if Bosh would even be selected in the top 10, due to a remarkably talented draft class. Lebron James was selected first in the draft that showcased players such as Carmelo Anthony and Dwayne Wade, and Bosh was selected fourth by the Toronto Raptors. Bosh became a regular starter for Toronto after Antonio Davis was traded and he had an excellent season, while earning an All-Rookie First Team honor. Bosh was considered one of the top young players in the league after his rookie season and many thought he might have MVP honors on the way.\n\nBosh has become a dominant player in recent years, though many believe that is mainly because he was the only star player on the Raptors. He has averaged a double double over the past two years and many analysts predict he will be a multiple time All-Star. Bosh may have been the second most popular free agent this year (only behind Lebron James) and if James were not a free agent this year he would have been the top prize in the free agent market. He was recently signed by the Miami Heat, along with Lebron James and Dwayne Wade. These three should be exciting to watch and it will be interesting to see how Bosh performs alongside these other two stars.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":21576,"username":"OfficialChrisBosh","were_here_count":0,"id":"257372997608848","name":"Bosh","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OfficialChrisBosh","likes":1354181,"cover":{"cover_id":588075077871970,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/532906_588075077871970_1365962527_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

His nickname is the 'Shadow'.\n\nDorian Andrew Mientjez Yates was born April 19, 1962 in England. Dorian was raised in Hurley, in rural Staffordshire. When he was a teenager, his family moved to Birmingham, Britain's second largest city. During these times, Dorian got himself into trouble, and was sentenced to six months at Whatton Youth Detention Centre.\n\nIt was here that Dorian earned an instant reputation as the strongest and fittest of Whatton's 300 inmates. This gave him new respect for himself. Whatton was the wake up call for Dorian. If he did not do something, he would end up in and out of prison all of his life. Dorian resolved that he would not be back.\n\nBorn in Hurley, Staffordshire, near Birmingham, England, Yates started working out in 1983. The man dubbed \u201cThe Shadow\u201d (by FLEX Editor-in-Chief Peter McGough) shone a new light of awareness onto training methods with his brief but very high-intensity workouts. After some muscle victories in England \u2013 1985 Novice Championships and 1988 British Championships \u2013 Yates visited New York for the 1990 Night of Champions and, in his pro debut, he took second to Mohamed Benaziza. The next year, he returned to win the contest.\n\nIn 1991, Yates was the runner-up at the Olympia to Lee Haney, who duly won his eighth record-setting Sandow and the retired. From 1992 through 1997, Yates dominated the sport\u2019s highest title. In 1994, he overcame a torn biceps to win the crown. In 1997, his most valiant victory came when he tore a triceps three weeks prior to the contest, but still battled on to triumph. Due to the injury, Yates was forced to retire, with a pro record of 15 wins and two second-place finishes.\n\nYates may well be the bodybuilder that most aspiring trainees can best identify with because of his blue-collar roots, dogged determination and quiet confidence. His book, co-written by Peter McGough, is titled A Warrior\u2019s Story \u2013 a perfect appellation for his competitive days for the Brit with no quit. Today, Yates still lives in Birmingham, where he is part owner of the supplement company Dorian Yates Ultimate Formulas, and he is still seen regularly at the main stateside contests.\n\nDorian has two children Lewis and Tahnee\n\n","birthday":"04\/19\/1962","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"Official Dorian Yates \nDorian Yates\n\"The Shadow\"\n\nBirth: \tApril 19, 1962 (1962-04-19) \n\n\nWarmley, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, England\nHeight: \t178cm (5ft 10in)\nWeight: \t110-122kg (242-269lb)\n","talking_about_count":58419,"username":"DorianYatesDY","were_here_count":0,"id":"34428725513","name":"Dorian Yates","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DorianYatesDY","likes":847587,"cover":{"cover_id":"10153429448530514","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/562361_10153429448530514_1180074841_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

As a bodybuilder, Lou won an IFBB Mr. America title and two consecutive IFBB Mr. Universe titles, and appeared in the bodybuilding documentary, Pumping Iron. As an actor, he is best known for portraying the title role in the CBS television series, The Incredible Hulk. He has also appeared in several European-produced fantasy\/adventure films such as Sinbad of the Seven Seas and Hercules. His most recent roles include a part in the 2009 feature film, I Love You, Man, and season five of the reality series, Celebrity Apprentice.\n\nLou was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Victoria and Matty Ferrigno. His father was an Italian-American police lieutenant. Soon after he was born, Lou suffered a series of ear infections and lost 75\u201380\u0025 of his hearing (though his condition was not diagnosed until he was three years old). Undeterred by what some may have perceived as a disadvantage, Lou threw himself into athletics (predominantly weightlifting and bodybuilding).\n\nLou started weight training at age 13, citing bodybuilder and Hercules-star Steve Reeves as one of his role models. He was also a fan of the Hercules films that starred Reeves \u2014 and would later himself play Hercules. Lou\u2019s other childhood heroes included Spider-Man and the Hulk. Lou attended St. Athanasius Grammar School and Brooklyn Technical High School, where he learned mechanical engineering.\n\nLou won his first major titles in 1973 \u2013 IFBB Mr. America and IFBB Mr. Universe \u2013 during which, he lived in Columbus, OH. Lou was only 21 when he won his first Mr. Universe title, a Guinness Book world record that stands to this day. In 1974, he came in second on his first attempt at the Mr. Olympia competition. He came in third the following year, which was documented in 1975\u2019s documentary, Pumping Iron.\n\nLou worked throughout his early bodybuilding career as a sheet metal worker in a Brooklyn factory. He did not enjoy the dangerous work, and left after a friend and co-worker accidentally cut off his hand. Following this, Lou left the competition circuit for many years, a period that included a brief stint as a defensive lineman for the Toronto Argonauts in the Canadian Football League. He had never played football and was cut after two games.\n\n1977 brought the release of the now-iconic bodybuilding documentary, Pumping Iron, and the attention of television producer Kenneth Johnson (Six Million Dollar Man, The Bionic Woman, V, Alien Nation), who was seeking the right person to portray the larger-than-life comic book superhero, The Incredible Hulk. With his 6\u2032 5\u2033, 285 lb. frame, Lou was the biggest professional bodybuilder at the time. He auditioned for the part of the green-skinned Goliath, winning the part over fellow bodybuilder, Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nLou was cast in the title role opposite Bill Bixby, who played his meek scientist alter ego. Although Lou and Bixby did not share lines on camera (except for one episode, \u201cKing of the Beach\u201d), the two were friends, with Lou describing Bixby as a \u201cmentor\u201d and \u201cfather figure\u201d who took Lou under his wing. Lou continued playing the Hulk role until 1981, although the last two episodes were not broadcast until May 1982. The Incredible Hulk was a huge ratings success and spawned several TV movies after the initial TV series completed its run\n\nLou continued to remain busy after the end of The Incredible Hulk. His subsequent films included Hercules (1983), Sinbad of the Seven Seas (1989) and Cage (1989).\n\nIn the early 1990s, Lou returned to bodybuilding, competing for the 1992 and 1993 Mr. Olympia titles. Finishing 12th and 10th, respectively, he then turned to the 1994 Masters Olympia, where his attempt to beat Robbie Robinson and Boyer Coe was the subject of the 1996 documentary, Stand Tall. After this, he retired from competition.\n\nLou\u2019s most recent credits include guest appearances on the CBS sitcom, The King of Queens, (beginning in 2000 and continuing until the program\u2019s conclusion in 2007, where he and his wife Carla were depicted as the main characters\u2019 next-door neighbors), Hulk (2003), The Incredible Hulk (2008), I Love You, Man (2009), The Avengers (2012), and Celebrity Apprentice: Season 5 (2012).\n\nMost recently, he launched a fitness and lifestyle website with his family, focused on positive habits, lifestyles, and ideas \u2013 FerrignoFIT.com.\n\nPERSONAL LIFE\n\nOn May 3, 1980, he married psychotherapist Carla Green, who then also began serving as his manager and later became a personal trainer herself. They have three children: Shanna (1981), Louie (1984), and Brent (1990).\n\nIn February 2006, Lou was sworn in as a Los Angeles County, California reserve sheriff\u2019s deputy and in November 2010, Lou was sworn in as a member of a Maricopa County, Arizona volunteer sheriff posse, which also includes actors Steven Seagal and Peter Lupus, in order to help control illegal immigration in the Phoenix Valley area.\n","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"DOB: November 9, 1951 - Brooklyn, New York, USA \n\nWife: Carla Ferrigno\n\nChildren: Shanna, Louie, Brent","talking_about_count":92365,"username":"LouFerrigno.Page","website":"www.louferrigno.com | www.ferrignofit.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"175286417298","name":"Lou Ferrigno","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LouFerrigno.Page","likes":935806,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151098355472299","source":"http:\/\/sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/551641_10151098355472299_11976635_n.jpg","offset_y":48,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Official Fan Page\n\nBabeRuth.com","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"    *  Babe Ruth's career mark of 714 home runs stood as the all-time record for 39 years, until Hank Aaron hit his 715th on Opening Day of the 1974 season.\n    * Babe Ruth is the only player ever to hit three home runs in a World Series game on two separate occasions-Game 4 of the 1926 Series and Game 4 of the 1928 Series.\n    * Babe Ruth reached the 500 home run plateau in 5801 at-bats--the second fewest number in history.\n    * Babe Ruth holds the record for the longest complete game victory in World Series history. In 1916, as a member of the Boston Red Sox, Ruth pitched 14 innings to defeat the Brooklyn Robins. He only allowed one run in the first inning, then settled down to shut out the Robins for the next 13 innings for the 2-1 win. The Red Sox would go on to win the Series in 5 games\n    * Babe Ruth led the American League in home runs 12 times (1918-1921, 1923, 1924, 1926-1931.)\n    * In 1927, Babe Ruth's 60 home runs accounted for 14\u0025 of all home runs in the American League that year. To put that figure in modern perspective, a player would need to hit over 340 home runs in a season to account for 14\u0025 of the American League's total homerun output.\n    * In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Babe and teammate Lou Gehrig were the most feared hitters in baseball. Remarkably, the dynamic duo combined to out-homer every team in the majors except one in 1927.\n    * From 1915-17, Ruth won 65 games, the most by any left-handed pitcher in the majors during that time.\n    * Ruth's career .690 slugging percentage is the highest total in the history of Major League Baseball.

{"about":"Welcome to Rory McIlroy's official Facebook page. We will keep you up to date with all the latest info on Rory.","bio":"In a nutshell, who or what am I?  I\u2019m a professional golfer who travels the globe playing the game I love. I am extremely fortunate to be able to play golf for a living and will continue to work as hard as I can to become the best player I can.\n\nI was born in Holywood, a small town in County Down, Northern Ireland, and not to be confused with the famous district in Los Angeles!  I took up golf pretty much as soon as I could walk and hold a club.  Ever since the day my Dad (who is a very handy golfer himself!) first put a club in my hand, I just took to it straight away.  I never stopped asking him to bring me down to our local golf course, I just couldn\u2019t get enough.\n\nDad tells me that I could drive the ball 40 yards when I was only 2 years old.  Since then, my parents were incredibly supportive; doing everything they could to help me become the best golfer I possibly could.  I learnt a lot of my early skills at Holywood Golf Club, which is still my home course.  I became the club\u2019s youngest member when I joined at just age 7.  My first big international success came in the World Championship for the 9\u201310 age bracket at the Doral Golf Resort & Spa in Miami, Florida.\n\nFrom then, my amateur career would flourish, enjoying many individual and team wins on my way to becoming World Number One in the Official Amateur Golf Ranking on February the 6th, 2007.  In July that same year, I would win the Silver Medal as leading amateur in the 136th Open Championship at Carnoustie.  On the 19th of September, I would turn professional the day before the British Masters, aged 17, and since then I have never looked back.\n\nI made the cut in my first professional event and finished 3rd in my second event, the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship. By finishing 4th in my next tournament, the Open de Madrid, I became the youngest Affiliate Member in the history of The European Tour to earn a tour card.  My professional career had got off to its dream start.\n\nI had a good 2008 season, including six top-10\u2019s and a runners up spot on my way to finishing 36th in the Order of Merritt.  I had to wait until 2009 to secure my maiden professional win at the Dubai Desert Classic.  An unforgettable experience in front of my parents and even though I let a few shots slip on the back nine, I held my nerve to seal the win.  I was particularly proud of how I got up and down on the final green while under immense pressure.  I shot up the world rankings to 16th after that win, and in April 2009 I played in my first Major tournament, The Masters, finishing a decent 20th.   At the end of 2009 I finished 2nd in the Race to Dubai and was ranked 9th in the world - not bad for my third year as a professional!\n\nThe following year, 2010, I made the decision to join the PGA Tour. I got my first PGA Tour win at the Quail Hollow Championship two days shy of my 21st birthday.  I finished with a 62, setting a new course record.  I would also perform well in the Majors in 2010, with top-3 finishes at The Open Championship and US PGA Championship.  One of the highlights of 2010 for me was definitely the Ryder Cup. It was great to be part of such an immense event and I really enjoyed the team aspect of it, something we don\u2019t generally experience in golf as professionals.  I hope to play in many more Ryder Cups over the coming years - there is simply no experience quite like it!\n\n2011 has been an incredible year for me.  Winning the US Open was the clear highlight but a lot happened before that to get me there.  At the Masters in April, I played some of the best golf of my life.  I became the youngest player ever to lead The Masters after the first day, shooting a 7-under 65.  I held on to my lead going into the final round but unfortunately had a bad Sunday and finished tied for 15th place.  Crucially, I learned a lot from that experience which I will benefit from for the rest of my career.\n\nWinning my first major, the US Open at Congressional was an incredible moment for me.  I broke a couple of records on the way as well - my 72-hole aggregate score of 268 (16-under) was a new U.S. Open record.  I also became the youngest winner since Bobby Jones in 1923.  Winning Majors is what golf is all about, and hopefully this my first of many.\n\nMy most recent win came at the Lake Malaren Shanghai Masters where I beat Anthony Kim in a playoff.  Although this is an unofficial event (because it was not sanctioned by any of the tours) it was great to get that winning feeling again as I drive towards the end of an unforgettable season.\n\nGolf is my passion and I hope my career continues to bring me as many good moments, both on and off the course, as I have already experienced in my first few years as a professional.\n\nHere\u2019s to hoping I can share many more good memories with you over the coming years.  Thanks for the continued support.\n\nRors","birthday":"05\/04\/1989","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":23493,"username":"RoryMcIlroy","website":"rorymcilroy.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"152976388115795","name":"Rory McIlroy","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/RoryMcIlroy","likes":336931,"cover":{"cover_id":463628750383889,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/303003_463628750383889_1584582246_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The Official Facebook Fan Page of Alex Rodriguez","awards":"Recent News: http:\/\/mlb.mlb.com\/players\/alex_rodriguez\/news\/index.jsp ","bio":"Alexander Emmanuel Rodriguez was born on July 27, 1975, in New York. When he was 4 years old, his parents moved the entire family to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. After a few years, they moved back to the United States and settled in Miami. Alex joined the Boys and Girls Clubs of Miami-Dade when he was 8 years old. While he played baseball occasionally as a very young child, he joined the Club team and began to play year round. While he was on this team, they won three city and two national championships.\n\nAlex attended Westminster Christian School for his last three years of high school. He earned All-American honors his junior and senior years, won the high school national championship his junior year and was considered the top prospect in the nation as a senior, garnering every top honor including All-American and USA Baseball Junior Player of the Year. While Alex signed a letter of intent to play at the University of Miami, he was selected as the No. 1 overall pick in 1993 MLB First-Year Player Draft, and signed with the Seattle Mariners instead.\n\nAlex began his professional baseball career in 1994 and played for the Mariners for seven seasons. He made his MLB debut on July 8, 1994, his first postseason appearance in 1995, and in 1996 had his first full Major League season. Before the end of his contract, Alex would make four All-Star Game appearances, win three Silver Slugger awards, become the third player to have a 40-40 season, win numerous national awards and finish in the top three for the MVP award twice.\n\nAlex became joined the Texas Rangers in 2001 and played there for three years. In that timeframe, Alex would make three All-Star Game appearances, win three Silver Slugger awards, win two Gold Glove awards, win three Hank Aaron awards and his first MVP award. He broke almost every Rangers' hitting record and became the youngest player ever to hit 300 home runs.\n\nOn Feb. 16, 2004, Alex was acquired by the New York Yankees in a blockbuster trade with the Rangers. With a new team also came a new uniform number -- No. 13 -- and a new position -- third base. As a Yankee, Alex has made seven All-Star Game appearances, won three Silver Slugger awards, won a Hank Aaron award and two MVP awards. He hit his 500th career home run on Aug. 4, 2007. Alex also achieved his lifelong dream of winning it all. The Yankees beat the Philadelphia Phillies on Nov. 4, 2009, and won their 27th world championship. And since 2009, Alex has continued to reach milestones, including collecting 1,000 hits as a Yankees (only the 39th player to do so), stealing his 300th career base and hitting his 600th home run on Aug. 4, 2010. He is the youngest player ever to reach this plateau and the seventh player overall.\n\nWhile busy on the field, Alex has found plenty of time to be involved in charitable endeavors as well. He works extensively with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Miami-Dade. He hosts fundraising dinners, Christmas parties and youth baseball clinics and donated nearly $1 million to the Club since 1998. He also partnered with Microsoft in 2004 to provide computers and software to Boys and Girls Clubs across the country: each time he had an RBI, a complete computer with operating software was donated to the club in that city. More than 100 systems were donated that season. In 2009, the Club opened the Alex Rodriguez Education Center, an 8,000 square-foot facility with three classrooms, a computer technology lab and a teen center. Alex made a multi-million dollar donation to the University of Miami in 1993. While the majority of the money was earmarked to renovate Mark Light Field, a perpetual scholarship was endowed for a Dade County high school graduate affiliated with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Florida as well. Alex also works with the Columbia University School of Dentistry's Community DentCare program, which funds mobile dental centers in Washington Heights and the Bronx in New York City. His donation of $250,000 will fund the mobile units for five years. He also donated $250,000 to Bronx Lebanon Hospital. This donation allowed the hospital to complete construction on the new pediatric outpatient unit, aimed at providing quality medical attention for local children who are not covered by insurance.\n\nIn addition to these projects, Alex has donated more than $200,000 to the Children's Aid Society of New York, $50,000 to UNICEF, hosted fundraisers for the Ronald McDonald House, funded a Bronx Little League team and regularly makes speaking appearances in Washington Heights and the Bronx. He continues to donate autographed merchandise to charities for auction purposes, appear at youth baseball clinics in the United States and Latin America and hosts children at sporting events who might otherwise not be able to purchase tickets. Alex has written two children's books, with part of the proceeds going to charity, and has donated many of the books to Boys and Girls Clubs across the country.","birthday":"07\/27\/1975","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":2039,"username":"AROD","website":"AROD.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"255853114446305","name":"Alex Rodriguez","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AROD","likes":1108982,"cover":{"cover_id":425741057457509,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/599855_425741057457509_985620976_n.jpg","offset_y":25,"offset_x":0}}

{"affiliation":"Portland Trail Blazers","birthday":"07\/23\/1984","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Portland","state":"OR","country":"United States","zip":""},"personal_info":"Brandon Roy, known around basketball circles simply as \u201cB Roy,\u201d was born on July 23rd, 1984 in Seattle, Washington. He grew up in Seattle spending his free time on the basketball court and emulating his favorite player, Michael Jordan. A standout since early childhood, Brandon really started turning heads when he stepped on the court for Garfield High School. \nBrandon was one of the best all-around players in Washington, and his efforts on the court were recognized instantly. He won MVP of the KingCo Conference in both his junior and senior seasons. During his senior year, Brandon started receiving national attention with averages of 22.3 points and 10.4 rebounds per game. In his final high school game, he scored a career high of 38 points to narrowly lead his team to a 71-70 victory and the Class 4A state tournament 4th place trophy. Brandon quickly became a consensus top 50 player in America and was forced to decide between college basketball and the NBA. \n\nBrandon entered his name in the 2002 NBA draft; however, he didn\u2019t attend any pre-draft camps and eventually withdrew his name from the list. He instead decided to attend the University of Washington. Happy to be playing close to home, Roy began a stellar collegiate career as a Husky during the 2002-2003 season. During his sophomore campaign, Roy played a prominent role on the team when he led the squad in rebounding. He was also second in points, steals, and assists. More importantly, he helped lead the team to its best conference finish (2nd) since 1986, and its first NCAA Tournament berth since 1999. \n\nA meniscus tear in his right knee forced Brandon to the bench his junior year. However, after a strong recovery, B Roy returned to the lineup the next year to lead his team to a Pac-10 Conference Tournament Championship, a number one seed in the NCAA Tournament, and a trip to the Sweet 16. Brandon strongly contemplated entering the NBA Draft again after his junior season but elected to return to UW to finish his education and to play one more season under coach Lorenzo Romar. \u201cAt the end of my junior year I felt like I was ready to take my game to the NBA, but there was still more I needed to show,\u201d Brandon said. \n\nB Roy did indeed prove he was one of the nation\u2019s elite talents during his stellar senior season by ranking in the top 10 of the PAC-10 in 13 statistical categories, including leading the conference in scoring at 22 points per game. Those numbers were good enough to declare Brandon the Pac-10 Player of the Year, as well as a first team All-American. \u201cAfter my senior year I felt like everything was complete. I was a first team All-American, I was PAC-10 Player of the Year \u2013 I really answered a lot of questions about my ability to lead a team. I thought at the end of this year I was finally ready to be a pro,\u201d Brandon said before draft day. \n\nAfter his historic senior year, B Roy brought his talents to the NBA Draft. Recalling his memories from draft night Brandon admitted, \u201cDraft night was incredible. I was extremely excited \u2013 I think I hid it pretty well. I kept reminding myself: \u2018B, you\u2019ve done all you can do at this point. You have no regrets.\u2019\u201d He was selected with the 6th overall pick in the draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, only to be traded just minutes later to the Portland Trailblazers. When asked about being dealt to the Blazers, Roy responded, \u201cI was excited \u2013 that\u2019s what I wanted to happen. I feel like with me, LaMarcus, and the rest of the young guys we have, they are putting a lot of faith in the youth. I\u2019m pretty excited \u2013 I was happy when they finally said I was traded and it was done. I took my Minnesota hat off, thrilled to be with Portland.\u201d \n\nAfter an extremely successful summer league, B Roy was experts\u2019 pick for Rookie of the Year. Roy\u2019s rookie year did not disappoint as he was the run-away selection for Rookie of the Year, receiving 127 of the 128 first place votes. He averaged rookie highs of 16.8 points, 4.0 assists and 35.4 minutes in 57 games. Brandon carried that momentum into his second season where he averaged 19.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 5.8 assists in 74 games. He was selected to the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, where he led the Western Conference in minutes and tied for the most points in the West, scoring 18. Brandon has become the leader of the league\u2019s youngest team, looking to lead the team into the playoffs and to establish a new era of hoops in Portland.","talking_about_count":390,"username":"Brandonroy","website":"http:\/\/www.broy7.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"40102703287","name":"Brandon Roy","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Brandonroy","likes":302189,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151027589638288","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/251902_10151027589638288_2098551428_n.jpg","offset_y":48,"offset_x":0}}

Sagna made 87 Ligue 1 appearances for Auxerre and was part of the squad that won the French Cup in 2005. He also played in the UEFA Cup in each of his three seasons with the club's first team, making a total of 17 appearances in the competition. He was also voted into the Ligue 1 team of the season for his outstanding displays at the right back position. On 12 July 2007, Sagna completed a move to Arsenal from Auxerre where he wears the number 3 shirt.\n\nArsenal\n2007\u201308 season\nOn 12 July 2007, Sagna completed a move to Arsenal from Auxerre for an undisclosed fee, thought to have been an initial \u20ac9 million that could rise to \u20ac11 million. \n\nBacary Sagna, made his debut for Arsenal on 19th July 2007 as a starter in the squad that beat Turkish club Genclerbirligi 3-0 in a friendly at Austria's Bad Waltersdorf Stadion. On 23 March, Sagna tallied his first league goal off a header from a corner kick to give Arsenal a 1-0 lead against London rivals Chelsea, but later went off injured before Chelsea came back to win the game 2-1. At the end of the season, he was named in the PFA Team of the Year.\n\n\n2008\u201309 season\nSagna signed a new deal with Arsenal before the start of the 2008\u201309 season. Arsenal have signed him for a further two years, taking his contract up to 2014.\n\nInternational Duty: Bacary Sagna started by represending France for the under-21 team, with whom he also participated at the 2006 European Under-21 Championship.\n\nSenior International Career: Bacary received his first senior international cap for France on 22 August 2007 in a friendly match against Slovakia on the road, which they won 1-0, coming on as a substitute for Francois Clerc after one hour of play. He went on to make his competitive debut for France in their 6-0 away win at the Faroe Islands on 13 October 2007 in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers, playing all 90 minutes. It was his only appearance in the Euro 2008 qualifying. He was not a candidate to join the French team at the Euro 2008 finals in Austria and Switzerland as he was still recovering from the injury sustained in Arsenal's Premier League match at Chelsea in March 2008. After recovering from the injury, Sagna returned to the French national team for their friendly match against Sweden in August 2008, playing all 90 minutes in a 3-2 away win for France. He went on to become a regular in the French team's qualifying campaign for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, so far starting all of their five matches in the competition.\n\n\n","birthday":"02\/14\/1983","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":83045,"username":"BacarySagnaOfficial","website":"http:\/\/www.bacarysagna.net\/, https:\/\/twitter.com\/sagnaofficial","were_here_count":0,"id":"262404642955","name":"Bacary Sagna","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BacarySagnaOfficial","likes":718334,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151701269882956","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc1\/s720x720\/579097_10151701269882956_604198935_n.jpg","offset_y":51,"offset_x":0}}

The quiet, even pensive individual is a world-renowned boxing superstar, professional basketball player, entrepreneur, music producer, performer, actor and all around nice guy. \n\nAny observer can see his accomplishments and wonder, \u201chow can one man do so much?\u201d Yet, this is just the tip of the iceberg!  Not only can Roy count victories round after round he can easily shift gears to music \u2013 his other love. \n\nSince 1998 Roy Jones, Jr. has been CEO of his independent record label located in Pensacola, FL.  Entering the music industry is another way Roy is giving back.  As he has been quoted \u201cI want to develop talent right here in Pensacola because there is a lot here.\u201d  Seeing that talent and nurturing it is what Royalty Records, formerly, Body Head Entertainment, is all about.  Roy has signed artists who are just as hungry as he is to succeed.  \u201cOur goal is to make Royalty Records among the elite independent record labels.  \n\nIt seems that Roy Jones, Jr. has definitely earned his life\u2019s \u201cbrass ring.\u201d  Giving back that \u201cbrass ring\u201d quality is another goal Roy has made a part of his life.  Every year in May, Roy hosts a golf tournament for kids.  He also makes a point of speaking to America\u2019s youth as often as possible to promote the value of education and a drug free life.\n\nBorn January 16, 1969 in Pensacola, FL, Roy Jones, Jr. enjoys the simple things in life: he raise animals on his farm, and he loves to go in the gulf to go fishing on his boat. He demolishes anyone who threatens his skills in basketball and on the pool table, and he also enjoys fishing at home in his man-made pond.  \n\nMusic is the outlet for Roy to express himself.  Through his positive lyrics about life, he explains the person he is both in and out of the boxing ring.  \u201cLife is what we make it and we have to live our life to the fullest and do what makes us happy\u201d states Roy.  True to his words, Roy is doing just that.\n\nAdditionally, Roy has toured with his boxing icon and childhood hero Muhammad Ali on his cross-country goodwill campaign to deliver positive life messages to schoolchildren.  Being a father himself, Roy consistently demonstrates how a positive lifestyle affects the youth.  Roy also gives back to the community by teaching kids the art of boxing as well as numerous lessons in everyday life.  It\u2019s no wonder he was honored in Pensacola for his humanitarian efforts.\n\nWithout a doubt, Roy is proving that he is \u201cA True Champion,\u201d whether the medium is entertainment, music, acting, basketball or boxing.  He sets his sights on a goal and pummels it.  As Roy puts it \u201cI\u2019m the quiet storm that keeps on banging.\u201d  Get ready for another knockout coming soon!\n\nWHERE ELSE TO SEE ROY JONES, JR.:\n\nNike\/Brand Jordan Advertisements\nMatrix II \u2013 2003\nFight Night - EA Sports Video Game \nFatherhood Show with Snoop\nHBO 24\/7 Series\n ","personal_interests":"Fishing and Basketball","talking_about_count":1561,"username":"theofficialroyjonesjr","website":"www.myspace.com\/theofficialroyjonesjr\nwww.royalteymgmt.com\nwww.royjonesjrfoundation.com\nwww.royaltyrecordsonline.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"101946485221","name":"Roy Jones Jr","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theofficialroyjonesjr","likes":253222,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150882048925222","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/306904_10150882048925222_155023664_n.jpg","offset_y":50,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The official WWE Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Brock Lesnar. Here comes The Pain! ","affiliation":"WWE","awards":"WWE Champion; 2003 Royal Rumble Match winner; 2002 King of the Ring","bio":"Think all men are created equal? Then how do you explain Brock Lesnar?\n\nPossessing the type of staggering strength and scary intensity usually only seen in Superman villains, the 6-foot-3, 266-pound freak of nature from Minneapolis, Minn., has forced his way to the top of every major combat sport. He won the NCAA Division I collegiate wrestling championship as a senior at the University of Minnesota, the WWE Championship within six months of his debut and the UFC Heavyweight Title in his fourth professional MMA fight. Plain and simple, the man was built to destroy.\n\nFirst scouted by WWE officials while smashing his way through the college wrestling ranks, Brock Lesnar debuted on Raw on March 18, 2002 and singlehandedly destroyed a ring full of unfortunate Superstars. From that night on, the domination was unrepentant. With the sinister Paul Heyman guiding his career, \u201cThe Next Big Thing\u201d won the King of the Ring tournament in June and beat The Rock to win the WWE Title at SummerSlam. On that night, the punishing big man became the youngest WWE Champion in history and the fastest rising star sports-entertainment had ever seen.\n\nLike a runaway train, Lesnar was impossible to stop. He manhandled The Undertaker in a way no competitor had ever done before and made \u201cThe Immortal\u201d Hulk Hogan appear disturbingly vulnerable in defeat. Some Superstars look like they were chiseled out of granite \u2014 Lesnar looked like he was blasted out of the side of a mountain with dynamite. How else could you explain the way he heaved Big Show through the air as if the giant was a cruiserweight? In an industry filled with seriously strong men, this type of power had never been seen.\n\nIt became clear that Brock Lesnar held skills that few men possess. He wasn\u2019t just strong, he was built to survive. Drop this man in the middle of the frozen wilderness with nothing but a Swiss army knife and he\u2019ll walk out of the woods a week later wearing a grizzly bear for a coat.\n\nBetting men would have put their money on The Next Big Thing carrying WWE through the decade, but Lesnar shocked the sports-entertainment world when he announced he was leaving WWE in 2004. Following a controversial loss to Goldberg at WrestleMania XX, the dangerous athlete pursued mixed martial arts where he conquered the cage for more than three years.\n\nIt looked like Lesnar was headed for retirement from there, until the hulking competitor walked out on Raw on the day after WrestleMania XXVIII and obliterated John Cena with his F-5 finishing maneuver. Since that shocking night, the beast has dominated the Cenation leader on pay-per-view, reintroduced the eely Paul Heyman to WWE and beat Triple H at SummerSlam \u2014 and then abruptly quit.\n\nAgain Brock returned, this time to lay waste to Mr. McMahon. Lesnar\u2019s disgusting actions sent him into a second head-on collision with The Game \u2014 this time at WrestleMania where Triple H managed to survive a hellish bout with the manmade monster. Their war is not over, though. As the two behemoths barrel towards Extreme Rules, Brock disrespected Triple H by invading his workplace at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Conn., and tearing it apart.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Minneapolis","state":"MN","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":17066,"username":"thebrocklesnar","website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars\/brock-lesnar","were_here_count":0,"id":"305386502866189","name":"Brock Lesnar - WWE","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thebrocklesnar","likes":780746,"cover":{"cover_id":470127063058798,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/529507_470127063058798_88355475_n.jpg","offset_y":37,"offset_x":0}}

{"category":"Interest","description":"Alexander Mikhaylovich Ovechkin is a Russian professional ice hockey winger and captain of the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL). Prior to playing in the NHL, Ovechkin played for HC Dynamo Moscow of the Russian Superleague for four seasons from 2001 until 2005, and he played for Dynamo again (this time in the Kontinental Hockey League) during the 2012\u201313 NHL lockout. Ovechkin was the first overall selection in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft, drafted from Dynamo after 3 seasons with the club. Since the 2004\u201305 NHL season was lost because of a lockout, Ovechkin remained with Dynamo for one more season before transferring to the NHL for the 2005\u201306 NHL season, in which he won the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year, scoring 52 goals and 54 assists to lead all rookies with 106 points.During the 2007\u201308 season, he led the NHL with 65 goals and 112 points to capture the Rocket Richard and Art Ross Trophies. That season he also won the Lester B. Pearson Award as the top player voted by the NHL Players' Association and the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's MVP. He is the only player to win all four awards since the Rocket Richard Trophy's inception in 1999. He would lead Team Russia to a gold medal at the World Championships the same year. In 2009, he again won the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP, the Lester B. Pearson Award, and the Rocket Richard Trophy. Ovechkin also led the Capitals to their second consecutive division title. He won the Ted Lindsay Award, which the Pearson Award had been renamed, for a third straight year in 2010, as well as being named to the First All-Star Team for a fifth consecutive season. Ovechkin remained among league leaders in scoring in the 2010\u201311 NHL season (85 points, 7th in the NHL) and among the league leaders in goals scored in the 2011\u201312 NHL season (38 goals, 5th in the NHL).

","bio":"According to Ali.com:\n\nHis success as a boxer is widely respected, but Ali's greatest triumph lies in his legacy as a champion, leader, humanitarian, and artist. His work both inside and outside the ring truly makes Muhammad Ali \"The Greatest of All Time.\"\n\nAs a boxer, Muhammad brought unprecedented speed and grace to his sport, while his charm and wit changed forever what the public expected a champion to be. His accomplishments in the ring are the stuff of legend \u2013 two fights with Sonny Liston, where he proclaimed himself \"The Greatest\" and proved he was; three epic wars with Joe Frazier; the stunning victory over George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle; and dethroning Leon Spinks to become heavyweight champion for an unprecedented third time. But there was always far more to Muhammad than what took place in a boxing ring.\n\nMuhammad's life and career have been played out as much on the front pages of newspapers as on the inside sports pages. His early relationship with the Nation of Islam and his insistence on being called Muhammad Ali instead of his \"slave name,\" Cassius Clay, heralded a new era in black pride. His refusal to be inducted into the United States Army anticipated the growing antiwar movement of the 1960's. His willingness to stage his much-promoted and publicized fights in such far-flung locales as Kinshasa, Manila, and Kuala Lumpur signaled a shift from superpower dominance toward a growing awareness of the developing world.\n\nDaring to go against political policy to help people in need, Muhammad has made goodwill missions to Afghanistan and North Korea; delivered sorely-needed medical supplies to an embargoed Cuba; traveled to Iraq and secured the release of 15 United States hostages during the first Gulf War; and journeyed to South Africa to meet Nelson Mandela upon his release from prison.\n\nToday, championing the issues in the developing world has become a major focus of Muhammad's life. He has been instrumental in providing over 232 million meals to the world's hungry. Traveling across continents, he has hand-delivered food and medical supplies to children in Cote D'Ivoire, Indonesia, Mexico, and Morocco among other countries.\nIn addition to his international efforts, Muhammad is equally devoted to helping charities at home. He has visited countless numbers of soup kitchens and hospitals, and helped such organizations as the Make-A-Wish-Foundation and the Special Olympics. At the State Capitol in Michigan, he advocated new laws for protecting children.\n\nHe annually participates in \"Fight Night,\" which generates funds for the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Research Center at Barrow Neurological Institute, in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nHe is also the namesake of the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, a federal law that regulates professional boxing to protect boxers from unscrupulous promoters and poor health and bout conditions. Muhammad has testified before the United States Senate several times regarding boxing reform.","category":"Athlete","category_list":[{"id":"1600","name":"Athlete"}],"checkins":37,"is_published":true,"location":{"street":"144 N.

{"affiliation":"Detroit Pistons","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"Tracy McGrady, known to the world as \u201cT-Mac,\u201d was born on May 24, 1979 in Bartow, FL., to Melanise Williford. He grew up in Auburndale, FL., and is the product of an area called \u201cThe Hill\u201d in Auburndale. A quaint town of about 9,000, it is surrounded by lakes and rests between Orlando and Tampa. Tracy\u2019s family has been a major influence in his life. Raised by his mother, Melanise and grandmother, Roberta, Tracy grew to know both women as Mom.\n\nHIGH SCHOOL\nAt Auburndale High, he quickly became a two-sport star. He loved baseball and had aspirations of playing in the Major Leagues. Some Auburndale coaches were certain that McGrady would be playing in a Major League ballpark instead of on a NBA court.\nTracy\u2019s hoops tale began in his junior year at Auburndale High. He averaged 23.1 pts and 12.2 rebounds a game with the Bloodhounds during the season. But despite the great numbers, Tracy was not receiving the type of attention that someone with his talents normally got. The only schools that showed interest in him were Florida and Miami.\n\nAfter his junior year at Auburndale High School in Florida, he was invited to play in the ABCD Camp. Tracy was still looking for a way to put himself on the map and let the basketball world know who he was. During the senior all-star game, he dribbled down the left wing on a fast break and found only James Felton, a 6\u20199\u201d blue-chipper from NJ committed to St Johns, between him and the basket. Tracy went up, cupped the ball in his right hand, and threw down a windmill dunk over James. He sent the whole gym into frenzy. \u201cAfter I made that dunk, I had chills run through my body. It\u2019s like the moment I knew I had finally arrived,\u201d Tracy said. The recruiting newsletter \u201cHoop Scoop\u201d praised Tracy as \u201cthe sleeper of the decade.\u201d While he was not included in the list of the top 500 prospects before the summer, Tracy was ranked #2 behind Lamar Odom, in the next edition of the list. He was even featured in a 3-page article in the February 10, 1997 issue of Sports Illustrated.\n\nJoe Hopkins, the basketball coach at Mount Zion Christian Academy in Durham, North Carolina, received a call about Tracy from Alvin Jones Jr., a basketball coach at Kathleen High, a neighboring High School to Auburndale High. While in the area, Hopkins stopped by to meet with Tracy and his \u201cmoms.\u201d Hopkins offered Tracy a scholarship to Mount Zion, and the rest is history.\n\nHis senior season he transferred to play one year at Mount Zion Christian Academy in North Carolina, which turned out to be a very successful experience. Tracy has said that Joe Hopkins has been a big part of his life. Joe taught him to respect others, himself, and the game. \u201cHe\u2019s my backbone,\u201d Tracy says. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Coach Hopkins, none of this would be possible.\u201d\n\nHe led the Mighty Warriors of Mount Zion to a 20-1 record, earning the spot as the #2 team in the nation in USA TODAY\u2019s Super 25. As a senior, he averaged 27.5 points, 8.7 rebounds, 7.7 assists and 2.8 steals per game while shooting .564 from the field, .389 from three-point range and .791 from the free throw line. He was named the USA Today \u201cPlayer of the Year,\u201d \u201cPlayer of the Year\u201d in the state of North Carolina by The Associated Press, and was named to the McDonald\u2019s All-American Team. By this time, Tracy had begun receiving the attention from all the top schools that he never heard from early in his high school career. As Tracy was getting set to commit to Kentucky, he was also receiving an abundance of interest from NBA teams and agents. Tracy wrestled with the decision, but ultimately decided to take his talents to the NBA rather than attend college.\n\nTHE NBA\nThe 6-foot-8, 200-pound prep-star, who played all five positions at Durham\u2019s Mount Zion Christian Academy, announced his decision to make himself available for the June 25 1997 NBA draft. \u201cI feel this is the best decision for me and my family,\u201d said Tracy, \u201cI considered college, but my dream is to make it to the top, and I had a chance to do that earlier.\u201d\nOn draft day, with question marks concerning if and when Tracy would get drafted, he was the 9th pick by the Toronto Raptors. On that day he joined the list of players like Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, and Jermaine O\u2019Neal, who successfully made the jump from high school to the NBA. Tracy\u2019s success paved the path for numerous other prep-to-pro NBA players before the NBA instituted a rule in 2006 requiring players to be at least 19 and one year removed from high school before entering the league.\nTracy\u2019s stint with the Raptors lasted from 1997-2000, and gave him the opportunity to play alongside his cousin, Vince Carter. The duo were contestants in the NBA\u2019s Slam dunk contest in 2000, where Carter edged out McGrady for the title.\n\nAfter a few seasons in Carter\u2019s shadow, Tracy was traded to the Orlando Magic in 2000 for a first round draft pick. The trade paid off immediately for the Magic as McGrady blossomed into a superstar in Orlando. In his first season in Florida, Tracy won the NBA\u2019s Most Improved Player Award, and was named as a starter for the Eastern Conference All-Star Team. Two seasons later he won the NBA\u2019s scoring title by scoring over 32 points a game, making him the youngest winner of the prestigious title since the NBA\/ABA merger. The following season McGrady won the scoring title again, averaging 28 points a game. He also scored his career-high of 62 points that season against the Washington Wizards on March 10, 2004.\n\nDespite Tracy\u2019s personal success, the Magic never made it into the league\u2019s elite, and in June of 2004, Tracy was traded to the Houston Rockets in a seven-player deal. The trade gave him a fresh start on a new team, and also paired him up with 7\u20196\u201d Yao Ming. After taking some time to adjust to his new team, Tracy led them to a fifth place finish in the Western Conference, but the team was eliminated by the Dallas Mavericks in a hard fought seven game series. The 2005-06 season was plagued by injuries for Tracy, and the Rockets failed to reach the playoffs. In 2006-07 Tracy led the Rockets to a 52-win season, their best finish in over a decade, but lost a tough series in 7 games to the Utah Jazz. Visibly emotional after the series, Tracy vowed to do everything in his power to take the Rockets even further in the 2007-2008 season. In 2008 the Rockets won 22 consecutive games in a row, for the 2nd longest winning streak in NBA history. The Rockets entered the post season in the 5th seat and once again faced the Utah Jazz. Even in the absence of Yao Ming, who suffered a broken foot in February to keep him out of the second half of the season, the Rockets fought hard, even taking game 3 on Utah\u2019s home court. Despite McGrady\u2019s 40 points and 10 rebounds, the Rockets lost game six and were once again knocked out in the first round (4-2).\n\nTracy McGrady has racked up numerous individual accolades and continues to be one of the league\u2019s most recognizable stars. He has been selected to the All-Star Team 7 times since 2001 and has been an All-NBA selection 7 times as well. In 2007, his image appeared on the cover of NBA Live 07.\nOff The Court\n\nDespite his success, Tracy has not limited himself to working solely on the court. Tracy is involved in his foundation, The Tracy McGrady Foundation, and is very active in the Florida and Houston communities. He has taken numerous trips to Asia, to serve as an ambassador for basketball and, most recently, has become very involved in the Enough Project to help with the crisis in Darfur.\nTracy took a trip to the region in the summer of 2007, to give himself a better understanding of the situation. \u201cI still don\u2019t know why, but I knew I had to go.\u201d Tracy said, \u201cI could have read about it, seen it on TV. People can tell you. But you have to be hands-on to get the full effect, to really understand the devastation, the sadness of it all.\u201d Tracy brought a film crew with him to make the documentary, \u201c3 Points\u201d about his trip and to get the word out. He is fully committed to do everything he can to help the crisis.\n\nPERSONAL\nTracy and his wife CleRenda Harris have two daughters, Layla Clarice and Laycee Aloe, and one son Laymen Lamar.\nTracy\u2019s younger brother Chance McGrady plays for the Memphis Tigers basketball team who reached the 2008 NCAA Finals Championship game.","talking_about_count":10912,"username":"TracyMcGrady","website":"http:\/\/www.t-mac.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"39494163418","name":"Tracy McGrady","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TracyMcGrady","likes":1610654,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151198824628419","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/379059_10151198824628419_1249088535_n.jpg","offset_y":11,"offset_x":0}}

Gronkowski also finished fifth in fan balloting at tight end for the 2011 Pro Bowl, and fourth overall among rookies\n\nAs a true freshman in 2007, Gronkowski recorded 28 receptions for 525 yards and six touchdowns. His 18.8 yards per reception average was the best on the team and his receiving yards were a then school record for a tight end. He was named a The Sporting News freshman All-American, Rivals.com freshman All-American, The Sporting News freshman Pac-10, and All-Pac-10 honorable mention player.\n\nHe was twice named the John Mackey National Tight End of the Week, including for his performance in a failed comeback bid against Oregon, where he caught 12 passes for 143 yards. He set the school tight end records for single-game, single-season, and career receptions, yards, and touchdowns.

It was an excellent choice, I think,\u2019\u2019 Gronkowski said via conference call. \u201cI knew that one of their needs was tight end. I just believe it\u2019s a great fit, a great team.

His first Premiership brace for the Spurs came on December 9, 2006 in a 5-1 victory against Charlton Athletic, following which he came on as a substitute in the second half of the match against Fulham at the Football Association (FA) Cup and netted his first two goals at the competition. Dimitar Berbatov was also named the Man of the Match in a 4-1 win against the Bolton Wanderers and became joint winner of the FA Premier League Player of the Month award for April along with Robbie Keane, a Spurs team-mate. \n\nDimitar Berbatov scored his first away goal at the Premier League in a 2-1 win against Everton, and on May 7, 2007 he scored Tottenham\u2019s 100th goal of the 2006-07 season, which was the first goal of the match, a 2-0 win over Charlton Athletic. He finished that season with 12 Premiership goals and became one of the players to have two goals included in the BBC's goal of the month competition shortlist. For his impressive performances, Dimitar Berbatov won the Tottenham Hotspur Fans' Player of the Year (2006-07) and the Bulgarian footballer of the Year in 2002, 2004, 2005 and 2007.\n\nOn April 21, 2007, Dimitar Berbatov was named in the FA Premier League's PFA Team of the Season, becoming the only player of the three players in the list to have not played for Manchester United. He was also instrumental in helping the Spurs lift the Football League Cup during 2007-08.

{"about":"WWW.TYLERMCPEAK.COM\nChampion Performance Sponsored Athlete","bio":"Born and raised in Roanoke Virginia and now currently living in Nashville Tennessee working as a personal trainer. At age 18 I became addicted to the pump and fell in love with training. When my body started changing, I became obsessed and hungry for more. After a solid year of training in the basement, I had the courage to join a gym, but I didn't realize how important nutrition was. My appetite was low, so I force-fed myself during the first few years. At age 21, I decided to give back through my knowledge and become a personal trainer. I weighed 255 pounds at the time and had a huge appetite. It wasn't a good 255 pounds because I was on a \"see food\" diet where I ate anything in sight. My daily food choices were pizza, burgers, and more burgers. I always was interested in competing, but my height ruled out the bodybuilding stage.\nIn 2007, I decided to compete at Universe Weekend in Miami, Florida, in the fitness modeling division and cut down from 255 to 215 pounds. I didn't know much about nutrition or how to implement cardio, so I wasn't happy with my look. I placed 25 out of 75 guys and was approached by Adam Silver of Silver Model Management. He set up my first photo shoot the day after competition and talked to me about coming to New York City.\nI didn't hear much after the shoot, so I wrote it off. Then I received a random phone call a few months later from Adam who asked if I could be in Washington, D.C., the next day because he might have booked Under Armour. I was extremely excited. He called later that day and confirmed that I was booked for the Under Armour catalog. I later appeared on the cover.\nAfter the Under Armour shoot, I gave fitness modeling a valiant effort and moved to New York City. I competed again at 210 pounds for the Universe Weekend show in Miami in 2009, and placed 9 out of 100. I was happy with my condition because it was the leanest I had ever been. After living in New York for a year, I got mixed up with the wrong crowd and partying became my priority. The fashion industry rules New York, so I decided to give that a shot for potentially more money.\nAt the end of 2008, I quit lifting weights with the intent to get skinny. I did lots of cardio and my focus switched to joining a top 10 fashion modeling agency. Jason Kanner, who worked for Major Models at the time, signed me and I thought I was golden. That wasn't the case. My partying priorities kept up and I eventually developed an eating disorder. My plan of attack was to lose weight and get skinny by starving myself. I only ate a few tiny meals per day and smoked cigarettes to kill my appetite. Days of starving usually led to all-out binges. I ate large amounts of food then did what felt like endless cardio to compensate.\nI fell into a deep depression and the eating disorder continued for several months. That prompted me to leave New York and move to Nashville, where my life turned around. I went back to my roots and picked up the weights again. I can say that bodybuilding saved my life. Muscle memory is real.\nIn April 2012, I got ill with pneumonia and was sick for the entire month. I had never been that sick, but it gave me plenty of time to think. I lost 15 pounds and my weight dropped to 200. I was determined to train hard when I became healthy to get my foot back in the fitness modeling door.  I linked up with Tad Inoue when I recovered and he led my nutrition plan in May 2012 and still currently does my nutrition. After working with him for several months, my body went to a new level.  I can't thank him enough and I've never learned so much information and knowledge on the correct ways to go about physique progression.","birthday":"11\/24\/1984","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":39508,"username":"tyler.mcpeak","website":"tylermcpeak.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"163846577059046","name":"Tyler McPeak","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tyler.mcpeak","likes":255684,"cover":{"cover_id":460202534090114,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1392829_460202534090114_985173749_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"This is the official fan page of Oakland Raiders running back Darren McFadden","bio":"     Darren McFadden, Running Back for the historic Oakland Raiders, has established himself as one of the top running backs in the National Football League. In addition to his success in the NFL, Darren had an extremely decorated collegiate career. In 2007, he earned the Walter Camp Award, the annual award given to the top player in college football. He was also a two time runner up for the Heisman Trophy in 2006 and 2007. While Darren has excelled in his professional career, he started from humble beginnings. \n\n     Darren was born in North Little Rock, Arkansas, a city located in Pulaski County which sits across the Arkansas River. Growing up in North Little Rock, Darren attended Oak Grove High School where he starred as prep athlete. He played multiple positions for his varsity football team but was primarily used as a running back on offense and a safety on defense. During his final season at Oak Grove, Darren was named to the Parade All American Team in 2004 along with Arkansas High School Player of the Year by Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Highly recruited by universities and colleges across the nation, several recruiting services recognized Darren's talents early on. He was named the 23rd best player in the nation by Rivals, which placed him with a 5-star rating. While Darren committed early to playing for his in-state school, University of Arkansas, many of the top SEC schools also recruited him heavily. These schools included the University of Tennessee, University of Alabama, and Auburn University. \n\n     Darren's impact for the Razorbacks was felt instantaneously. In his true freshman season, Darren finished the year with 1,113 yards rushing and 11 touchdowns on 176 attempts. Darren ended the season with the most yards a freshman running back had ever gained in an Arkansas uniform, and became only the seventh SEC player to rush over 1,000 yards as a freshman. He was recognized at the end of the season as SEC Freshman of the Year honors by both the SEC Media as well as SEC coaches. Darren also garnered Freshman All-American nods, and was named as Newcomer of the Year for the Southeastern Conference by ESPN.  \n\n     His sophomore season was no sophomore slump letdown. He finished the season with a school record 1,647 yards and 14 touchdowns. An interesting stat that he compiled was 3 passing touchdowns on just 9 pass attempts. He was honored with First Team All American honors for a record breaking season. On December 6, 2006, Darren was named as one of the 3 Heisman Trophy finalists along with Troy Smith and Brady Quinn. Darren also became the first ever sophomore to win the Doak Walker Award, the award given to the top running back in college football. \n\n     Before his junior season, Darren was already to be believed as a top draft selection for the 2008 NFL Draft. He was the frontrunner for many awards including the Doak Walker Award, the Maxwell, and the Walter Camp Player of the Year. His junior season only cemented such expectations. Darren finished the season with 1,830 yards and 16 touchdowns. He also contributed in the passing game with 21 receptions, showcasing his versatility. Once again, many fans expected Darren to win more awards after this season. He earned the Walter Camp Award and the Doak Walker Award again. Darren, in addition to Ricky Williams, is the second person to ever win the Walker Award twice in a collegiate career. He also finished as runner up to the Heisman Trophy for the second year in a row. This made Darren the first player since 1949 to finish second in consecutive Heisman voting. After his stellar junior season, Darren announced his intentions of entering the NFL Draft.\n\n     At the NFL Combine in Indianapolis on February 24, 2008, Darren ran an unofficial time of 4.27 seconds on the 40-yard dash, and an official time of 4.33, which was second among all running backs at the combine to only Chris Johnson, who ran a 4.24. After a strong collegiate career and Combine, Darren was selected 4th overall by the Oakland Raiders in the 2008 NFL Draft. \n\tAt training camp, Darren impressed Raiders coach Lane Kiffin with his ability to take instructions once and seamlessly incorporate them into his game. Media observers considered him the most complete Raiders rookie at this stage since Marcus Allen. Darren struggled early in his career with injuries but had a breakthrough 2010 season when he finished 1,157 yards and 7 touchdowns while rushing an average of 5.2 yards per carry. \n\n     At age 26 and already one of the top running backs in the NFL, Darren's ceiling is infinite. He continues to improve each season and has yet to enter the prime of his career.

He pursued a contract with the Chicago Cubs, whom he had followed since childhood, but despite Thome's offer to accept a less competitive contract, the organization declined.[citation needed] Instead, Thome accepted a six-year 85 million offer from the Philadelphia Phillies. The emergence of Ryan Howard made Thome expendable to the Phillies. On November 23, 2005, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox along with $22.0 million.

He was signed by the Texans as an undrafted free agent in 2009 and has since become one of the best RB in the NFL today!!\n\nFoster was born on August 24, 1986 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Carl Foster, a former wide receiver for the University of New Mexico, and Bernadette Sizemor, an administrative assistant for the university. Foster competed in football at Mission Bay Senior High School, where he was initially misplaced as a linebacker, but became a full-time running back in his senior year. He was Mission Bay's featured running back that year, and led San Diego County in all purpose yards with 2,500. Then-Tennessee offensive coordinator Randy Sanders and running backs coach Trooper Taylor were impressed by Foster when recruiting in San Diego. Foster chose to attend Tennessee and was part of the 2004 signing class. \n\nOn opening day of 2010, September 12, in Houston against the Indianapolis Colts, Foster broke many records, rushing 33 times for 231 yards and 3 touchdowns.\n\nFoster also posted the second-highest NFL opening day rushing total, trailing only O.J. Simpson's 250 yards in 1973. During week 4 on October 3 vs. the Oakland Raiders, Foster recorded the longest run in Texans franchise history when he scored on a 74 yard touchdown run in the 3rd quarter to break a 14-14 tie. Houston went on to win 31-24 behind Foster's 187 yards from scrimmage. \n\nFoster finished the 2010 season by winning the rushing title with 1,616 Rushing yards and 604 receiving yards breaking the record set by Priest Holmes for most yards from scrimmage ever by an undrafted player. He was invited to the 2011 Pro Bowl, which was his first Pro Bowl.  At the conclusion of the 2012 season, Foster was again selected as an All-Pro and voted to the Pro Bowl team.  \n\nIn 2013, Foster was featured on CBS's hit show, \"Hawaii Five-0\" and starred in the movie \"Draft Day\" alongside Kevin Costner.  \n\n","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Houston","state":"TX","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":1053,"username":"ArianFoster23","website":"www.arianfoster.org","were_here_count":0,"id":"201925469848483","name":"Arian Foster","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ArianFoster23","likes":192273,"cover":{"cover_id":612950595412633,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1384384_612950595412633_510842059_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The Fastest Man in the World has the records for the 100m (9.58) and 200m (19.19). He hails from Trelawny, Jamaica. ","affiliation":"Coached by Glen Mills (Racers Track Club)","bio":"www.usainbolt.com","birthday":"08\/21\/1986","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Kingston","state":"","country":"Jamaica","zip":""},"personal_info":"\"LIGHTNING BOLT\"\n\nWORLD'S FASTEST MAN !\n\n\nBolt was born to parents Wellesley and Jennifer, in Trelawny Parish, on the north coast of Jamaica. A rural area, known historically for its high number of sugar plantations and a large Maroon population, its more recent claim to fame is producing world-class athletes such as Veronica Campbell-Brown. What is so special about Trelawny? Wellesley Bolt puts it down to the distinctive yellow yams of the area that make up his son's breakfast, along with a starchy combo of dumplings and green banana. \n\nAfter competing for his parish of Trelawny at the annual national primary schools meeting, his coach convinced him to pursue track and field and that year he entered William Knibb High School.  It was here that Bolt was identified as a naturally gifted athlete. Dwight Barnett, one of Bolt's PE teachers, described the young Bolt's talent as head-scratching. 'Sometimes I'd look at that stop-watch and think, \"There's something wrong with this watch. No kid can run that quickly.\"'\n\nPablo McNeil, Bolt's first coach - a former Olympic sprinter - recalled the challenge of getting him on to the running track. 'The first time I saw Usain bowling I knew he was a born sprinter, he was so fast,' he said. 'But he was so cricket-mad that he took a bit of persuading. Initially he was quite hard to work with, he needed to be kept in line... nothing malicious, just pranks that got a bit out of hand, he certainly kept you on your toes.\n\n'I knew a long time that he was a cut above the rest. He's got an incredible stride, which just eats up the ground. I'm not in the least bit surprised at what he is achieving because I predicted five or six years ago that he was going to break world records. Anyone who saw him as a kid wouldn't have needed to be a prophet to tell you that.'\n\nAnybody who follows athletics in Jamaica watches the annual Champs - a high school athletics meet attended by 30,000 spectators, reported on in the island's news pages - the testing ground for future stars of track and field. The meet is so competitive it attracts a passionate and partisan crowd, each school has its own flag and there are often clashes between supporters. This is where many saw Bolt run for the first time. \n\n'I first saw Usain when he was 13 years old,' said Francis. 'A skinny, tall guy. But then he went to the final and didn't do much.' Did Francis pick him out as a future charge? 'Actually, I doubted whether he would make the transition. I figured he would be trying to go abroad. I figured he would be lost like so many others before him.'\n\nMore than 2,000 Jamaican athletes compete in the Champs each year, and many fall by the wayside.\nIt was not until his third year at high school, in 2001, that Bolt won his first medal at the annual high school championships, finishing second in 22.04. Fans in Barbados, host country of the Carifta Games - the Caribbean regional junior Championships - bore witness to his exciting potential as he took silver in a PB 48.28 for 400m and placed second in the 200 (21.81). Later that year he contested the 200m at the IAAF World Youth Championships. in Debrecen, Hungary, lowering his PB to 21.73, although he was eliminated in the semi-finals. \n\nThis Falmouth native blossomed in 2002. At 15, he took the 200\/400 double at the High School Championships, Carifta and the CAC Junior Championships, laying the foundation for a big run at the World Junior Championships in his home country, in Kingston. Along the way, the 6 foot-5 inch Bolt, towered over the competitors lowering his 200m personal best to 20.61. In the relays, he ran solid legs as a member of national record setting teams in the 4x100 and 4x400. \n\nBolt maintained his superb form in 2003, winning gold in the 200m at the IAAF World Youth Championships and Pan-Am Junior Championships (equalling the world junior record of 20.13). He was the star of the Jamaican High School Championships, rewriting the record books in the under-19 age group, with an easy 45.3 in the 400m, an 0.87 improvement on the previous record and 20.25 in the curved sprint, to lower the old mark by 0.57.\n\nBolt, the World Youth and World Junior 200m champion, then stood on the threshold of holding an unprecedented three IAAF world 200m titles simultaneously as he prepared for the World Championships in Paris. But conjunctivitis cut short his training 6 weeks beforehand and led to him being withdrawn.\n\nThe Bolt record rampage continued in 2004. Now a professional, he lowered the world junior 200m record of 20.13 seconds he shared with American Roy Martin, as he became the first junior athlete to break 20 seconds, with his Carifta Games winning time of 19.93 in Bermuda. \n\nIn 2004 Usain ran the 200 m in 19.93 seconds, becoming the first junior to break the 20-second mark and breaking Lorenzo Daniel's world junior record.\n\nLeg ailments destroyed the Olympic medal winning promise offered by the record run and Bolt was eliminated in the first round of the 200m at the Olympic Games in Athens.\n\nAt the 2007 Jamaican Championships, Bolt ran 19.75, breaking the 36 year-old national record held by Don Quarrie by 11 hundredths of a second. At the World Championships in Osaka, Bolt won a silver medal in the 200 m behind American Tyson Gay.\n\nBolt is highly rated by the IAAF and has received two IAAF Rising Star awards. The IAAF has described Bolt as \"the future of 200 m running\".\n\n\n\nPERSONAL BESTS:\n\nDate                  Event    Venue                                      Time \nAug 16, 2008   100 m    Beijing (National Stadium)         9.69\nAug 20, 2008   200 m    Beijing (National Stadium)        19.30\nMay 5, 2007     400 m    Kingston, Jamaica                    45.28 \n\n\nHeight: 195cm\n             6ft 5ins","personal_interests":"Dancing,\nMusic,\nCricket,\nBasketball,\nPhilanthropy\n\n\nBolt started running while in primary school, although his first love was cricket.

In spite of this, he scored 13 goals in La Liga and had the season's highest ratio of goals scored to number of minutes played. He returned to England the following season, joining Newcastle United for \u00a316 million. He had a promising start to the 2005\u201306 season but injuries largely ruled him out over the next 18 months. After his return he became team captain and was the team's top scorer for the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nInternationally, Owen first played for the senior England team in 1998, becoming England's youngest player and youngest goalscorer at the time. His performance at the 1998 World Cup brought him to national and international prominence and he went on to appear, and score, in Euro 2000, the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. He is the only player to ever have scored in four major tournaments for England. He played at the 2006 World Cup but suffered an injury which took him a year to recover from. Occasionally playing as captain, he is England's seventh most-capped player and has scored a national record of 26 competitive goals.","talking_about_count":1481,"username":"michaelowen","website":"http:\/\/www.michaelowen.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"79550427893","name":"Michael Owen","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/michaelowen","likes":629071}

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for Stone Cold Steve Austin.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Proudly raising his middle fingers in the faces of everyone who dared oppose him, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin was the blue-collar warrior for the common man. Clad in jeans and black leather often soaked in beer foam, Austin was defiant, brash and dared anyone to try and tell him what to do. When the signature sound of shattering glass erupted throughout the arena, everyone there knew that it was time to raise hell. And if you happened to be on the receiving end, well, you have our sympathies.\n\nTrained by \"Gentleman\" Chris Adams, Steve Austin broke into the wrestling business in Texas in 1990, as part of the USWA. After a year he moved on to WCW, where he won the WCW Television Championship under the name \"Stunning\" Steve Austin. An elbow injury lead to his firing from WCW, but Austin found a lifeboat in ECW, and, with the freedom afforded him by Paul Heyman, began crafting a voice that would later lead to superstardom in WWE.\n\nAustin joined WWE in January 1996 as Ted DiBiase's \"Million Dollar Champion.\" Debuting as \"The Ringmaster,\" he defeated Savio Vega in a forgettable WrestleMania contest. Soon after, \"Stone Cold\" was born.\n\nIn June 1996, The Texas Rattlesnake became King of the Ring, defeating Jake Roberts in the tournament final. To cap off the victory, \"Stone Cold\" delivered a riveting promo, pillorying Roberts and his religious beliefs, and heralding the birth of the \u201cAustin 3:16\u201d era. His words gave way to Austin's WWE destiny, ushering in the famed Attitude Era. This violent Superstar would stop at nothing until he reached WWE\u2019s top tier, and pummel anyone who dared cross his path.\n\nThe first Superstar to but heads with the new, meaner Austin was Bret Hart. Their rivalry reached its apex at WrestleMania 13, in a Submission Match. Austin was not the technical wunderkind that Hart was, but matched the mat general strike for strike in front of the Rosemont crowd. But the moment that separated Austin from his peers in the locker room came at the matches end. \"Stone Cold\" was nearly broken, trapped in Hart\u2019s Sharpshooter. But he refused to break the hold, and as seconds ticked into minutes, he still would not tap. Referee Ken Shamrock called the match as Austin passed out from the pain, with 18,000 people cheering the defeated Superstar.\n\nBut Austin\u2019s momentum, and WWE career, nearly halted in a freak injury at 1997\u2019s SummerSlam. During a match against Owen Hart, Austin was dropped on his head during a piledriver from Hart, fracturing his neck.\n\n\"Stone Cold\" ultimately recovered from the injury, and soon began his torrid rise to the top of the WWE heap. Austin\u2019s matches against Superstars such as Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels and the Undertaker, but he\u2019s best remembered for his battles against two men \u2014 The Rock, and the WWE Chairman himself, Mr. McMahon.\n\nThe latter rivalry began in late 1997, when Austin, furious at McMahon for stripping him of the Intercontinental Title, delivered a \"Stone Cold\" Stunner to his boss in front of the Madison Square Garden crowd. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time Mr. McMahon tasted Austin\u2019s leather boot, as the pair\u2019s hostile feud epitomized the Attitude Era.\n\nThe Rock and Austin criss-crossed just as often as Austin and Mr. McMahon. To put the rivalry in perspective, \"Stone Cold\" and the Rock, together, headlined three WrestleMania pay-per-views from 1993 to 2003, a feat no other Superstar has ever even come close to accomplishing. The two stars couldn\u2019t have been more different, but no two men were ever as popular at the same time as Austin and Rock.\n\nAustin retired from in-ring competition at the end of WrestleMania XIX, but continued to make memorable WWE appearances, usually at the expense of the McMahon. WWE crowds were never as long as when that glass shattered, and \"Stone Cold\" made his way to the ring, either in his leather boots, a Zamboni, or a beer truck.\n\nAt the end, his in-ring accomplishments were many: six WWE Championships, two Intercontinental Championships, a record three Royal Rumble victories and Triple Crown Champion credentials. His 2009 induction to the WWE Hall of Fame was a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d\n\nOutside the ring, he continued to thrive; he starred in WWE Studios The Condemned in 2007, and gone on to rub shoulders with some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest action stars, including Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, and recently, Danny Trejo. He also shined as host in the re-imagined series WWE Tough Enough, where his tirades toward contestants quickly became must-see television.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Stone Cold stats: \nHeight: 6 foot 2\nWeight: 252 pounds\nFrom: Victoria, Texas\nSignature Move: Stone Cold Stunner\nCareer Highlights: WWE Champion; Intercontinental Champion; World Tag Team Champion; King of the Ring (1996); Royal Rumble winner (1997, 1998, 2001); WCW U.S. Champion; WCW Tag Team Champion","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Victoria","state":"TX","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":36893,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars\/raw\/stonecold\/bio\/?cid=FSL","were_here_count":0,"id":"8021824641","name":"Stone Cold - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Stone-Cold-WWE-Universe\/8021824641","likes":3447905,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151963256504642","source":"http:\/\/sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/s720x720\/1385698_10151963256504642_247964887_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"THE BIGGEST UNOFFICIAL LUIS SUAREZ PAGE ON FACEBOOK!! Views and posts are not done so by Luis Suarez. ","awards":"Dutch footballer of the year 2010\nBest player of the 2011 Copa America\nTop scorer of the 2011 Copa America\nLiverpool top scorer 2012-13\nStandard Chartered Player Of The Season 2012-13","bio":"It would be fair to say that 2010 was the year that launched Luis Suarez into world superstardom, as well as global infamy. In fact, the year perfectly encapsulated the mix of attacking excellence and controversy that makes up one of Europe's most in-demand and talked-about forwards.\nAfter finishing the 2009-10 season with a remarkable tally of 49 goals in 48 games in all competitions for Ajax, winning the Dutch Cup in the process, Suarez travelled to South Africa to contest the World Cup finals. In the quarter-finals against Ghana, Suarez blocked a goal-bound effort in the final minute of extra-time, earning a red card and conceding a penalty in the process. However, Asamoah Gyan missed from 12 yards and Uruguay prevailed in the subsequent shoot-out, leading Suarez to be castigated by many for his dastardly role in the elimination of Africa's final competitors.\n\nHis magnetic attraction to negative PR was displayed once again in November 2010 when he was banned for seven games for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal. However, that incident should not cloud what has been a wildly successful career in De Eredivisie ever since his move from Nacional in 2006, when he left the Uruguayan club having won the league in his debut season in the first team.\n\nIt was Groningen who brought him to the Netherlands for around \u20ac800,000 and after scoring ten goals in 29 games in his first season in the country, Ajax paid \u20ac7.5 million to bring him to Amsterdam. Prior to the start of the 2010-11 season he had repaid them handsomely with 74 goals in 97 league appearances, leading to speculation regarding a move to one of Europe's bigger clubs, and specifically Liverpool; a club he eventually agreed to join in the January transfer window.\n\nStrengths: Technically excellent and with an unerring finish, this deadly striker is a threat from long range, in the box or in the air. He is also versatile and likes to attack from wide positions, making him an elusive presence.\n\nWeaknesses: Disciplinary issues have frequently threatened to undermine Suarez and biting aside, he has shown a worrying propensity to pick up yellow cards.\n\nCareer high: A controversial choice, perhaps, but Suarez made himself into a national hero when handballing to deny Ghana a last-gasp goal in the 2010 World Cup quarter-final. Though he became an international villain, Suarez was carried on the shoulders of his team-mates after their subsequent shoot-out victory in Johannesburg.\n\nCareer low: The forward was dubbed the \"Cannibal of Ajax\" by De Telegraaf and incurred a seven-game ban in November 2010 after biting Bakkal on the shoulder.\n\nStyle: Evasive, clever, deadly. A prolific forward.\n\nQuotes: \"The 'Hand Of God' now belongs to me. I did it so that my team-mates could win the penalty shoot-out. When I saw Gyan miss the penalty it was a great joy\". Luis Suarez, July 2010.\n\nTrivia: Suarez left his home town of Salto at the age of only 11 when moving around 500km to join the ranks of Montevideo-based club Nacional. \n","birthday":"01\/24\/1987","category":"Athlete","category_list":[{"id":"1600","name":"Athlete"}],"checkins":5,"is_published":true,"location":{"street":"Anfield ","city":"Liverpool","state":"","country":"United Kingdom","zip":"L4 0TH","latitude":53.427196402,"longitude":-2.95780337865},"personal_interests":"Football.

Her standout event of the season was in Rethymno, Greece, beating Priscilla Lopes-Schliep and Damu Cherry with a world-leading time of 12.47 seconds.\n\nAt the start of 2010 Lolo defended her 60m hurdles Indoor World Title in Doha after finishing with a time of 7.72 which was a new American record. She also picked up wins in Oslo, New York, Gateshead, and Monaco, and going into the last Diamond League race of the season, Lolo was tied at the top of the standings along side Canadian Priscilla Lopes-Schliep. Lopes-Schliep won the final race which left Lolo second in the overall Diamond league standings.\n\nLolo currently resides in Baton Rouge, LA and is sponsored by Asics and Oakley.  She's very involved in the community in Des Moines where she delivered a pair of new Asics running shoes for each member of her alma mater high school's track team. She also delivered a $3,000 check to buy indoor practice hurdles and for improvements to repair the school's track surface.\n\nIn July 2008, Jones donated her $4,000 prize she earned from winning the 100-meter hurdles at the Olympic trials to Renee Trout, a single mother from Cedar Rapids, Iowa who was hit by the Iowa flood of 2008. Asics and Oakley each matched Jones' $4,000 prize, bringing the total donation to $12,000. Afterwards, Jones flew with Trout to Cedar Rapids aboard a private jet provided by the Iowa Farm Bureau to tour the neighborhoods affected by the flood, including Trout's.","birthday":"08\/05\/1982","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":719,"username":"followlolo","website":"www.runlolorun.com www.twitter.com\/lolojones","were_here_count":0,"id":"167524409975898","name":"Lolo Jones","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/followlolo","likes":250939,"cover":{"cover_id":328053257256345,"source":"http:\/\/sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/s720x720\/528370_328053257256345_328797490_n.jpg","offset_y":36,"offset_x":0}}

All\u00ed inici\u00f3 su carrera futbol\u00edstica jugando en las divisiones inferiores del Club Atl\u00e9tico Talleres. Con apenas 17 a\u00f1os, debut\u00f3 en la Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Talleres el 29 de enero de 2007 y luego de tan solo 4 partidos, se incorpor\u00f3 a Hurac\u00e1n en julio de ese mismo a\u00f1o.\n\nHabiendo superado problemas en el tobillo que le impidieron sumarse al equipo con anterioridad, el 24 de mayo del 2008 hizo su debut oficial en Primera de Hurac\u00e1n. La presentaci\u00f3n fue a lo grande: en el Estadio Monumental ante River Plate, por el Torneo Clausura. Su carrera tom\u00f3 un vuelco cuando el entrenador \u00c1ngel Cappa decidi\u00f3 adoptarlo como titular con tan solo 19 a\u00f1os, en un gesto de reconocimiento al enorme talento de la joven promesa.\n\u201cJavier es un jugador exquisito, de los que no abundan. Desde que lo vi, supe que tendr\u00eda una carrera brillante por delante\u201d, recuerda el director t\u00e9cnico \u00c1ngel Cappa.\n\nHacia fines del 2008 y despu\u00e9s del inolvidable gol en la \u00faltima fecha del Torneo Apertura con V\u00e9lez (3 \u2013 0), los medios comenzaron a hablar del fen\u00f3meno Javier Pastore. R\u00e1pidamente impresion\u00f3 por su gran riqueza t\u00e9cnica adem\u00e1s de combinar una amplia visi\u00f3n de juego con mucha verticalidad. Su habilidad tambi\u00e9n la supo demostrar a trav\u00e9s de la facilidad para gambetear rivales y la velocidad con la pelota en su poder. Su particular estilo - similar por sus caracter\u00edsticas al de los mejores jugadores de las d\u00e9cadas de 1960 y 1970-  lo catapult\u00f3 como uno de los m\u00e1s promisorios exponentes del medio futbol\u00edstico argentino.Con su magia y regularidad contribuy\u00f3 en forma decisiva a la excelente y sorpresiva campa\u00f1a del equipo de Hurac\u00e1n en el Clausura 2009. En ese torneo mostr\u00f3 un gran rendimiento tanto a nivel colectivo como individual, donde convirti\u00f3 goles importantes ante River, Rosario Central, Lan\u00fas, Racing. Eso le permiti\u00f3 al club de Parque Patricios disputar el liderazgo con V\u00e9lez Sarsfield hasta la \u00faltima fecha del campeonato. Su nivel de juego provoc\u00f3 que surgieran ofertas de clubes como Manchester United y Palermo para obtener sus servicios.\n\nFinalmente, en julio del 2009 se concret\u00f3 su pase al Palermo de Italia con un contrato hasta el 2014.\n\nEl \"Flaco\u201d supo adecuarse a una nueva forma t\u00e1ctica y no tard\u00f3 en sentirse c\u00f3modo con el estilo de juego del equipo Siciliano. En la Serie A del Calcio le demostr\u00f3 al p\u00fablico italiano su gran capacidad como volante ofensivo, ganando un lugar en sus corazones. Sus destrezas con la pelota despertaron el inter\u00e9s de otros grandes clubes de Europa: Real Madrid, Manchester City, Inter de Mil\u00e1n, Chelsea FC, AC Milan y Barcelona.\n\nSu primer partido en la Selecci\u00f3n Nacional fue contra el combinado de Catalunya el 15 de diciembre de 2009, en Barcelona. Dentro de la primera convocatoria nacional tambi\u00e9n convirti\u00f3 su primer tanto, con un verdadero golazo desde afuera del \u00e1rea. Pero su debut oficial en el conjunto que por aqu\u00e9l entonces dirig\u00eda Diego Armando Maradona, fue en el Mundial de Sud\u00e1frica 2010. All\u00ed ingres\u00f3 por Sergio Ag\u00fcero en la victoria por 2 a 0 contra Grecia, siendo el \u00faltimo partido de la primera fase del Grupo B. A su vez ingres\u00f3 en el triunfo ante M\u00e9xico por los cuartos de final y tambi\u00e9n en la eliminaci\u00f3n ante Alemania por los cuartos de final.\n\nA pesar de ser calificado entre los mejores jugadores del mundo a sus escasos 21 a\u00f1os y llamar la atenci\u00f3n de las potencias futbol\u00edsticas en Europa, contin\u00fao en el Palermo. Una vez finalizado el Mundial, Javier comenz\u00f3 a ser noticia constantemente por llamar el inter\u00e9s los clubes grandes del Viejo Continente. \n\nEn Palermo fue vital, desempe\u00f1andose como una de las piezas claves para finalizar quintos en la temporada y clasificar a la UEFA Europa League. Entre sus mejores actuaciones se destacan un partidazo ante Juventus, un hat trick contra Catania y un gol ante Bologna (mostrando en el festejo una remera con dedicatoria para las madres argentinas, justamente en su d\u00eda).\n\nEn octubre de 2010 fue seleccionado por la FIFA como uno de los mejores talentos de Italia y un mes despu\u00e9s, Sergio Batista lo convoc\u00f3 para el cl\u00e1sico amistoso de Argentina - Brasil. Luego de ese encuentro, fue tentado por un jeque \u00e1rabe para quedarse a jugar en Qatar. En enero del 2011 recibi\u00f3 el premio \"Oscar del Calcio\" al mejor jugador joven de la temporada, donde adem\u00e1s, lo destacaron como la mejor promesa a futuro.  \n\nUnos meses m\u00e1s tarde, fue citado para enfrentar a Estados Unidos y a Costa Rica en dos partidos amistosos de la Selecci\u00f3n Argentina. Form\u00f3 parte del plantel nacional que disput\u00f3 la Copa Am\u00e9rica 2011 como local, donde recibi\u00f3 muy buenas cr\u00edticas por su papel dentro del plantel que dirig\u00eda Sergio Batista. Fue ovacionado dentro del Estadio Mario Alberto Kempes, donde tuvo su ansiado retorno a C\u00f3rdoba, ingresando en el segundo tiempo en la victoria por 3 a 0 ante Costa Rica.\n\nEn Agosto de 2011, Javier Pastore fue transferido al Paris Saint Germain de Francia. Su pase r\u00e9cord se convirti\u00f3 en el m\u00e1s alto de la historia de la Ligue 1.\n\nR\u00e1pidamente, Javier se acopl\u00f3 al equipo m\u00e1s popular de Par\u00eds. Su debut oficial lo hizo el 18 de agosto de 2011 ante Differdange, por la UEFA Europa League. Luego de sorprender en sus primeras actuaciones, fue elegido como el mejor jugador del mes en PSG. El \"Flaco\" convirti\u00f3 su primer gol en la victoria ante Brest por 1 a 0, el 11 de octubre. Un a\u00f1o m\u00e1s tarde, m\u00e1s precisamente el 18 de septiembre, har\u00eda su presentaci\u00f3n en el certamen m\u00e1s importante de Europa: la UEFA Champions League. En aqu\u00e9l primer choque ante Dynamo Kiev, por la fase de grupos, tambi\u00e9n se dio el lujo de marcar el primer tanto.\n\nEn 2013 finalmente llegaron los t\u00edtulos tan esperados. El 12 de mayo PSG gan\u00f3 su tercera Ligue 1, con Javier Pastore como una de sus principales figuras. Su papel en el equipo de Carlo Ancelotti fue tan importante, que los hinchas lo ubicaron dentro del podio al mejor jugador del torneo. Par\u00eds explot\u00f3 de felicidad y sus fan\u00e1ticos colmaron las calles para festejar, ya que hace 19 a\u00f1os que el club no obten\u00eda la liga francesa. Previo al \u00e9xito en el campeonato local, los parisinos hab\u00edan quedado eliminados a \u00faltimo momento, en los cuartos de final de la Champions ante el Barcelona. Sin embargo, tuvieron una gran actuaci\u00f3n en el certamen y en el plano invidivual Pastore logr\u00f3 un nivel superlativo (incluso marcando un gol en el Camp Nou).\n\nEl cordob\u00e9s comenz\u00f3 la temporada 2013 - 2014 de la mejor manera: El 3 de agosto se consagr\u00f3 campe\u00f3n de la Supercopa de Francia (m\u00e1s conocida como el Trofeo de Campeones) ante el Bourdeaux.

He broke the previous record (held by Vince Taylor at 22 wins) in Moscow on November 5, 2004.\n\nColeman graduated cum laude from Grambling State University (GSU) in 1986 with a B.S degree in accounting[citation needed]. While attending Grambling State University Coleman also played football as a middle linebacker with the GSU Tigers under famous coach Eddie Robinson. After graduation, Coleman became a police officer.\n\nBeing a police officer allowed Coleman the free time he needed to work out. Coleman's fellow officer suggested he attend a gym known as Metroflex. The owner of the gym was Brian Dobson, who happen to also be an amateur bodybuilder, offered Coleman a free lifetime membership to Metroflex if he would allow him to train Coleman for the upcoming Mr. Texas bodybuilding competition that year.\n\nAfter the training for the upcoming event of Mr. Texas, Coleman won first place in both the heavy weight and overall categories. He also defeated the man that trained him, Dobson. Also in 1990 not only did Coleman take the title of Mr. Texas but he also took titles in that years National Physique Committee (NPC) Texas Championships. In 1991 Coleman also won what is probably considered one of the most prestigious competitions in amateur bodybuilding, Mr. Universe. This victory qualified him to enter the professional contest sponsored by the IFBB, the sport's largest sanctioning body.\n\nColeman won his first competition as a professional\u2014the Canada Pro Cup in 1995. The following year he won the contest again. Followed by a first place win in 1997, The Russian Grand Prix.\n\nColeman's success as a professional bodybuilder has led to many product endorsements and other opportunities in his career. Due to his bodybuilding profession Coleman undergoes a lot of travel to places such as China, Brazil, and Australia. Coleman also makes many guest appearances at gym openings all around the U.S.\n\nColeman has also made some training videos. His first Training Video; The Unbelievable; The cost of Redemption; and On the Road. In these videos Coleman gives tips for more experienced weightlifters, while warning against over exertion and improper form.\n\nWhen working out, Coleman prefers to use free weights rather than machines in order to maximize his flexibility and range of motion. He lifts weights six days per week.\n\nColeman supports the Inner City Games, an organization that California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger co-founded in 1991. He was the recipient of the 2001 Admiral in the Texas Navy Certificate Award from Texas Governor Rick Perry for outstanding achievements in bodybuilding and for the promotion of physical fitness.\n\nOn June 30, 2009 on MuscleSport Radio, Coleman stated that he would compete in the 2010 Mr. Olympia competition.[citation needed] Coleman also indicated that he would not participate in the 2009 Mr. Olympia competition for lack of preparation time. On October 10, 2009 at the Northern Territory Fitness & Bodybuilding Titles in Darwin, Australia, Coleman confirmed that he would compete in the 2010 Mr. Olympia competition, however, he did not appear at the 2010 Mr. Olympia competition.\n","birthday":"05\/13\/1964","category":"Athlete","category_list":[{"id":"1600","name":"Athlete"}],"is_published":true,"location":{"street":"706 Gentry Drive","city":"Arlington","state":"TX","country":"United States","zip":"76018","latitude":32.654709,"longitude":-97.101669},"personal_info":"Is the man many consider the greatest champion in bodybuilding history making a historic comeback? \nBy: Roger Lockridge \n\nThe Return of Ronnie?\n8 Times he has held the Mr. Olympia title; tied for the most of all time. 26 times he has claimed victory in the IFBB; the most of any bodybuilder ever. Many consider him the Michael Jordan of bodybuilding. When Ronnie Coleman stepped offstage for the last time in the fall of 2007 at the Olympia, it was the end of an era of dominance that we may never see again. \n\nBut like the end of many great athletes' runs, many have speculated whether Ronnie will come back. Each year since his 4th place finish at the '07 Olympia, there have been rumors that he was coming back. The King would return to claim his throne. It's understandable because even though he has never competed since, Ronnie has been as close to the sport as ever. \n\nWhether it was his guest posing around the world, his appearances at all the major expos, his contributions most recently to Muscular Development Magazine, working on plans for the \"Ronnie Coleman Signature Series\" line of supplement products, or using his celebrity status to give back via his charity \"Free the World From Hunger\", Coleman has maintained his position as an ambassador and representative of bodybuilding because he knows that bodybuilding has given him so much and he wants to give back as much as he can. \n\nHe knows it, you know it, we all know it.\nWhen it comes to bodybuilding, Ronnie Coleman is the greatest.\n\nIs 2011 The Year It Happens?\nThose rumors have never been stronger than this year when Dan Solomon, Chad Nicholls, and Lee Thompson brought the subject up on Pro Bodybuilding Weekly when they announced that both Brian Dobson, owner of the world renowned Metroflex gym in Arlington, TX where Ronnie trains, and the promoter of the IFBB Masters World Championships in Miami announced that this was the year Coleman was coming back. \n\nSo is true? Will the man many consider the best ever make a triumphant return and prove that even as he enters his late 40's he still has what it takes to stand among the best? Bodybuilding.com chatted with the legend himself to find out the latest on what could be history in the making.  \n\nBodybuilding.com: You haven't been onstage since the '07 Olympia but rumors have been circulating for a long time that you were going to come back at some point. Did you think that was the last time you competed or did you know that you would make a comeback?\nRonnie Coleman: I always knew that I would make a comeback at some point. I didn't know when but I knew it would eventually happen. \n\nBBcom: Is this the year we will see you back in a pair of posing trunks?\nRC: Well to be honest I don't know if I am going to now or not. I knew I would comeback at some point because I want to prove to myself that I can still do it. If I do this it will be for me to prove to myself that I can still get onstage and bring a winning physique. \n\nBBcom: What is going to help you make the decision to return to an IFBB stage this year?\nRC: I don't know how well known it is but I had back surgery in '07 and it took about two years to recover. I just now feel comfortable enough to do it. It is different for me to prepare now because back when I competed I didn't travel or anything. I prepared and that was it. After this surgery, for a while I didn't even leave the house. \n\nI have a gym at home so if I felt good enough to work out I did it there. I am feeling good now but it's more of a mental game for me now. I need to make sure my head is right and I'm not going to worry about getting injured. Now that I'm older it's a head game to see if I want to put myself through all the work it takes to get ready for a show. \n\nAs I said earlier, if I do this it will be for me to prove I can do it. Before, I didn't have that issue because I competed for sponsors and other reasons. This will be all about challenging me if I do the show in December. We'll have to wait and see. \n\nBBcom: So all of the talks about coming back are a little premature. Is that what you are saying?\nRC: At this point, yeah it is. My back is coming along pretty good compared to where it was. I couldn't even take five steps before without hurting. Now I can walk a mile no problem. You know what I mean? \n\nBBcom: So if you decide you are mentally ready to prepare for the Masters World Championships, will it be more difficult for you to prepare since you haven't done it in a few years, or will it be like riding a bike so to speak?\nRC: Oh if I decide I am going to do it then the prep work will be nothing new for me and I will be able to do it without any problem. I may not be as strong as I used to be but I am still pretty strong and I know I can handle what I have to do in the gym to be ready to step onstage in Miami. The preparations don't bother me a bit. It's just a matter of deciding if I'm clear in my mind that I want to do it. \n\nAlso if I do it then it'll be different because this is for me and not for endorsements or anything like that. I'm not even with BSN anymore so this will be all about me and if I can still do it. A lot of the guys in that show are older and past their prime and are probably doing it to see if they can do it too. \n\nBbcom: You mentioned the work in the gym. Now that you are a few years older, will the training remain the same as it did when you were Mr. Olympia or will you change up what you do to get ready for the show?\nRC: Training will be a little different. I'm 46 now, will be 47 when the show comes around, so I'm not going to be as strong as I was when I was Mr. Olympia. What I used to call \"light weight\" will probably feel heavier. (He laughs) I won't be able to handle all the weight like I did when I filmed the videos and did all the other things I did back a few years ago. \n\nI have to make adjustments and train a little differently, but I will still give all the effort I did back then. That part of it will never change. I still believe in training heavy and hard. It's just I can't go as heavy as I did back then. \n\nBBcom: When you competed there weren't too many flaws with your physique. Now will you focus on improving any part in particular or will you just focus on bringing the best you've got?\nRC: Yeah I'm past the point now of worrying about weak points. I'm just going to focus on bringing the best I've got to the stage and that's it. Back then, whatever was considered weak on my body I would take time to improve. Nowadays I don't worry about things like that. \n\nBBcom: Will anyone be helping you get ready for the show or will you do the prep on your own?\nRC: Again that's something I haven't given much thought to and probably won't until I decide if I'm going to do the show or not. I have a lot of experience getting ready for shows so I may end up doing my own prep work, but we'll have to wait and see before I can answer that conclusively. \n\nBBcom: Have you given any thought to who else is in the lineup or are you just worrying about you?\nRC: I talked to the promoter and there were actually 12 guys invited. Dexter Jackson, former Mr. Olympia is doing it. Toney Freeman, who placed high at the Olympia is doing it. Samir Bannout who was dominant in his day ('83 Mr. Olympia), Chris Cormier, who always placed high in shows is doing it. \n\nIt's a good list of guys but some of them are older; even older than me. They're good though because I don't know if I could do it at their age. You can't blame them for doing it though because this show is invitation only and the purse is the 3rd highest on the entire circuit.\n\nBBcom: So when do you think you will make the ultimate decision to grace a bodybuilding stage with your presence?\nRC: I don't know when I will make the decision. I couldn't set a date, but when I do I will let everyone know. I would like to do it, and if my head is in it then it will be on for sure. \n\n\n","talking_about_count":6319,"username":"8xmisterO","website":"www.ronniecoleman.net","were_here_count":0,"id":"122788722443","name":"ronnie coleman","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/8xmisterO","likes":852288,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151844694982444","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash4\/s720x720\/1452539_10151844694982444_1142845091_n.jpg","offset_y":50,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Love him or hate him, The WWE Chairman is the mastermind behind the entertainment juggernaut known around the globe for its unparalleled form of competition and showmanship: World Wrestling Entertainment.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"He\u2019s the boss, big cheese, head honcho, high muck-a-muck, top dog, man upstairs, taskmaster, ringleader and kingpin all rolled into one. Since purchasing Capitol Wrestling Co. from his father in 1982, The Chairman has built his empire ruthlessly and efficiently, dispatching all who stand in the way of his entertainment sovereignty \u2014 from Ted Turner and WCW to HBK and God.\n\nDuring the \u201980s, Mr. McMahon transformed WWE from a regionally-run business into a national juggernaut, bringing wrestling into the mainstream and pioneering the use of pay-per-views in the process. In the \u201990s, he launched the ever-popular Attitude Era, highlighted by his rivalry with \u201cStone Cold\u201d Steve Austin. By 2001, he purchased rival WCW. And ever since, he\u2019s entertained the WWE Universe in more ways that can be counted, clashing with D-Generation X, Randy Orton, Bret Hart, Hulk Hogan, Donald Trump and even his own children, Shane and Stephanie.\n\nMcMahon\u2019s been blown up, buried beneath an exploding stage, shaved bald and fingered as Hornswoggle\u2019s illegitimate father. He\u2019s given away millions of his own money, locked lips with Rikishi\u2019s posterior and withstood the pain of being relieved of his day-to-day duties by his own son-in-law, Triple H and WWE\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2012, Mr. McMahon endeared himself to the WWE Universe with a series of crowd-pleasing power plays. He removed the unpopular John Laurinaitis from the post of Raw and SmackDown General Manager and he tried tirelessly to beat respect into irreverent then\u2013WWE Champion CM Punk. Calling out Punk\u2019s right-hand man, Paul Heyman, for apparently maintaining a secretive affiliation with the destructive Shield spelled trouble for Mr. McMahon. Just as it looked like the WWE Chairman was going to terminate Heyman, Brock Lesnar made an unannounced return to WWE in stunning fashion, by F-5\u2019ing Mr. McMahon! The vicious attack broke the WWE Chairman\u2019s left hip, forcing him to undergo hip replacement surgery days later.\n\nValiantly, Mr. McMahon returned mere weeks after surgery to challenge Heyman to a fight.

This former World Champion has once again revolutionized his career with TNA.\n\nJeff Hardy is best known for his work in tables, ladders and chairs matches where he regularly pushed the limits of professional wrestling. Fans are truly amazed by his undying resilience and commitment to his craft. Hardy famously competed in the second Monster\u2019s Ball match in history. During this match, at Bound for Glory 2005, Hardy performed his notorious Swanton. From the top of the arena entrance, Hardy landed onto Abyss, who was lying on a table 30 feet below. This was just a testament to Hardy\u2019s dangerous style offense and disregard for his own personal safety.\n\nAt Lockdown 2013, Hardy lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Bully Ray, who then announced himself as president of the villainous biker gang Aces & Eights.\n\n\u2022    Professional wrestling icon \n\u2022    One of the most popular pro wrestlers of all time \n\u2022    Married with a daughter \n\u2022    Former multi-time World Heavyweight Champion \n\u2022    Artist (painter) \n\u2022    Loves motocross \n\u2022    Member of the band Peroxwhy?gen\n","birthday":"08\/31\/1977","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":" Jeff Hardy On Twitter : http:\/\/twitter.com\/jeffhardybrand","talking_about_count":56261,"username":"Jeff.Hardy.76","website":" Jeff Hardy Official Web Site : http:\/\/www.thematthardyshow.com\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"180593411306","name":"Jeff Hardy - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Jeff.Hardy.76","likes":1025009,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151096317741307","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/76100_10151096317741307_617006381_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Some crack under the weight of newly heightened expectations.  Some put it on cruise control and coast along from past achievements in a fulfilled state of satisfaction.  It is a rare individual who rides the momentum of success towards bigger and better things in life.  Professional skateboarder Chris Cole, through his continual domination of competitions, has clearly earned himself the top spot amongst the elite of skateboarding.  Through it all, Chris has been grounded with the realization that life is all about deep-seated relationships fostered through respect and compassion.  As his profile ascended, he furthered his desire to perpetually self evaluate and improve all facets of life.  His forthright interactions with those in and out of the industry made a direct and positive impact on the image and character of skateboarding.  It was an image that at times took hits for being overrun with punk kids running amuck and creating havoc on public property.  As the spotlight's glow on Chris began to brighten, so did the viability and credibility of skateboarding as a whole.  It was rapidly becoming the fastest growing sport in America.  Chris wanted the world to see that skateboarding breeds individuals that are athletic, creative, and driven.  Rather than succumbing to the trappings of the \"live fast and die young\" mentality, Chris adopted his own credo of \"live rad and die proud\".  It is a concise and powerful statement that has guided him personally and throughout his professional career.  A career that was first set into motion at the ripe old age of 14.\n\nAt a time in life when most kids are figuring out what video game to play next, Chris had made the determination that he would forgo college and make his way in life by skateboarding full-time.  Chris was raised in Levittown, PA outside of Philadelphia.  He holds the Northeast corridor and the makeup of it\u2019s people near and dear to his heart.  He likens their notorious rudeness to a hardened exterior shell.  Once penetrated, the shell makes way for deeper and much more meaningful connections.  While in the Philadelphia area, Chris entered into local and regional skateboarding contests starting in his pre-teen years.  He won them early and he won them often.  He quickly established himself as an elite talent and landed corporate sponsorships by the age of 16.  From there, it was like a jet fueled propulsion with only momentary stops to collect a trophy or receive an award.  Chris credits the development of his riding style to his willingness to shred and skate all physical obstacles that present themselves in the realm of street skating.  He never wanted to be limited to just being great on ledges or handrails.  He wanted to crush gaps, ramps, and anything and everything there was to conquer.  It was this approach to street skating that garnered him a string of accolades, yet to cease or slow from being bestowed upon him.  He has received honors from the industry and direct praise from the fans like Transworld Skateboarding\u2019s \"Readers Choice Award\". He has the rarified distinction of being only one of two skaters twice named Thrasher Magazine\u2019s \u201cSkater of the Year\u201d (2005 & 2009). The Dew Tour, Maloof Money Cup, and Battle of the Berrics 2 are just a partial listing of contests he wrapped up for victory.  There was also the back to back gold medals won in consecutive years at the X Games, ESPN's elite action sports event.  The multitude of victories and mounting press coverage of Chris swung the door of opportunity wide open for him.  He became a featured rider in the smash hit video games \"Skate\" and \"Skate 2\" while also making numerous appearances in videos such as \"Bam Margera: CKY2K\".  While the physical expressions that Chris was able to display on a board clearly played a major role in all these triumphs, he attributes the success to something much simpler than that - Fun.  If Chris is not having fun, then he is not winning contests.  The foundation of his career advancement has been the passion and pure joy he has in his soul for skateboarding.  It is a wholehearted desire for riding and competing that words on a page fall short of describing.  It is the kind of infatuation that can make a 14 year old boy be acutely aware that instead of college, his future belongs thrashing through history.  \n\nChris indeed has made his mark on the history of skateboarding.  The countless victories and abundance of awards prove it.  Even though Chris is grateful for all he has attained throughout his career, he believes that leaving a legacy has nothing to do with hardware or bountiful prize purses.

{"about":"3X WWE Diva's Champion, performer, spokeswoman and instructor for the Gracie Women Empowered Self-Defense program, world traveler, and hard workin' woman!","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Eve discovered her passion for athletics and performing at a young age through competitive gymnastics, and dance. Heavily influenced by the discipline and work ethic of her parents, she was an exceptional student in high school, and made achieving a higher education her main priority. After graduating with honors from the University of Southern California with a degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering, she was determined to revive her spirit for performing and competition. Following a year of dancing for the Los Angeles Clippers' Spirit, she decided to bring her passion to the grandest sports entertainment stage of them all. Eve entered the 2007 World Wrestling Entertainment Diva Search, a fan-vote-based competition to seek out the next WWE Diva. Her beauty, intelligence, athleticism, and charisma took the WWE Universe by storm and resulted in her winning the competition. \n\nIn just two years with the WWE, Eve worked her way from interviewing superstars backstage, to becoming the first ever Diva Search winner to win a championship title. She is now a 3 time Divas Champion and a strong face of the Divas division.  Eve is not only known for her work in the ring, she also is a proud spokeswoman for the company. During the 7-Eleven WWE SummerSlam 2010 promotion, her face was featured on Big Gulp cups throughout the nation. She also proudly supports the National Guard through the Big Guns Campaign. \n\nEve is the winner of NBC primetime reality show Stars Earn Stripes (Mark Burnett, Dick Wolf, David Hurwitz), where 8 celebrities were paired with elite Military and Law Enforcement \u201coperatives\u201d to compete in action packed military missions using live weapons and explosives. Eve was paired with Green Beret Grady Powell, and together they made the fastest time in every mission they completed!  Eve participated in this competition as a way to honor the sacrifices that our service men and women continue to make, and earned a total of $150,000 for the USO.\n\nBesides her weekly role on Monday Night Raw (USA) and Friday Night SmackDown (SyFy), she has been featured on show's such as Deal or No Deal, Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed, Sunset Tan, Best Damn Sports Show Period, Good Day LA, and many others. Along with her appearance in the monthly WWE Magazine, she has also appeared in Cosmopolitan, Muscle & Fitness, Latina magazine, Best Body Fitness, Linda Novia as a cover model, Maxim Philippines, and on the cover of Muscle & Performance. \n\nEve is proud to live a healthy, drug and alcohol free lifestyle. She is always seeking new methods to achieve optimum physical fitness and health, and has a passion for sharing her ways with others. Her favorite way to keep mentally and physically sharp is with Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.  She is a spokeswoman and head instructor for the Gracie Women Empowered self-defense program. Having had the opportunity to teach women all over the world, from college students to the women in the U.S. Armed Forces, Eve has found her deepest passion to be empowering women to overcome their self-imposed limitations.\n\nMost importantly, Eve is a strong advocate for giving back to the community. Much of her time is dedicated to the Get R.EA.L. program, in which she encourages and inspires kids of all ages to live healthily and to develop the work ethic necessary to follow through with their educational goals. She's heavily involved in the Wrestlemania Reading Challenge, and every year she volunteers for \"Tribute to the Troops,\" a live special performance and morale visit for the U.S. troops overseas.

Sen can play almost any way he wants. He has incredible aggressive play, amazing macro and some brilliant tactical play. He can overwhelm opponents with units, play low-tech with constant aggression or use strong timing attacks and harass to whittle down his enemies. Sen is the complete package and a very hard player to predict.\n\nBiography\n\nSen formerly played Brood War as Taiwan's top player. He played for a long time and was a strong figure in the foreign scene for a long time. After taking a hiatus, Sen returned to competitive play and competed in the 2009 Pokerstrategy.com TSL where he eventually took third place after defeating IefNaij in the third-place match 3-2. During end of May and beginning of June of 2011, Blizzard invited several reporters and well known players including Sen[1] to collect feedback on a prototype of Blizzard's upcoming expansion StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm.\n\nWings of Liberty\n\nSen participated in the MLG Dallas 2010 Pro Circuit National Championships where he was knocked to the losers bracket halfway through by the eventual tournament runner-up TT1, and then lost shortly after to Socke[2].\n\n\n\nSen playing in GSL Season 3.\nSen qualified with the likes of 4 other foreigners to play in the round of 64 for the 2010 Sony Ericsson Starcraft II Open Season 3. After some excellent defensive play in the round of 64 against oGsVines he then went on to face GSL Season 2 champion NesTea and lost 0-2. Although reaching the Round of 32 would allow Sen to be eligible to compete for a Code A position in 2011, he would decline. Sen would make a return to the Korea by competing for a spot in the 2011 GSL World Championship where he would take down xiaOt 2-1 in the preliminaries. He would ultimately lose to Marineking in the bracket stage.\n\nSen would be seeded into the TeamLiquid StarLeague 3 where he defeated Fenix but lost to Boxer, 2-3 in the following round. Sen was accepted to take part in the debut season of the NASL.\n\nNASL Season 1\nSen showed an impressive run through the first season of the NASL, emerging with a total score of 7-2, taking decisive victories over IdrA, Zenio, Tyler, PainUser, MaNa, Drewbie and Socke, but losing to both Boxer and Cloud.[1][2].\n\nIn the Season 1 Finals he beat Zenio again 2-1 utilizing heavy roach play -- Sen would be the first foreigner to defeat a Korean in the finals, upsetting the dominance of the Korean players thus far. Advancing to the round of eight, Sen overcame fellow zerg player DarKFoRcE 2-1. He advanced to play against MC as the last foreigner player, but lost in an extremely close five sets with a score of 2-3. He then defeated July 3-1 to take third place.\n\nSen has announced that he will take part in the Taiwan eSports League when his contract with Fnatic expires in August[3].","birthday":"01\/15\/1987","category":"Athlete","description":"For those who are interested in making any donations please send your funds via paypal \n\nemail : hulanehk\u0040163.com\nname: Julie Chen \nAny donations to support my gaming career would be truly appreciated.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Raw and WWE NXT Slammy Award-winning broadcaster Michael Cole","affiliation":"WWE ","bio":"The self-proclaimed \u201cVoice of WWE\u201d and \u201cfuture WWE Hall of Famer\u201d Michael Cole is the play-by-play announcer for Monday Night Raw and a color commentator on Friday Night SmackDown. Though he has been a fixture on WWE TV since mid-1997, only in 2010 did the WWE Universe realize exactly how loathsome Cole can be.\n\nBefore joining the wild world of WWE, Cole was a standout in the field of broadcast journalism, working for CBS radio and building a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 one wouldn\u2019t expect of an announcer who currently causes his broadcast colleagues and WWE fans to stock up on headache remedies.\n\nWhile working for CBS Radio in 1993, Cole covered the entire 51-day standoff at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. In 1994, he traveled to Sarajevo for what was supposed to be a six-week assignment covering the siege of the city by Serbian forces. The assignment turned into a nine-month, life-changing experience that saw him report daily from a war-torn city, ducking snipers and mortar shells at every turn. His documentary, \"Voices of Bosnia,\" was critically acclaimed and won several major awards. With experience in reporting the most tragic of events, Cole was dispatched to Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995 to cover the horrific bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.\n\nCole also covered three United States Presidential elections; in 1988 with Michael Dukakis, 1992 with Bill Clinton, and 1996 with Steve Forbes and then Bob Dole. One year after his final stretch of election coverage, Cole entered sports-entertainment.\n\nIn 1997, Cole brought his talents to WWE and sat alongside a litany of broadcast partners that include Jim Cornette, Tazz, John \u201cBradshaw\u201d Layfield, Jim Ross, Kevin Kelly, Jerry \u201cThe King\u201d Lawler, Jonathan Coachman, Mick Foley, Matt Striker, Todd Grisham, Josh Mathews and Booker T.\n\nHowever, in early 2010, the largely objective former journalist slowly showed signs of negative outspokenness while calling WWE NXT. The interviewer who once entertained the WWE Universe by receiving a wedgie by DX and getting humiliated by The Rock in verbal tirades slowly said and did things to make him more reviled by WWE fans.\n\nInsulting the likes of Jim Ross and former Divas Champion Eve, Cole\u2019s incendiary comments and aggressive support of The Miz got the announcer out from under the headset and into a bright orange singlet on The Grandest Stage of Them All.\n\nAt WrestleMania XXVII, Cole faced Raw announce team colleague Jerry Lawler with \u201cStone Cold\u201d Steve Austin was signed as special guest referee. It simply wasn\u2019t pretty but not just because of Cole\u2019s ludicrous ring wear. The Voice of WWE took a much needed beating in front of millions but left with a highly debatable victory by disqualification \u2013 a fact Cole is quick to recall on air almost weekly on Raw.\n\nIn the months that followed, Cole tasted \u201cde-feet\u201d in the form of a Kiss My Foot Match he lost to Lawler and the contemptible commentator ultimately apologized to both The King and the rest of the WWE Universe for his actions. This hasn\u2019t stopped Cole from offending and irritating viewers with his one-sided brand of broadcast journalism. The multiple-time Slammy Award winner\u2019s subjective commentary still remains reason for WWE fans to cherish the \u201cmute\u201d button on the TV remotes.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Amenia","state":"NY","country":"United States","zip":""},"personal_info":"Michael Cole and WWE Hall of Famer Jerry \u201cThe King\u201d Lawler make up the lead broadcasting team on Monday Night Raw, calling the action on USA Network and WWE pay-per-view events.\n\nPrior to switching announce booths with Jim Ross and heading to Raw in the 2008 WWE Draft, Cole was the lead announcer on SmackDown since the brand\u2019s inception, working with partners ranging from Tazz to JBL to Mick Foley.\n\nFor nearly a decade, Cole has worked hard to vividly describe all of the action World Wrestling Entertainment has to offer, and has earned him as much praise in WWE as he earned in the news world.\n\nWhile working for CBS Radio in 1993, Cole covered the entire 51-day standoff at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas that led to tragedy when more than 80 residents of the compound perished in a fire that erupted during a shootout between them and federal agents.\n\nClick here to find out more!\nIn 1994, he traveled to Sarajevo for what was supposed to be a six-week assignment covering the siege of the city by Serbian forces.

In his early days, he hosted the syndicated Livewire show, as well as Shotgun Saturday Night with Jim Cornette. By the end of that year, he was an announcer on Raw. From 1997 to 1999 he held regular stints as a Raw announcer, and when SmackDown made its debut in 1999, Cole was chosen for the lead play-by-play announcing role. Originally teamed up with Jerry Lawler, Cole was paired with Tazz in 2001 and the two were together for five years until his realignment with ECW in June 2006. After that, Cole found himself sitting beside then-retired JBL, Jonathan Coachman and later the Hardcore Legend himself, Mick Foley, until Cole was ultimately drafted to Monday Night Raw.\n\nIn his tenure behind the broadcast booth, Cole has sometimes found himself in the thick of the action. While some of his assignments are enviable (such as emceeing a Divas Bikini Contest, for instance), he has also found himself as the object of several SmackDown Superstars\u2019 ire. Regardless, his talent for calling the turbulent and unpredictable action of WWE has made him one of the top all-time announcers.\n","talking_about_count":10041,"username":"WWEMichaelCole","website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"118277891560596","name":"Michael Cole - WWE","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/WWEMichaelCole","likes":333976,"cover":{"cover_id":345495655505484,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/545005_345495655505484_1301368991_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

He also participated in Gymnastics from ages 6-10.\n\nAaron began training with weights for no apparent reason in 1998. After numerous injuries, he began spending less time running track and playing football and more time in the school gymnasium. \n\nAdding more muscle to his little frame with each passing year, he no longer excelled in the sports he was most genetically gifted at (middle distance running\/cross country\/football) and moved more towards the throwing events to make the school track and field team.\n\nIn late 2002 Aaron fell out of a tree (yes srs) and tore a chunk of cartilage off the bottom of his femur, also tearing his medial ligament in the process. This forced Aaron to be far more inactive (cardio wise) than he was used to and he started spending even more time in the gym. After waiting around 12 months, he underwent a cartilage graft, which involved removing some of his own cartilage cells, culturing them up in the hospital and then later grafting the cartilage back into the injured knee. The recovery process meant spending 3 months on crutches whilst the graft hardened and set into place, during which time he hired a wheelchair and spend most of his spare time 'tricking' in the chair and seeing how fast it could go down his street. Six months post op, he started rehabbing the knee in the gym with very light bodyweight movements, extensions and curls. Twelve months post op, his knee was 100\u0025 and his legs were starting to take shape. \n\nStarting up a muck-around basketball team with some friends around 2004, who's uniform included rather tight singlets and short shorts (they were actually underwearz) he tried to get back into competitive sports, athletics\/football\/basketball.\n\nStruggling to be as competetive as he once was, he was plagued by soft tissue injuries and was becoming more and more frustrated.\n\nAfter tearing his hamstring for the 1647th time (not quite srs) running a 400m race in early 2008, he decided to hang up his spikes\/football boots and focus solely on becoming a competitive bodybuilder. \n\nHe had been eating\/training like a bodybuilder since 2003, so the lifestyle was there already. He thought he would give in to the constant pressure from others and may as well compete in a bodybuilding show and see how he faired.\n\nThe 2008 season went well and although overdieting left him flat and a little smaller than what he should have been, he won the INBA Mr Novice Australia title.\n\nHaving to sit out the 2009 bodybuilding season after tearing his medial ligament, vastus medialis, and adductor magnus, whilst participating in a wrestling\/rugby match during a \u2018foam party\u2019 at a nightclub in Indonesia (also srs), he focussed on the 2010 season.\n\n2010 was a very interesting year for Aaron Curtis. After having focussed on winning the state \u2018intermediate\u2019 title for the past 2 years, Aaron found himself winning the ANB state overall title and coming a close 2nd in the INBA state titles. He then went on to get a close 2nd yet again at the INBA nationals titles and came home from the 2010 ANB Australian Championships as  the overall national champion, I title he had never dreamed of winning in 2010, as he believed he was 5-10 years of training, away from such a title.\n\nAround 2 weeks after nationals, Aaron became aware of many athletes testing positive to methylhexaneamine due to use of many popular bodybuilding pre workout supplements. Methylhexaneamine is a dietry supplement which is legal for use \u2018out of competition\u2019 periods but is prohibited  \u2018in competition\u2019 periods. Aaron had been using the product \u2018jack3d\u2019 around the time of his comps and realised that he would soon be receiving a letter from ASADA\/WADA informing him of his positive test\/s. \n\nAaron was later banned from all ASADA\/WADA sanctioned sports for 2 years and stripped of his ANB national U90kgs and overall title and also his INBA state and national intermediate titles. He still holds the 2010 ANB Mr Victoria overall state title, as he did not test positive in that competition.\n\nAaron is now training hard during his forced offseason, focussing on being the biggest and best bodybuilder he can be, when he next gets up on stage.\n\nAaron is a lifetime natural athlete, with no use of any pro hormones, anabolic steroids, growth hormones or peptides. At this stage of his life he has no desire to \u2018enhance\u2019 and make the transition across to the \u2018untested\u2019 competitions.\n\nDuring his ban from natural competition, Aaron got up on stage in the NABBA and IFBB wirth the BIG BOYS! Still competing as natural athlete, not be taking any substances that are prohibited within the natural bodybuilding federations that he usually competes in, Aaron still managed to win his classes in both federations at the state championships. Having not expected to do very well in the untested federations, Aaron had not planned to go on to the national titles in either federation and had already booked a holiday to Indonesia post comp.\n\nIn early 2013 Aaron decided to compete in an IFBB mens physique competition at FitX, in offseason condition, as a joke. After being advised not to do so by his sponsors, Aaron decided he would still do the show, but had to crash diet for 4 weeks to try and get in shape. Aaron got back down to around 10\u0025 body fat for the show and thought he looked OK, but the judges thought otherwise and he placed dead last! Lolol.\n\nToo big for mens physique.\n\nAaron is currently preparing for the 2013 INBA and ANB state\/national bodybuilding shows, where he hopes to qualify for the Natural Olympia, held in San Diego, this November.\n\nWith the sole goal of becoming the best natural bodybuilder that he can be, Aaron puts very little emphasis on how he looks\/places compared to any other athlete. He focuses on bettering his past performances in regards to size\/symmetry\/proportion and definition of his own physique. For Aaron, bodybuilding competition is a way of measuring his own personal progress, not about winning titles or trophies. \n\n\u2018Get massive.\u2019 \u2013 Aaron Curtis =]\n","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"Australia Mate","zip":""},"personal_info":"5'11\" 189lbs (on stage), 225lbs (offseason).","personal_interests":"Eating, sleeping, training, surfing, watching sports, enjoying the suns warmth... and sleeping more.","talking_about_count":12395,"username":"skinnyaaroncurtis","website":"\u003C\u003Cnot-applicable>>","were_here_count":0,"id":"250000031724735","name":"Aaron Curtis","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/skinnyaaroncurtis","likes":276032,"cover":{"cover_id":584122984979103,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/542241_584122984979103_2091134811_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Shawn Michaels.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Ask any Superstar on the WWE roster who the most gifted sports-entertainer of all time is and nearly everyone will have the same answer \u2014 Shawn Michaels.\n\nA cocky, confident heartbreaker from San Antonio, Texas, HBK started off his career as one-half of The Rockers and ended it in a classic match with The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXVI. Along the way, he won every major WWE title, two Royal Rumbles, entry into the WWE Hall of Fame and a reputation as The Icon, The Showstopper, The Main Event.\n\nHis days in the ring weren\u2019t always glorious, though. After charming crowds as a Rocker in the \u201990s, HBK infamously severed his partnership with Marty Jannety by smashing his friend\u2019s head through a window. And the notorious \u201cMontreal Screwjob\u201d of the 1997 Survivor Series involving his greatest rival, Bret \u201cHit Man\u201d Hart, could have killed a lesser Superstar\u2019s career. Instead, it only added to the allure of one of sports-entertainment\u2019s most captivatingly flawed figures. \n\nA rebel in leather chaps, Michaels bucked authority and surrounded himself with people who did the same. As the troublemaker behind DX, HBK made life a living hell for the McMahon family alongside his longtime running buddy Triple H. As a member of The Kliq, he did the same for the WWE locker room, carefully wielding his considerable influence to get the best treatment for himself and friends like Kevin Nash and Scott Hall.\n\nThe self-proclaimed \u201cSexy Boy\u201d could be an unrepentant primadonna, but he was so fluid and brilliant in the ring that it hardly mattered. His Ladder Match with Razor Ramon at WrestleMania X established his reputation for having the best bout on The Grandest Stage of Them All \u2014 a tradition he\u2019d continue in classics against Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho and The Undertaker.\n\nHBK\u2019s thrilling run was nearly brought to an early end when a back injury put him out for more than four years. In that time, he fell in love, had children, found religion. When he finally returned, Michaels displayed none of the flaws that plague many Superstars in their final years in the ring. Instead, The Icon continued to have career-defining matches right up until his last stand against The Phenom at WrestleMania XXVI. \n\nAlthough it was one of the final times WWE fans would hear the crack of Sweet Chin Music, audiences did not mourn HBK\u2019s retirement. Instead, they celebrated it, grateful to have witnessed the evolution of Shawn Michaels from high-flying Rocker to sports-entertainment immortal.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Shawn Michaels stats:\nHeight: 6 foot 1\nWeight: 225 pounds\nFrom: San Antonio, Texas\nSignature Move: Sweet Chin Music \nCareer Highlights: WWE Champion; World Heavyweight Champion; Royal Rumble winner (1995 & 1996); Intercontinental Champion; World Tag Team Champion; European Champion\nAssociates: Triple H\nTrained By: Jose Lothario","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"San Antonio","state":"TX","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":53146,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars\/raw\/shawnmichaels\/bio\/?cid=FSL","were_here_count":0,"id":"9752007795","name":"Shawn Michaels - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Shawn-Michaels-WWE-Universe\/9752007795","likes":4520050,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152430154897796","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1426702_10152430154897796_654404008_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Christian.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Christian\u2019s been proving his worth in WWE from day one. In his first official bout in 1998 as a member of The Brood, the Toronto native set the bar rather high for himself by winning the Light Heavyweight Championship from Taka Michinoku. And he\u2019s raised it every year since.\n\nChristian\u2019s knack for wowing the WWE Universe, by executing innovative and high-impact maneuvers, has cemented his rep as a top-tier Superstar and led to some pretty epic victories alongside lifelong friend Edge during the TLC mayhem of the Attitude Era. Together, the duo laid claim to seven stunning World Tag Team Championships and engineered some of WWE's most memorably absurd moments, including their infamous \"five-second pose.\" They also pioneered the dreaded Con-Chair-To, a sadistic double-team strike in which both Canucks simultaneously whacked an adversary with a folding chair. This obsession with steel objects reached frenzied heights at WrestleMania 2000, where Edge & Christian, the Hardy Boyz and the Dudleys introduced the world to the first-ever Tables, Ladders and Chairs Match.\n\n\u201cCaptain Charisma\u201d eventually broke out on his own, birthing a pack of followers known as \u201cPeeps\u201d and winning numerous titles such as the prestigious Intercontinental Championship. In 2009, after taking a four-year sabbatical from WWE, he returned to his hardcore roots to notch the ECW Championship\u2014twice in one year.\n\nPerhaps none of his achievements, though, are as extraordinary as his victory in a brutal Ladder Match against Alberto Del Rio at Extreme Rules 2011, where Christian captured his first World Heavyweight Championship. He held the illustrious title for five days before seeing his reign ended prematurely by Randy Orton.\n\nThe loss narrowed Christian\u2019s focus on regaining the World Heavyweight Title by any means necessary, even if it meant constant pleas for \u201cone more match\u201d to prove his mettle. He kicked off his second reign with a victory over The Viper at Money in the Bank 2011, only to have Orton reclaim the title one month later at SummerSlam 2011. The charismatic competitor then struggled to regain his form and finally saw his year end due to injury.\n\nUpon realizing the honor of inducting his longtime friend and former partner, Edge, into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2012, Christian confessed to experiencing a \u201cmoment of clarity\u201d that reset his own career goals. He returned from injury at WWE Over the Limit 2012 and won a Battle Royal and a match with Cody Rhodes to claim the Intercontinental Championship for the fourth time. Though his reign ended on Raw 1,000, Christian looks ready to compete with the tenacity and charisma that the WWE Universe has come to expect from the Canadian Superstar.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Toronto","state":"ON","country":"Canada","zip":""},"talking_about_count":19788,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars\/smackdown\/christian","were_here_count":0,"id":"63590429032","name":"Christian - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Christian-WWE-Universe\/63590429032","likes":1181293,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151673740689033","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1238900_10151673740689033_379264857_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

The most popular luchador in Mexico became a welcome and huge acquisition by WWE, and debuted on Monday Night Raw the night after WrestleMania XXVII, April 4, 2011.\n\nA second-generation performer, Sin Cara (whose name literally means \u201cwithout face\u201d) began in Mexico at the tender age of 15 and has never looked back. With his roots firmly bedded in the art of lucha libre, he exudes charisma, agility and a deep love and loyalty for his Mexican heritage. In WWE, the soaring Superstar birthed a new legacy, wowing viewers around the world with spectacular displays of agility and airborne attacks.\n\nSince returning from an injury he suffered at the 2011 Survivor Series, Sin Cara has risen to a new level. And during a fierce rivalry with Cody Rhodes, the competitor found a new ally in fellow masked warrior, Rey Mysterio. When Intercontinental Champion The Miz got caught up in their ongoing clash, it caused a chain reaction of events that led to a whirlwind Fatal 4-Way Intercontinental Title Match at Night of Champions.\n\nAfter nearly walking away with the championship gold in that high-octane showdown, Sin Cara continued to work together with Mysterio in what WWE Hall of Famer Jim Ross referred to as a \"teacher-student\" relationship, showcased their dazzling lucha libre ability in incredible fashion.\n\nWhether in single of tag team action, the gravity-defying Superstar is a true force to be reckoned with.

He proved everyone wrong, though, by winning the United States Championship, the Unified Tag Team Championship and several high-profile matches.\n\nThen in July 2010, Miz\u2019s career hit a turning point. By winning the Raw Money in the Bank Ladder Match, the Ohio native guaranteed himself a chance to capture his ultimate goal \u2014 the WWE Championship. And on the Nov. 22, 2010, edition of Monday Night Raw, The Miz finally made good on his persistent threats, successfully cashing in his WWE Title opportunity on a vulnerable Randy Orton to capture the most illustrious prize in sports-entertainment.\n\nFollowing the win, The Miz went on a blistering championship reign, backing up every caustic proclamation of his awesomeness by holding onto the title for an astounding 160 days. After losing the title to John Cena at Extreme Rules, The Awesome One continued to hover around the main event scene before aligning himself with R-Truth, who shared Miz\u2019s beliefs that the powers that be in WWE were conspiring to keep them down.\n\nTheir affiliation was short-lived, which, honestly, is the best thing for The Miz. He does better on his own, when he doesn\u2019t have to share the spotlight \u2026 or the mic. The Awesome One proved that on the historic 1,000th episode of Raw when he won the Intercontinental Championship by defeating Christian.\n\nAfter that victory made him a WWE Triple Crown Champion, The Miz would premiere his own talk show, \u201cMiz TV,\u201d which he dubbed \u201cThe Most Must-See Talk Show in WWE History.\u201d With guests including such icons as SmackDown General Manager Booker T and World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus, the boisterous Superstar relished having his own pulpit with which to proclaim his own awesomeness. \u201cMiz TV,\u201d even attracted the attention of Peabody Award\u2013winning journalist Larry King, who in turn interviewed The Awesome One on Raw.\n\nIn 2013, The Miz brought his desire to entertain to the set of \u201cThe Marine 3: Homefront,\u201d starring in the latest installment of WWE Studios\u2019 explosive action movie series. At WrestleMania 29, he dethroned Wade Barrett to capture the Intercontinental Title in an Interactive Pre-Show Match. (EXCLUSIVE MIZ INTERVIEW) The following night on Raw, though, The Miz lost the title to Barrett in a vicious rematch.\n\nWhile his most recent Intercontinental Title reign lasted a little more than 24 hours, The Miz certainly won't let that bring down The Awesome One.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Kane.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"If it seems improbable for hellfire and brimstone to be so utterly chilling, you haven\u2019t met Kane. At 7-feet tall and weighing in at more than 300 pounds, The Devil\u2019s Favorite Demon is a monstrous abomination that seems to have been extracted directly from your childhood nightmares.\n\nThe Big Red Monster has tormented WWE since his debut at Badd Blood in October 1997, when he tore off the cage door and unleashed hell during the first-ever Hell in a Cell Match between Shawn Michaels and his half-brother The Undertaker.\n\nKane is consumed by an infernal desire to set ablaze the lives of his fellow Superstars, leaving a scorched path of destruction behind his fiery footsteps. Some of The Big Red Monster\u2019s more demented acts have included setting a WWE Hall of Famer on fire, hitting a WWE executive with a Tombstone, kidnapping too many Superstars to mention and forcing a WWE Diva to marry him. No one is safe from his twisted desires and demonic impulses. Least of all, it would seem, Kane himself.\n\nFor years, the sadistic Superstar wore a ghoulish face mask designed to conceal hideous burns from a fire supposedly started by Undertaker years before. But WWE fans received a shock on one of the most infamous nights of Kane\u2019s career when,\u00ad after losing a Mask vs. Championship Match on Raw, the tortured soul was forced to unmask and reveal his face to the world.\n\nKane\u2019s career has been marked by some stellar and brutally woeful contests in the ring against some of the biggest names in WWE, including The Undertaker, \u201cStone Cold\u201d Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Edge and others. He\u2019s also pioneered some of the most vicious stipulations of all time, including First Blood, Inferno, Stretcher and even Till Death Do Us Part Matches.\n\nLike his sibling, Kane wields a highly decorated mantle of WWE glory, including reigns as WWE Champion, World Heavyweight Champion and ECW Champion. He has shown near-unprecedented versatility in the tag team ranks as well, finding championship success with a litany of partners such as X-Pac, Big Show and even twice with The Deadman. Most notably, the famed Brothers of Destruction simultaneously held the World Tag Team Championships and WCW Tag Team Championships during the Alliance\u2019s Invasion.\n\nHidden beneath a mask in his earliest WWE haunts, Kane reverted to concealing his face under a scarlet leather shroud in late 2011, and it wasn't long before The Big Red Monster set his demonic sights on Daniel Bryan. Although the submission specialist got the best of his newfound rival at SummerSlam, he may have awakened a more uncontrollable fire in The Devil\u2019s Favorite Demon, provoking him to attack Josh Mathews and Zack Ryder in incidents that inevitably led The Big Red Monster to the last place anybody expected: anger management. \n\nBy order of Raw General Manager AJ Lee, The Devil\u2019s Favorite Demon joined Bryan in anger management classes, and it\u2019s safe to say progress was slow at first. Though Kane opened up about his tormented life during the first session, he still had a long way to go to reach inner peace, as he viciously chokeslammed David Otunga on Raw. Things were looking up for The Big Red Monster after his second week of therapy, when he and Bryan shared a friendly (albeit reluctant) embrace when the WWE Universe voted for them to \u201chug it out\u201d on Monday Night Raw. A few shoves later, however, and the pair had to be pulled apart by WWE officials before they did any major damage.\n\nIn a bold experiment, Kane and Bryan\u2019s counselor, Dr. Shelby, next forced these unhinged Superstars to join forces as a tag team. Oddly enough, this tactic proved effective when the tumultuous team became the WWE Tag Team Champions at Night of Champions 2012. The following night on Raw, Kane & Bryan again overcame their issues \u2014 and their opponents \u2014 to defend their championship gold for the first time as a tandem that would come to be known as Team Hell No. While a tournament was arranged to determine the No. 1 contenders to their titles, Team Hell No achieved their greatest victory on the Oct. 1 episode of Raw when they defeated WWE Champion CM Punk & Dolph Ziggler. Less than a month later, Cody Rhodes & Damien Sandow, aka Team Rhodes Scholars, became the new No. 1 contenders, punching their ticket to face Team Hell No at Hell in a Cell. Discord cost the champions the match but not the titles, as they fell to Team Rhodes Scholars via disqualification.\n\nThe team\u2019s infighting again proved to be its downfall at Survivor Series when an argument between the pair led to Kane\u2019s elimination from the Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Tag Team Match. Kane & Bryan soon found themselves united in the face of a common enemy, however, when Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns (The Shield) invaded WWE and attacked the pair on multiple occasions. Fate later afforded Team Hell No an opportunity to face their tormentors when WWE Champion CM Punk\u2019s knee surgery forced him out of his WWE Title defense at WWE TLC 2012. Unfortunately, fate also led Kane to be planted through a ringside barrier by Roman Reigns as the NXT invaders clinched an unlikely victory at the December pay-per-view.\n\nThe year 2013 kicked off on a positive note, however, as Kane and Bryan's newfound cameraderie led them to pass their four-month follow-up with Dr. Shelby on the Jan. 14 Raw. Ironically enough, however, the good doctor himself lost his temper following an insult by Team Rhodes Scholars. The next week, Kane and Bryan officially graduated Shelby's program, initiating a mass hug between the Superstars, Shelby, Jerry Lawler, Michael Cole, Dr. Sampson, Justin Roberts and the entire WWE Universe.\n\nTeam Hell No followed up the good feelings with a successful title defense over Team Rhodes Scholars at the Royal Rumble, but weren\u2019t on the same page later that night in the Royal Rumble Match. After Bryan eliminated his own partner, the smaller of the champions found himself knocked out of the ring and into Kane\u2019s arms. The Big Red Monster, left with the decision of dropping his pal or placing him back in the bout, decided on the former. The fickle friends butted heads again in February when they fought each other for a spell during an Elimination Chamber Match to determine the No. 1 Contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, though they were both eliminated by Mark Henry and seemingly had mended fences by the March 4 edition of Raw.\n\nLater that week, however, tragedy struck Kane when his father, Paul Bearer, passed away. And when CM Punk disrespected the memory of The Father of Destruction on the March 11 Raw, Kane took it upon himself to honor his father by defeating Punk in a brutal No Disqualification Match with aid from The Undertaker. The victory was ultimately marred when Punk attacked Kane with Bearer's sacred urn and absconded with it as Raw went off the air. Kane's frustration spilled over into the next week, although fate happily presented him an outlet for his anger: A tag title defense against Dolph Ziggler & Big E Langston at WrestleMania 29. \n\nThat outlet turned out to be just what The Big Red Monster needed. Despite the constant meddling of their ex-flame AJ Lee, Kane and Daniel Bryan persevered against The Showoff and his muscle, retaining their titles. The next night, they united with The Undertaker to drive back The Shield from a potential attack on The Phenom, but the \"Hounds of Justice\" retaliated two weeks later with a victory over Kane, Bryan and The Undertaker in London.\n\nStill very much in tune with his twisted dark side, Kane can still lock the WWE Universe in the grip of his grim black glove and leave the landscape of sports-entertainment in ember-laden ash, and woe be to the Superstar who forgets it.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Kane stats:\nHeight: 7 foot\nWeight: 326 pounds\nSignature Move: Chokeslam\nCareer Highlights: WWE Champion; Intercontinental Champion; World Tag Team Champion; WCW Tag Team Champion; Hardcore Champion\n","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":41398,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"10270726229","name":"Kane - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Kane-WWE-Universe\/10270726229","likes":4079172,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151612852611230","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1236197_10151612852611230_1684651947_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Known for his Zen-like flow both on land and in the water, Machado was consistently seeded at the top of the rankings as a competitor on the ASP World Tour. His world-title-deciding heat at Pipeline against close friend Kelly Slater in 1995 remains perhaps the most dramatic \u2013 and uplifting \u2013 showdowns in competitive surfing history. With 12 career WCT victories, Machado was ranked among the top ten surfers for eleven straight years and was inducted into the Surfers Hall of Fame in 2000 and re-inducted in 2006.\n\n       But his contribution to the sport doesn\u2019t end with his accolades in a colored jersey. Since his departure from the ASP tour in 2001, Machado has been one of surfing\u2019s most committed ambassadors, roaming the globe, surfing the world\u2019s best waves and broadening the definition of high-performance surfing. From reinventing tube riding in the depths of Indo to blowing minds on the finless, wooden planks known as alaias, Machado is often seen as a modern-day Gerry Lopez: A true embodiment of style and aloha. \n\n       Rob\u2019s \u2018style\u2019 when he is not surfing is another admirable quality, as seen in his commitment to supporting various charitable causes. Rob has established The Rob Machado Foundation, which through his annual golf tournament supports various charities dedicated to environmental programs within Southern California. His foundation also works closely with the Cardiff Education Foundation on efforts to green Machado\u2019s hometown\u2019s elementary school district. He has also created the Rob Machado Surf Experience, a highly anticipated surf contest for girls and boys 16 and under in Rob\u2019s hometown of Cardiff-by-the Sea, California.\n\nRob\u2019s goodwill does not stop on the local-level, as this surf legend has also donated his time for an Indonesian well digging project with the Sumba Foundation, and for the Water Innovation Now (WIN) contest, which gave 500,000 kids the opportunity to come up with innovative ways to conserve our water as a result of Southern California\u2019s water crisis.\n\n       All of this \u2013 along with his down-to-earth, approachable aura \u2013 makes Machado one of surfing\u2019s most influential athletes of all time.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Chris Jericho.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"There is one thing you can say about Chris Jericho \u2014 the guy knows how to make an entrance.\n\nDuring the summer of 1999, a millennium clock began counting down on Raw. WWE fans spent weeks wondering what the timer was leading to before getting an answer on Aug. 9 when the clock struck zero and Y2J appeared. Audaciously interrupting The Rock, the confident new competitor immediately announced himself as a performer who wasn\u2019t afraid to make a statement.\n\nSome people would crack under the hype of such a big debut. Jericho exceeded it. Over the next decade, The Ayatollah of Rock 'n' Rolla grabbed a record nine Intercontinental Titles, multiple Slammy Awards and the distinction of being the first Undisputed Champion in WWE history \u2014 an achievement he never fails to mention.\n\nSon of former NHL standout Ted Irvine, Jericho was born in Manhasset, N.Y., but raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. A wrestling fan from an early age, he trained in the famed Hart Family Dungeon and made his ring debut against Lance Storm when he was only 19. Starting out in the frigid armories of Canada, Jericho went on to perform across the globe in places like Mexico and Japan, infusing different international styles into his repertoire along the way. By the time he reached WCW in 1996, his loyal band of \u201cJerichoholics\u201d was growing rapidly.\n\nThe cocky competitor found success in WCW, winning the Cruiserweight and Television Titles on multiple occasions, but he soon grew frustrated with the locker room politicking that plagued the company. Sensing a brighter future in WWE, Jericho broke the walls down on Raw with a thrilling debut in 1999.\n\nHis place in WWE history was cemented on Dec. 9, 2001 at Vengeance, when he beat The Rock for the WCW Championship and \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin for the WWE Championship on the same night, unifying both titles to become the first-ever Undisputed WWE Champion.\n\nMore big matches followed, but Jericho was forced out of WWE in August 2005 after losing a \u201cYou're Fired!\u201d Match to then-WWE Champion John Cena on Raw. During that two-year hiatus, Jericho pursued acting, toured with his heavy metal band Fozzy and penned the story of his career, \u201cA Lion's Tale: Around the World in Spandex.\u201d\n\nAfter a lengthy 2007 video campaign that foretold of a Superstar that would \u201cSave Us,\u201d Jericho came back again with a chip on his shoulder. Upset at WWE brass for passing him over for World Title opportunities, he went so far as to call his treatment a \"conspiracy.\" But while his attitude changed, his ability didn\u2019t. He won the World Heavyweight Championship for the third time at No Way Out in 2010 and enjoyed successful tag team runs with Edge and Big Show.\n\nJericho disappeared from WWE rings again after being punted in the head by Randy Orton, but he made a fiery return to Raw in January 2012. Following weeks of cryptic vignettes that warned, \u201cThe end begins on 1-2-12,\u201d the man who calls himself \u201cThe Best in the World at What He Does\u201d appeared out of the darkness in a jacket made of lights and bucked expectations by energetically running around the ring for 10 minutes, but never speaking a word. WWE fans didn\u2019t know quite what to make of Y2J\u2019s behavior, but Chris Jericho is nothing if not unpredictable. \n\nY2J eventually revealed that he returned to vanquish WWE of Superstars he believed to be ripping him off, namely CM Punk, who had taken to calling himself \"The Best in the World.\" Jericho's attack on Punk was extremely personal, taking shots at the WWE Champion's family. Y2J tried to wrest the belt away from Punk at WrestleMania XXVIII and in a Chicago Street Fight at Extreme Rules, but came up short. Undeterred by his losses to The Straight Edge Superstar, Jericho rebounded to notch the biggest victory of his WWE comeback when he showed up The Showoff, Dolph Ziggler, at SummerSlam in front of a sold-out STAPLES Center crowd.\n\nJericho's resurgence was short-lived, however, as he agreed to put his WWE contract on the line against Ziggler for The Showoff's Money in the Bank contract the very next night on Raw. The Mental Mastermind's decision wound up costing him dearly, with a hard-fought defeat to Ziggler putting an end to Jericho's seven-month run of 2012.\n\nBut as quickly as Jericho departed, he broke the walls down once again. To the shock of the Phoenix crowd, Y2J entered as the No. 2 entrant in the 2013 Royal Rumble Match. Standing face to face with No. 1 entrant Ziggler, Jericho and his longtime foe battled deep into the 30-man classic with the Fozzy frontman eventually being eliminated by Ziggler.\n\nFollowing his return at Royal Rumble, Jericho crossed paths with dancing Superstar Fandango \u2014 who refuses to step inside the ring until his name is pronounced correctly (it\u2019s FAHN-DAHN-GO). Y2J humorously mangled the pronunciation, resulting in an attack by Fandango that Jericho later reciprocated. As a result, WWE's first-ever Undisputed Champion took on the dancing competitor at WrestleMania 29.\n\nIn their Show of Shows tango, it was Fandango who shocked the WWE Universe by defeating the six-time World Champion in his very first competitve match. Jericho, a ring veteran, told WWE.com that the ball was now in his extravagant opponent's court, that it was up to him to run with it.\n\nIn the weeks following The Show of Shows, it became clear that the animosity between Y2J and Fandango was far from settled. In a battle against World Heavyweight Champion Dolph Ziggler on Raw, Jericho was distracted by the dancing Superstar's music and Ziggler capitalized for the win. Later that same evening, Jericho retaliated by tossing his nemesis off the entrance stage and relived his days on \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d by tangoing with Fandango\u2019s dance partner.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Chris Jericho stats\nHeight: 6 foot\nWeight: 231 pounds\nFrom: Manhasset, N.Y.\nSignature Move: The Codebreaker; The Walls of Jericho; Lionsault\nCareer Highlights: WWE Championship; WCW Championship; Intercontinental Championship; European Championship; Hardcore Championship; World Tag Team Championship; ECW TV Championship; WCW TV Championship; WCW Cruiserweight Championship\n","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Winnipeg","state":"MB","country":"Canada","zip":""},"talking_about_count":24071,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars\/smackdown\/chrisjericho\/bio\/?cid=FSL","were_here_count":0,"id":"8122075826","name":"Chris Jericho - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Chris-Jericho-WWE-Universe\/8122075826","likes":1391139,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151875778315827","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/537202_10151875778315827_635760439_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

","affiliation":"Philadelphia Phillies","birthday":"12\/17\/1978","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","country":"United States","zip":""},"personal_info":"Chase Utley was born on December 17, 1978, in Pasadena, CA. He was a tremendous baseball player growing up, spending countless hours playing wiffleball to perfect his swing. Chase played his high school baseball at Long Beach Poly High School, and was able to stay close to home when he was offered a scholarship to play for UCLA. In 2000, Utley burst onto the national scene when he was named Outstanding Player of the NCAA Regionals.\n\nAfter that season Chase was selected in the first round (15th overall) by the Philadelphia Phillies and began his journey through the minors. Chase worked his way all the way up through the Phillies farm system, with stints with the Batavia Muckdogs (A-Short Season) in 2000, the Clearwater Phillies (A) in 2001, and the Scranton\/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons (AAA) in 2002-03. In 2003, Chase split time between AAA and the majors but performed well when he got his shot in the big show. He recorded his first hit, a grand-slam, in his first big league start, and by the end of the season Utley was a regular in the Phillies line up.\n\n2006 was a break-out year for Chase Utley. He began the season playing in the inaugural World Baseball Classic, as the starting second baseman for Team USA. While the team didn\u2019t capture the gold, Utley got the year off to a good start by hitting .385 during the tournament. Chase carried that momentum into the 2006 season where he had a career year. During 2006 he hit .309, drove in over 100 runs, stole 15 bases, and hit 32 home runs, numbers that were good enough to make him the starting second baseman during the all-star game. Utley also grabbed national headlines during his 35-game hitting streak, the second longest in Phillies\u2019 history. His stellar play during the middle of the season was enough to make him the National League\u2019s Player of the Month for July.\n\nThe Phillies weren\u2019t able to make the playoffs in 2006, but that didn\u2019t end the year for Utley. He was selected for an all-star squad that traveled to Japan to play in a series against an all-star team made up of Japanese players. The American squad led by Utley and his Philadelphia teammate Ryan Howard swept the Japanese squad, capping a fantastic 2006 for Chase.\nIn 2007, Chase began the season on a roll and was selected by fans to be the starting second basemen in the 2007 MLB All-Star Game, his second such honor. After missing part of the season due to a broken bone in his hand, Chase returned to the Phillies lineup. In his first game back, he hit a home run and an RBI double and went 3 for 5. He finished the season with a .332 batting average, 22 home runs, 103 RBIs, and 48 doubles. Chase also led the Phillies to their first playoff appearance in 14 seasons. He earned the Silver Slugger Award for the second consecutive season.\n\nWhen the 2008 season rolled around, Chase picked up where he had left off in 2007. In the month of April, he hit a league-leading eleven home runs and was named the National League\u2019s Player of the Month. After going through a midseason slump, Chase broke out of the slump with a 4-for-5 performance in a 4\u20130 shutout over the Oakland Athletics. Chase was also selected to start his third consecutive All-Star game. Once again, he led the Phillies to the playoffs and into the NLCS, where they will now face the LA Dodgers to advance to the World Series.","talking_about_count":511,"username":"chaseutley","website":"http:\/\/www.chaseutley.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"54299704360","name":"Chase Utley","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/chaseutley","likes":470489,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150708266949361","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/526677_10150708266949361_477857186_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

But it wasn\u2019t long before a darker side of the Superstar began to take hold. The truth, as he claims, set him free, but from the perspective of the rest of the WWE Universe, R-Truth slowly tilted toward madness in 2011.\n\nTruth turned on the people \u2014 the \u201cJimmys,\u201d as he describes them \u2014 claiming there were conspiracies at work in WWE that held him back and kept him from reaching his true potential. His paranoia soon turned vicious, leading him to cripple John Morrison and ignite a war with Rey Mysterio before going completely bonkers, donning a Confederate soldier\u2019s uniform and ransacking arena merch stands in pursuit of John Cena merchandise.\n\nTruth found company with The Miz, a similarly jilted Superstar, and the two waged war on WWE as Awesome Truth, a tag team out to uncover the supposed unjust underbelly of WWE. They made waves as a duo, even taking on the team of The Rock & John Cena at Survivor Series. A loss in that match, however, prompted an ugly falling out between the conspiracy theorists.\n\nNow, the WWE Universe finds itself entertained by R-Truth\u2019s zany conversations with his invisible friend, \u201cLittle Jimmy,\u201d and simply unpredictable behavior. And he found a perfect partner in Kofi Kingston as the duo captured the WWE Tag Team Championships in April 2012. After that key victory, the fun-loving pairing of Kingston & Truth drew comparisons to classic teams like The Rockers and The British Bulldogs, as they held WWE\u2019s twin titles for nearly five months before losing to Kane & Daniel Bryan at Night of Champions. In early October 2012, Truth and Kofi mutually decided to part ways as a tag team.\n\nAfter returning to singles competition, The Rapping Superstar officially became United States Champion Antonio Cesaro\u2019s No. 1 contender in early November, but failed to wrest the Star-Spangled championship from The Swiss Superman despite strong showings at Survivor Series and again at WWE TLC 2012.\n\nWhether he's proudly competing or entertaining the WWE Universe, R-Truth remains one of WWE\u2019s funniest, wackiest and most charismatic Superstars.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Kofi Kingston.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"The energy contained within one Kofi Kingston could power a major city for several years.\n\nA Ghanaian grappler with a beaming smile, Kingston\u2019s boundless enthusiasm is only rivaled by his limitless athleticism, which he displays fearlessly every time he steps in the ring to the delight of the entire WWE Universe. In fact, the only people who don\u2019t like Kofi Kingston are the Superstars he faces each week \u2014 and that\u2019s only because they can rarely catch him. The leader of the Boom Squad\u2019s dazzling aerials only belie what is actually a truly fierce fighter, who can curtail the smiles to kick it up in intensity if an opponent is foolish enough to set him off.\n\nRandy Orton, for example, tested Kofi\u2019s patience in late 2009, and paid for it when Kofi defaced The Viper\u2019s customized NASCAR before targeting Orton himself, leaping off a balcony at Madison Square Garden and splintering him through a table. Kofi\u2019s determination makes him a legitimate threat, and repeated favorite, in the annual Money in the Bank Ladder Matches, even though he\u2019s yet to snag the coveted briefcase amid his rampant boom-dropping. His creativity to survive in the Royal Rumble Match \u2014 like walking on his hands, lunging onto an eliminated Superstar\u2019s back or using a chair as a pogo stick \u2014 has quickly grown into an institution at the yearly January event.    \n\nKofi jumped to the tag team division in 2011, forming championship tandems with Evan Bourne and R-Truth. It was no surprise these duos drew comparisons to classic teams like The Rockers and The British Bulldogs.\n\nA multi-time Intercontinental and U.S. Champion, he returned to his roots as a solo competitor when he chased Intercontinental Champion The Miz off the \u201cLarry King Now\u201d set. Miz took offense, calling Kofi a \u201cB player\u201d who \u201creached his ceiling.\u201d The comment ignited a fire in The Dreadlocked Dynamo, as he defeated Miz to win his fourth Intercontinental Championship. After winning the rematch at WWE Hell in a Cell, Kingston said Miz\u2019s insults unleashed something he\u2019d been missing, his inner \u201cWildcat.\u201d\n\nKingston added a third U.S. Championship to his resume in April 2013, ending Antonio Cesaro\u2019s eight-month reign. Despite his new rival Cesaro, who pulled out a dreadlock from Kingston\u2019s hair after the rematch, this Superstar\u2019s future only continues to get brighter \u2014 probably because he actually keeps leaping closer and closer to the sun.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Kofi Kingston stats:\nWeight: 225 pounds\nFrom: Jamaica\n","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":20992,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars\/raw\/kofikingston","were_here_count":0,"id":"8089948555","name":"Kofi Kingston - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Kofi-Kingston-WWE-Universe\/8089948555","likes":1146320,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151892362108556","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1375129_10151892362108556_1761163336_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

After learning at the knee of The Glamazon (and to a lesser extent, Beth Phoenix's former beau, Santino Marella), Rosa Mendes was ready to fly on her own.\n\nMixing it up with Alicia Fox, Eve and others, the stunning Latina makes good use of the on-the-job training from Beth, a former Women\u2019s and Divas Champion.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Zack Ryder","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Some Superstars wait their entire careers for an opportunity to come along. Zack Ryder went out and created his own.\n\nThe self-described \u201cLong Island Iced-Z\u201d first gained prominence by hitching his wagon, along with then-partner Curt Hawkins, to a major star: The Rated-R Superstar, Edge. During that time, Ryder showed that, although he can be a goofball at times, he\u2019s more than willing to step up when called on a deliver the win. Together with Hawkins (as a part of the villainous faction La Familia), Ryder managed to capture the WWE Tag Team Championship, defeating Jesse & Festus and Finlay & Hornswoggle at The Great American Bash in 2008.\n\nWhen La Familia splintered in 2009, Zack was cut adrift, eventually turning up on ECW with a totally new look and a catchphrase that would soon be heard in arenas around the world \u2026 and computers as well: \u201cWoo Woo Woo! You know it!\u201d\n\nAfter circling around the bottom of the card for more than a year, Zack became disenfranchised with his place in the WWE picture. Knowing he had more to offer, he took a Flip cam and some ingenuity and created \u201cZ! True Long Island Story.\u201d Debuting on YouTube in February 2011, the show quickly became a sensation, racking up viewer upon viewer each week. Before long, Zack Ryder signs began cropping up at WWE events, WWE fans became obsessed with spiking their hair and chants of \u201cWoo Woo Woo!\u201d echoed from the rafters. Inspired by his overwhelming Twitter, Facebook and YouTube success, Zack introduced the \u201cInternet Championship\u201d on his web show and the self-christened titleholder soon found himself being endorsed by the likes of John Cena, who supported Ryder online and on TV.\n\nAs time went on, the groundswell could no longer be ignored, and Zack Ryder became a fixture on Raw. During his slow climb up the Monday night ladder, Ryder teamed up with Hollywood icon Hugh Jackman to defeat Dolph Ziggler, paired with John Cena in Raw main events and initiated the first-ever WWE \u201cTwitition\u201d to earn a United States Championship Match. Before long, Ryder\u2019s most \u201cliked\u201d achievement, however, was his triumph at WWE TLC 2011 when Long Island Iced-Z unseated rival Ziggler for the U.S. Title.\n\nThough Ryder ultimately lost the championship to Jack Swagger, he stayed in contention for the title through much of 2012. At Night of Champions, Ryder scored a crack at U.S. Champion Antonio Cesaro by outlasting 15 other competitors in a Pre-Show Battle Royal, but came up short in the title contest when Aksana provided an assist to Cesaro.\n\nAs 2013 continues to fold, Ryder appears to be concentrating less on fist-pumping and more on his in-ring objectives. Gone is the spiked hair, partying Broski that the Zack Pack came to know, replaced by a more serious WWE Superstar who\u2019s more focused on gaining wins than collecting digits.\n\nWith or without championship gold, Zack Ryder remains the definition of a 21st century Superstar. Using the Internet and social media, he created his own opportunity and fanned the flames of popular opinion all on his own. Now that he\u2019s intent on regaining a spot atop the WWE ladder, nothing\u2019s going to knock him off track. You know it.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Zack Ryder stats:\nWeight: 215\nFrom: Long Island, N.Y.\n","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":6773,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"21444496848","name":"Zack Ryder - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Zack-Ryder-WWE-Universe\/21444496848","likes":987112,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151703130666849","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1235542_10151703130666849_120180855_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

From there, she followed her twin sister Brie\u2019s lead into WWE.\n\nUnsuccessful in seizing spots in the 2006 WWE Raw Diva Search, the Bellas caught the eyes of execs and soon landed in FCW.

Three years later, at the Pan American Games, Henry captured a gold, silver and bronze medal. Henry\u2019s intimidating size and weightlifting prowess earned the attention of WWE, who signed him in 1996.

Hence, the moniker he carries today, 15 years after debuting in WWE, where Mark Henry stands at a terrifying peak.\n\nAfter years in and out of WWE fans\u2019 favor, Henry reached the zenith in 2011, becoming 50 pounds leaner and embracing the huge chip lingering on his shoulder.

Whether Henry can forcefully induct The Celtic Warrior into the Hall of Pain remains to be seen.\n\nWith a wealth of experience, the steady concentration of an ER surgeon, and the temper of Bruce Banner, the scariest thing about Mark Henry isn\u2019t the fact that he\u2019s The World\u2019s Strongest Man \u2014 it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s just getting started.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Big Show.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Reminiscent of such goliaths as Andre the Giant and Big John Studd, Big Show is a feared competitor who intimidates opponents with his size and stare alone. The World\u2019s Largest Athlete\u2019s measurements are astounding. He weighs 441 pounds, stands a mighty 7-feet tall, wears a 22 EEEEE size shoe and boasts a 64-inch chest. It\u2019s no surprise then that his in-ring debut left a crater-sized impression on the likes of Hulk Hogan and Ric Flair in WCW, where the young giant captured the WCW Championship on two occasions, along with the WCW Tag Team Championship.\n\nIn 1999, Show emerged as a global star upon signing with WWE, where he collided with Superstars of great acclaim and captured a slew of titles, including the WWE Championship. From \u201cStone Cold\u201d Steve Austin and The Rock to The Undertaker and Triple H, there\u2019s no top name in the business who hasn\u2019t succumbed to the man\u2019s battering ram of a fist. He\u2019s even gone toe-to-toe with world champion boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., who only managed to clean Show\u2019s clock at WrestleMania XXIV with the aid of brass knuckles.\n\nOn a lighter note, The World\u2019s Largest Athlete happens to be the world\u2019s largest fan of the Rat Pack. He\u2019s also an expert auto mechanic and owns a 64-foot yacht dubbed \u201cShowdaddie.\u201d And unlike the giants before him, Big Show harbors a sense of humor, which he put on full display in WWE Studios\u2019 2010 theatrical release, \u201cKnucklehead.\u201d\n\nYet make no mistake, Show, the first man to capture the WWE, WCW and ECW Championships, is still more proficient at delivering punches than punchlines. At 2011\u2019s Vengeance, he unleashed a devastating half-ton superplex on Mark Henry, which not only shook the ring to its core, but also caused it to implode. Now that\u2019s high impact. At WWE TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs 2011, Show captured his first World Heavyweight Championship and won the Intercontinental Title at WrestleMania XXVIII, marking another first for WWE\u2019s giant.\n\nDespite these accolades, Big Show turned his back on the fans by siding with John Laurinaitis at No Way Out 2012. But he did not hesitate to dump \u201cBig Johnny\u201d after Laurinaitis was ousted as General Manager following that pay-per-view, opting instead to go into business for himself and pursue personal vendetta against John Cena and, later, a championship rivalry with World Heavyweight Title holder Sheamus.\n\nAlthough The Celtic Warrior had been on a hot streak, The World\u2019s Largest Athlete asserted his supremacy over the Irish Superstar by clobbering him for the World Heavyweight Championship at Hell in a Cell. Big Show\u2019s second World Heavyweight Title reign was brief, thanks to the ascent of Alberto Del Rio, who used a commentary desk to bury Big Show during a championship Last Man Standing Match in January 2013.\n\nThen finding himself a target of the nefarious Shield trio, Big Show shockingly joined forces with fellow Shield haters Sheamus and Randy Orton to battle their common enemies at WrestleMania 29, but the combustible alliance wasn\u2019t destined to last. Following Dean Ambrose\u2019s pinfall on Orton, a visibly frustrated Big Show knocked out both allies and the next night on Raw, he went even further, decimating both The Viper and The Celtic Warrior.\n\nNow, Sheamus and particularly Orton, who convinced Sheamus to allow Big Show onto their team in the first place, seem interested in gaining some measure of retribution against the 7-footer.\n\nStill in possession of the world\u2019s largest mean streak, Big Show has had no problems making enemies, but he remains determined to prove he\u2019s the biggest, baddest dog in the yard. Best of luck to anyone who dares challenge him.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Big Show stats: \nHeight: 7 foot\nWeight: 441 pounds\nFrom: Tampa, Fla.\nSignature Move: Chokeslam; Cobra Clutch Backbreaker\nCareer Highlights: ECW World Champion, WWE Champion, WCW Champion, World Tag Team Champion, WWE Hardcore Champion, United States Champion","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Tampa","state":"FL","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":52534,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars\/raw\/bigshow ","were_here_count":0,"id":"10858891900","name":"Big Show - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Big-Show-WWE-Universe\/10858891900","likes":2899562,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151569509121901","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc1\/s720x720\/526917_10151569509121901_783717093_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

I was not particularly athletic, although my parents signed me up for every possible fitness activity they could. I tried swimming, sambo (a Russian martial art), ran track and even dabbled in gymnastics for a short period of time.  Due to my small frame, I never entertained the notion of bodybuilding\u2026that is, until I came to the United States.  In 1997, my family emigrated to the US, where I was approached by an agent from a top modeling agency in New York \u2013 Boss Models.  I accepted a 3 year contract with Boss, dropping my major in art, and pursued modeling. \n\nThe next few years I found myself working in print, runway and commercial roles, all the while flirting with the idea of getting in to bodybuilding.  Towards the end of my contract, I started gaining weight with the goal of joining an agency that would cater more to the type of physique I dreamed of building.  At the end of my contract with Boss Models, I met with a number of agencies in New York and decided on Silver Models. At the moment I am represented by Wilhelmina.\n\nThe re-creation of my physique, from frail to aesthetically, pleasing brought me many new opportunities.  Some of my favorites were :\n\nNike - NFKO show  (2011)\n7 Page Spread in Men\u2019s Fitness (August, 2010)\nMacy\u2019s catalogue (June, 2010)\nCover of Total Abs (hardcover fitness book by Neil Frost, 2009)\nCover (and centerfold) of Exercise for Men (Sept, 2008)\n\nAdditionally, I have done a good number of underwear catalogue jobs as well as numerous fashion week runway shows, that have contributed enormously to by confident on stage and in front of the camera.\n\nMy lifestyle drastically changed at the end of 2011, when I decided to make 1 resolution for each month of the 2012 year.  I had heard of a new division in the IFBB in 2011, called Men\u2019s Physique and was drawn to this style and idea that had a mainstream mass appeal.  I started training smarter and eating better than I had ever done before.  Friends and gym members started noticing my transformation and suddenly, people wanted to train with me. Soon, I was taking on more and more people to train, and the wave of change that they are making, filled me with a great feeling of excitement and purpose.  It drove me to fulfill one of my New Year\u2019s goals, which was to compete in the Men\u2019s Physique Division.  \n\nStarting in March of 2012, I entered my first physique contest (Steve Stone\u2019s NPC Metropolitan Show), where I came in 4th in my class. Excited beyond belief, I then did 7 more shows that year until I earned my pro card at the IFBB North Americans, taking my class and the overall title in Men\u2019s Physique. Subsequently, I did my 9th show for the year (and my first show as a pro) at the Houston Pro Show, where I took 6th place.  I am looking forward to the 2013 season with great anticipation and personal pride.  My competitive spirit comes not from winning against other opponents, but from the desire to beat myself.  I strive to dominate my past selves and give them a new person and champion to look up to,  as well as inspire and to take along with me all those who look to me as a professional athlete and competitor.\n\nSincerely,\n\n___________________________    \nAnton Antipov\nIFBB Men\u2019s Physique Pro\n\nE: inactive\u0040techie.com\n\nTwitter: \u0040maiseu\nFacebook: www.facebook.com\/antonantipovofficial\nBlog: antonfitness.blogspot.com\n","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"\"There are things that are handed to you because of your looks, there are things that are given to you based on your heritage, there are things you've achieved because of your family's determination and discipline to mold you into the person you are today.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page of \"The Funkasaurus\" Brodus Clay.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Is it funky in here or is it just Brodus Clay?\n\nThe only living, breathing Funkasaurus in captivity, the 375-pound dancing machine has descended from Planet Funk on a mission to move booties and mash bodies. Confused? Think of it this way \u2014 Brodus Clay is a rump shaker, and his opponents\u2019 backbones are the dance floor.\n\nHotstepping onto Raw in January of 2012, the boogie man shocked those WWE fans who were expecting the hyped Superstar to be more Hall of Pain than Soul Train. Indeed, the former bodyguard had been a humorless thug during his stint on WWE NXT season four and his brief time in the corner of Alberto Del Rio, but he\u2019s clearly marching to a different tune.\n\nKeeping the beat while he keeps on beating opponents, Clay has barreled through the likes of Curt Hawkins, JTG and William Regal with his signature running splash. It\u2019s the type of performance that demands attention, but if The Funkasaurus\u2019 serious strength and outlandish attitude don\u2019t grab you, his \"Funkadactyls\" \u2014 Naomi and Cameron, the two beautiful ladies in skintight catsuits shaking it by his side \u2014 certainly will. This trio is bringing some much-needed fun to the ring with their own dance, dance revolution.\n\nIn early 2013, Clay joined forces with Tensai after the two competed against each other in a Raw Roulette Dance-Off. The unorthodox pair has earned victories by defeating tandems like 3MB, Primo & Epico and Team Rhodes Scholars. The groovy pair looks to be ready to two-step all over their opponents in 2013. They were aptly named \"Tons of Funk\" on \"WWE Main Event\" in late March 2013.\n\nClay & Tensai joined The Funkadactyls to take on their recent rivals, Team Rhodes Scholars & The Bella Twins, the night after WrestleMania 29 on a monumental episode of Monday Night Raw! With the help of Naomi & Cameron, The Funkasauraus & \"Sweet T\" danced all over their arrogant and long-winded opponents!\n\nAlso, Brodus Clay will star in his first movie soon! WWE Studios has teamed with Pathe for \"No One Lives,\" a horror film that debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival. The movie features The Funkasaurus in his first supporting role and premieres May 10.\n\nGot a problem with this dino's funk?

Flanked by gorgeous dancers, Clay boogied his way around his competition showing he's not only funky, but he has the power to dominate in the ring.\n\nEarlier in his career, Clay finished second as a contestant on WWE NXT season four. Then the immense Clay worked as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Alberto Del Rio and was officially signed to a WWE contract by General Manager Theodore Long.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Drew McIntyre.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"While many fellow 15-year-olds were worried about sitting at the \u201cpopular table\u201d at lunchtime, Drew McIntyre was already training to become a WWE Superstar. At the young age of 22, McIntyre had skyrocketed from the independent scene to the big show, WWE contract in hand.\n\nFrom the get-go, McIntyre was determined to live up to the hype. Before even taking part in a single match, Drew turned SmackDown upside down in 2009 by launching a series of unrelenting attacks on more established Superstars, starting with R-Truth and Charlie Haas. The ruthless aggression paid dividends when he was personally awarded a SmackDown contract by Mr. McMahon, who called him a \u201cfuture World Champion.\u201d\n\nArmed with his aptly named Future Shock DDT, McIntyre continued to impress with a big win over John Morrison at WWE TLC 2009 to capture the Intercontinental Championship, and managed to hold the title for more than five months. Hungry for more accolades, \u201cThe Sinister Scotsman\u201d partnered with Cody Rhodes at Night of Champions 2010 to claim the WWE Tag Team Championship in a frenzied Tag Team Turmoil Match.\n\nDrew\u2019s alliance with Rhodes didn\u2019t last long, and McIntyre found his WWE career stagnating. SmackDown General Manager Teddy Long eventually gave McIntyre an ultimatum: win or you\u2019re fired. McIntyre did not succeed in gaining victory and was booted from the blue brand. Then\u2013Raw GM John Laurinaitis quickly snatched McIntyre up to join his WrestleMania XXVIII team. McIntyre and Team Johnny defeated Long\u2019s team, giving Laurinaitis full control of Raw and SmackDown.\n\nSince WrestleMania, McIntyre has found a common bond with fellow Superstars Heath Slater and Jinder Mahal. The three sneak attacked Brodus Clay on the Sept. 21 edition of SmackDown, leaving The Funkasaurus wondering what just hit him. McIntyre and his pals continued their attacks in the following weeks, often attacking Santino Marella, before busting out in an impromptu air guitar performance. The trio re-introduced themselves as 3MB on the Oct. 16 Raw from Nashville, Tenn. Sporting leather jackets and denim, McIntyre and company tried to take over the stage at a local country music bar, only to be kicked out before they could rock the house.\n\nNow, McIntyre and his bandmates are focused on winning the 2013 Royal Rumble Match. 3MB\u2019s cockiness has landed them in matches with several of their opponents in the over-the-top-rope battle, including Sheamus and Randy Orton. The rock \u2018n\u2019 rollers shocked The Celtic Warrior, using their three-on-one advantage to help Heath Slater win an Over-The-Top-Rope Challenge on Raw. Can 3MB replicate their success on Jan. 27?\n\nDeclaring they \u201care music,\u201d what does 3MB have planned for the next stop on their world tour?","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Stats: \nHeight: 6-foot-5\nWeight: 18 stone","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":8099,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"226605254953","name":"Drew McIntyre - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Drew-McIntyre-WWE-Universe\/226605254953","likes":361389,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150881706019954","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/398777_10150881706019954_827548099_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"IFBB Pro...Disciplined, focussed, hard-working and determined \u2013 four words that capture the essence of Gary Strydom, one of bodybuilding\u2019s icons.","affiliation":"IFBB, NPC, WBFF, WBF.","bio":"Gary Strydom is a South African\/Afrikaner\/American citizen...That lives in Thailand. Gary Strydom is a IFBB Professional bodybuilder whose career spans three decades. Between 1983 and 1992, Gary reigned supreme, claiming titles such as the US Championships, the Nationals and the Night of Champions. After over 12 years in retirement, in 2006 and at 46 years old he made a much publicised comeback in undoubtedly his best form ever, placing 7th at the Colorado Pro. With most of his competition some twenty years younger, Gary set the bodybuilding world abuzz with his dynamic new look and proved that bodybuilding is an Ageless sport. \n\nGary's life as a professional athlete began on the school sports fields back in his home country of South Africa. Highly competitive and determined by nature, Gary not only excelled in swimming, running track and rugby, his ability to lead others and his comfort in a competitive environment was clearly evident as he invariably turned up as team captain.\n\nThings were no different when it came time for Gary to perform his mandatory two year service in the South African Defence Force. He quickly advanced through the ranks from Private to Corporal and on to Sergeant, always leading his troops by example and constantly pushing the envelope by virtue of his natural ability to lead others. After finishing his two year service and at a point when most others were relieved to have completed their national service, Gary opted to take up the challenge of a further two years with the army and qualified as a radar technician.\n \nLife in the army was not one of comfort and ease and it was these years that Gary says strengthened his character, taught him the meaning of discipline and toughened him up for some of the greatest tests that were to face him in life.\n\nTowards the end of his army service Gary developed a serious interest in bodybuilding. Reading about his idols in magazines like Muscle and Fitness, he realised that most of them were based in the USA so the determined 20 year old decided that if he wanted to see them in person, train beside them and become a pro bodybuilder himself, he'd need to head for the US. When he informed his family of his decision his mother, knowing her son's appetite, replied \"You'll be home when you're hungry son.\" She underestimated his determination however and shortly after, Gary packed his bags and left South Africa, bound for New York with just $1000 and a plane ticket. He also carried a bonus ticket to any destination on the East Coast if so desired. Once on board the flight, it did not take the charming South African long to make friends and begin conducting some quick research on US cities.\n\nAs the plane took off, Gary Strydom, just twenty years old, was starting his epic journey to international success.\n\nHowever, while success was his end goal, his first priority was to decide if New York was to be his final stop or should he use the courtesy ticket and travel on. The decision came easy. Touching down in a snow-covered New York and having heard fellow passengers' opinions on where to continue on to, Strydom decided Miami and its warm climate much like South Africa's, stood out above the others. With no idea what to expect, Gary carried on to Miami. With his only knowledge about Miami being gleaned from a travel brochure, he had only one destination in mind once he arrived. When the shaven haired South African asked his taxi driver in a dead pan accent to \"take me to Liberty City\" he was greeted with a startled reaction. The cab driver attempted to inform Gary that Liberty City was, and still is, one of the most dangerous parts of Miami but Gary insisted. After one night in a dingy rundown hotel, he made his way to a nearby diner for one of his high protein breakfasts only to find a popular southern food called \"grits\" not cream of wheat as he was used to back home. While Gary was eating, he again made friends with some locals and explained his plans to take a Greyhound bus to California to find the bodybuilders he was looking to compete against. When his fellow diners informed him he'd have to take far more than one bus ride to reach California Gary opted to head further south to Key West.\n\nHe arrived in Key West on February 14, 1983, (a bad time for the average tourist), to find a far different culture of men than he was familiar with and one that in no way reflected his way of life back home or his lifestyle. His first night in Key West was spent on a park bench due to all the hotels being booked for this very famous date in Key West culture. He managed to find a place to stay the following day and worked odd jobs over the next few months to get himself started. Those were tough days for Gary who although fuelled by his dream, often missed the support structure of friends and family who were thousands of miles away.\n \nWith a membership at a small gym in Key West and a job working with troubled kids (his first love) he slowly started to get busy with training and laying the foundations for his career as one of the greatest bodybuilders of his time. His first competition was the 1983 Junior Florida where his great form made it clear to those who saw him that they were witnessing the emergence of a star. In 1984, he again stunned spectators and judges at the USA Championships, winning his weight class next to an impressive Jon Lloyd.\n\nAnd then the wheels nearly came off. As Gary turned his attention to competing at the American Nationals that same year, IFBB officials informed him he would need to be a US citizen to enter. Gary remembers asking the officials \"What's the difference, USA or Nationals?\" since he had just won the USA Championship without being a citizen, nevertheless it appeared the door was closed.\n\nRealizing the seriousness of the situation and not prepared to walk away from the chance to compete at the Nationals, Gary applied for citizenship and resigned himself to sitting by and waiting for the process to take its course. He didn't wait idly though, he got back in the gym and carried on training, fully focussed on being ready to compete as soon as his citizenship was granted. In 1986 his attorneys informed him that while they would do all they could, they could make no guarantees. Ever the optimist, Gary continued his contest preparation, training and dieting with the same commitment as any guy who didn't have the dark cloud of ineligibility looming over his head.\n\nAt virtually the 11th hour, just a week before the 1986 Nationals in Atlanta, Gary received his citizenship! He now realized that he would have to be more than ready as he would be going up against his magazine idols, names like Matt Mendanhall and Rory Leidermeyer. Despite the events leading up to the Nationals, Gary remained confident he had his competition beat. Having overcome all the hurdles placed in front of him, his gut instinct now told him that Atlanta would be his best day as an amateur. Sure enough, he was named victorious in Atlanta, walking away with something he had dreamt of for years.... his IFBB Pro Card!\n\nHis career immediately exploded into a massive whirlwind of magazine covers, worldwide guest appearances and the chance to stand next to Lee Haney in a photo shoot taken at Gold's Gym in Los Angeles, California.\n\nGary now realized that it would be a just a matter of time before he would have to take the stage in the Mr. Olympia. In 1987, he went to New York and was victorious in his first pro showing \u2013 'The Night of Champions 1987' was now his title.\n\nThe Night of Champions was one of many pro competitions that Gary would go on to win. In 1988, he made his Mr. Olympia debut, ripped to shreds and took a well-deserved fifth place. Over-dieted and knowing that he was not at his best he went on to mix it up at the 1989 Arnold Classic taking 3rd and followed that one week later with his second pro win, backing it up with three additional pro victories in Europe.\n\nGary Strydom had arrived and he was being closely watched as he advanced his career by someone with an eye for talent. Rumors began to circulate about a new federation in the works (much like the current PDI) with talk of Vince McMahon, the famous wrestling tycoon, venturing into bodybuilding and creating a new federation of superstars, with none other than Gary Strydom at the top of his list.\n\nIn 1990, Vince McMahon launched Bodybuilding Lifestyles magazine followed by the WBF (World Bodybuilding Federation), a new bodybuilding federation with a focus on talent and entertainment. Tom Platz, one of Gary's boyhood idols, was appointed the WBF's director of talent development and approached Gary to sign up. In Gary's mind it was the best business deal that would come his way in bodybuilding and he still beams when he speaks about this period of his life as he cherishes being the only WBF Champion in the history of bodybuilding.\n \nWhen asked recently about this controversial decision Gary remarked: \"I have no regrets, it was a business move. What would you do if a work opportunity was proposed that would pay you 12 times as much money with one-tenth the workload? It was a three year deal with guarantees!\" Bodybuilding had never seen that kind of money before. The wrestling czar Vince McMahon had made an offer to Gary that no bodybuilder would have refused, and Gary was the only bodybuilder offered the deal he received. There are rumours of first class plane tickets and VIP treatment, all true according to Gary. \"The athletes were well treated, well paid, and happy to have the opportunity and the exposure that Vince was able to provide them.\"\n\nHe recalls the great show they put on in Atlantic City, \"You Can't Touch This\". \"Everyone involved with bodybuilding at that time remembers the show, it was that impressive\". Gary won both shows and Atlantic City was Gary at his best. To this day people reminisce at how they would have liked to have seen Gary and Haney on the same stage that year. In 1992, the WBF show in Long beach was devastated by an extremely poor showing by many of the athletes due to strict drug testing. Gary still gave the crowd a great showing in Long Beach. He says, \"If a deal that lucrative came along again, watch others do exactly the same.\"\n\nGary still catches some flack for taking the WBF deal, but simply brushes it off as an opportunity of a lifetime that he alone was offered and took, and hopes that anyone offered a similar deal would be smart enough to take as well. So if there is any confusion about why Gary is back in the IFFB, he'll be quick to tell you he is a professional bodybuilder and loves to be on stage entertaining the fans and bringing talent to the sport that is his life.\n\nIn 1992, fans around the world were disappointed when Gary announced his retirement to focus on his burgeoning California Crazee-Wear clothing business. Many believed they had still not seen the best of Gary and that his exit was premature. But even though he was out of competition and off the stage, Gary was by no means finished with bodybuilding.\n\nFast forward to May 2006 when, now 46 years of age, Gary pulled off the finest move of his career to date making a mind-blowing comeback at the Colorado Pro, placing 7th and stunning fans and media alike with probably the best form of his life. Gary was back, bigger and better than ever and the bodybuilding world sat up and took notice.\n \nGary Strydom has reinvented himself unlike any other athlete in the sport of professional bodybuilding. In the twenty years since he first turned pro, countless others have come and gone and faded from memory. How many bodybuilders can claim to display their best form 20 years after turning pro?\n\nGary feels that bodybuilding has taken a down turn in recent years with athletes not considering lines and conditioning. \"You cannot just pack on muscle. It has to be accommodated by what frame you have.\" With his 6' 2\" frame, he has the height, the mass looks right on him and he continues to maintain his waistline, \"Crazy Coconut\" deltoids, and long thick quadriceps. \"Today its all about long muscle bellies, nobody looks like me up there,\" he continues \"Look at the physiques on stage today (especially Denver) so many of them look the same. I am 46 years of age on stage with 26 year old athletes, how many other sports do you see athletes doing this?\" He has a point.\n\nIt is rare to find a comeback athlete who generates the kind of international frenzy that Gary Strydom's 2006 appearance made. Denver placed Gary firmly back in the spotlight and once again he was on international magazine covers and inundated with requests to undertake guest appearances and seminars around the globe. It seemed the world had been waiting for a comeback of this calibre and what better man for the job than one of bodybuilding's most popular and down to earth athletes who ascribes his success to nothing more than hard work, discipline and a focussed approach to achieving his goals.\n\nSo massive was the reaction to his return, that Gary had to forego plans to compete again later in 2006 and early 2007 in order to meet international appearance commitments. \"Denver was no 'one night stand',\" he says. \"When I said I was back, I meant I was back. I didn't go to Denver as a once off attempt, just to see how I would do. I am a bodybuilder, it's my passion and it's my life. In the years since I retired I've never stopped living that lifestyle or training. The comeback was more like the beginning of a new competitive career for me. I had planned to do a couple more shows last year but that didn't work out. But this year I'll be back up there on stage again and maybe for good couple of years to come too.\"\n","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"Gary Strydom IFBB Professional  bodybuilder.

{"about":"Sponsored Athlete with Magnum and Shiek Gloves\n   Actor\/Fitness Model and follower of JESUS CHRIST.","affiliation":"Magnum Sponsored Athlete ","awards":"2011 Wbff Male Fitness Champion","bio":"Growing up I was always a hard gainer. I ate everything in sight, from pastas to fast food, and never gained a pound. People were blown away by how much I could eat as I would often have multiple breakfast meals and was always going for seconds at lunch and dinner.  All that eating and I still just couldn\u2019t seem to gain weight or strength.\n \nLooking back I\u2019m guessing that part of the reason I had trouble gaining weight was because I was a cross-country runner from third grade all the way up through high school. It wasn\u2019t uncommon to see me running along side the country roads or in local parks because I was running up to 80 miles a week in the summertime.\n \nMy cross country coach introduced me to weight lifting in the sixth grade as he had the whole team lifting light weights 2-3 days a week in the summer time and early in the season. He felt that as runners it was important to have descent upper body strength and some good leg strength as well.  But as I said before, I never seemed to make any progress in gaining weight and my strength didn\u2019t change a whole lot either.  I always had the \u2018bulldog\u2019 work ethic, but just didn\u2019t seem mature enough to get great results. Looking back I know that was exactly why I wasn\u2019t really getting those physical \u2018outward\u2019 results. Junior high is just a little bit too young to be hitting the gym for those bulking results.\n \nFast forward to my senior year (1999), when I signed up to be in the weight lifting class at my school. When I started the 18 week class I was about 5\u20198\u201d & 130lbs. For the first month it was the usual as I was still only benching & squatting a measly 135lbs as that just seemed to be my weak bodies plateau and it was quite embarrassing. Not only was I scrawny, but I was a weakling too.\n \nAll of this scrawny\/weakling stuff began to change when I was introduced to supplements. I started taking protein powders and creatine and as a result noticed a significant difference in both my size and strength within weeks.  Every class I was reaching a new max on bench and squat.  I was also noticing that my arms were getting bigger, my chest was starting to grow\/form, and my abs were getting bulkier and more defined as well. I continued to stack these products throughout the weight training course and by the end of the 18 weeks I was weighing 145lbs, benching 265lbs, and was squatting 275lbs. These gains were mind blowing and I was so pleased with the results of my strength, weight, and build.\nAfter graduating high school I went off to college (Indiana State University) and got even more serious about weight training.  I was training 5-6 days a week and running 2-3 miles about 3 days a week. I continued to take my protein, cycling on and off of the creatine, and was still experiencing all the amazing results along with some great recovery too. Within the first few years of college my dedication to the gym went up to 6-7 days a week and my weight training program turned into more of bodybuilding program. I was so pleased as I had reached my maximum height of 5\u201911\u201d and was weighing 170lbs. At that point in time my max on bench press was 305lbs, and I was squatting 325lbs.\n \nMy final two years of college I got even more serious about weight training and to be honest I had become an addict as I was so thrilled with all the positive results. I dedicated to training my legs harder, increased my protein intake and was still taking creatine as well.  It was in that time that I introduced glutamine to my supplementation list too.  By my senior year (2005) my weight was up to 185lbs, my max on bench was 335lbs, I was squatting 405lbs 4-6 reps, and leg pressing 945lbs.\n \nToward the end of my senior year I was made aware of some local bodybuilding shows, the Mr. Indiana State University & the Mr. Wabash Bodybuilding shows.  I figured with all this hard work I had already put in I may as well take it to another level and so I joined these shows. For these shows I experienced competition dieting for my first time and had also depleted my carbohydrates & water to help bring out the cuts and vascularity. This took me from that high weight of 185lbs down to my competition weight of 162lbs. All that dieting paid off because it taught me discipline and I ended up being blessed with a win in both of the competitions.\nWinning those competitions is what ended up bringing me out to California in pursuit of a full time career as a fitness model. To compete with these big dogs I really had to step up my game in the gym and treat it like the job it had now become.  I was still taking protein and cycling creatine\/glutamine and things got to a whole new level when I started taking NO supplements. My pumps and vascularity had reached a level that I never thought possible. It was in that time (2007-2009) that I really started to show up in a majority of the fitness magazines all the time and I began to land fitness magazine covers too, which was a dream come true.  I was also filming a lot of infomercials and working on several shoots with bodybuilding.com.\n \nEach accomplishment encouraged me to work even harder in the gym and develop that \u201cNo Pain, No Gain\u201d training attitude. As a result of my go get-er attitude I ended up meeting and working with Jay Cutler (4-time Mr. Olympia).  We started working on our FitnessVTC website (www.fitnessvtc.com) where we virtually personal train people and give them tips on dieting. I am also the virtual host on that website. Since I was spending a lot of time with him I began picking his brain to learn some of his little weight training\/dieting secrets.  He gave me some great tips and also gave me an honest evaluation of my build and really critiqued me too.\n \nAs a result, 2010 had become an incredible year for both my physical results and fitness modeling exposure.  I landed covers of eight fitness magazines and the most exciting one for me was REPS magazine.  Landing that cover was a big deal to me because you have to be closer to a bodybuilding look to land that cover. I was the first model ever and only model to date to land the covers of both Robert Kennedy Publications, Maximum Fitness & REPS!, and I landed them both in the same year. Not to mention I was also excited to consistently be featured in a majority of the fitness magazines on the shelves every month. To top it off I ended the year by becoming one of the main spokesmodels for Jay Cutler\u2019s clothing line and I signed a supplement contract with Schiek fitness gear.\n \nI worked off of the momentum from 2010 to make 2011 my best year in the fitness industry. I landed the covers of four different fitness magazines and have three more covers coming out before the end of the year. I accomplished my goal of becoming the top fitness model in the world by winning the 2011 WBFF \u2018Pro Male Fitness Model\u2019 World Championship, which took place in Canada in late August.","birthday":"07\/23\/1980","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"North Hollywood","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":34781,"username":"JamesEllisFitness","website":"jamesellisfit.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"253946261318224","name":"James Ellis","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JamesEllisFitness","likes":223619,"cover":{"cover_id":615435065169340,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1395313_615435065169340_1622740991_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The official WWE Facebook fan page for Santino Marella.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Don\u2019t believe in miracles? Try telling that to Santino Marella, the recipient of the divine intervention that transpired in Milan on April 16, 2007. During Raw\u2019s first-ever broadcast in Italy, Marella was a young fan in the front row who not only accepted Mr. McMahon\u2019s open challenge to face the nigh-unstoppable Umaga, but inexplicably defeated The Samoan Bulldozer for the Intercontinental Championship.\n\nInitially, many believed this Italian braggadocio\u2019s stay in WWE had the lasting power of an all-froth cappuccino \u2014 offering subtle hints of finely ground flavor, though ultimately providing a tasteless imbalance of foam and espresso. But Santino Marella is no stale cannoli. In fact, he has made a career out of improbable moments that have been savored to the delight of the WWE Universe. He\u2019s captured the attention of more than a few Divas (even before he shaved his unibrow), as well as his share of championships, both as an individual and a tag partner. He had the fastest elimination in 2009\u2019s Royal Rumble (1.9 seconds in 2009) \u2014 a feat that only he could dare claim as a badge of honor. And if you think he\u2019s the only successful Marella in his family, bear in mind that his \u201ctwin sister\u201d Santina is a former \u201cMiss WrestleMania.\u201d\n\nYes, Santino Marella\u2019s time in WWE has been nothing if not unique \u2014 and certainly not without its share of success. In addition to his Intercontinental Title reign, Marella also laid claim to the United States Championship in March 2012. His championship run came to a crashing halt against Antonio Cesaro at The 25th Anniversary of SummerSlam, but the Italian rapscallion can still boast about having the eighth-longest reign since the title was reinstated by WWE in 2003.\n\nSince losing the title, Marella has been trying to tame The Cobra\u2019s infatuation with Cesaro\u2019s flame, Aksana. The reptilian sock couldn\u2019t keep its eyes off the beauty, though, leading Marella to try and regain the U.S. Championship without his most devastating maneuver. In a rematch against Cesaro on the Sept. 3 edition of Raw, he reached into his singlet for The Cobra, but an attack from Cesaro put the reptile out of reach. Unable to recover it, Cesaro once again defeated his Italian foe.\n\nThe WWE Universe already knows full well that this lovable Italian is a gifted competitor and a true showman. Whether he\u2019s in the ring competing, on the mic butchering the English language or trumpeting his invisible brass band in celebration, the WWE Universe knows that it\u2019s going to be entertained.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Santino Marella stats:\nFrom: Calabria, Italy\nCareer Highlights: Won Intercontinental Championship on April 16 Raw in Milan, Italy\n","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":16646,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"8281498739","name":"Santino Marella - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Santino-Marella-WWE-Universe\/8281498739","likes":953677,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151856436643740","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1466219_10151856436643740_1110519583_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Sheamus.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"With a red-hot temper that matches his fiery head of hair, Sheamus never backs down from a fight, and has never been in one he didn\u2019t think he could win. Hailing from Dublin, Sheamus brings to the ring a ferocious offensive style that harkens to his noble and heroic Celtic ancestors. Whether by upbringing or by birthright, this modern-day Celtic Warrior was fated for combat.\n\nAfter journeying from ECW to Monday Night Raw in October 2009, Sheamus ravenously sunk his teeth into the competition, engaging in a high-profile rivalry with John Cena in pursuit of the WWE Championship. At WWE TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, the ginger-headed juggernaut clashed with the Cenation leader in a pine-splintering Tables Match and defeated Cena to become the first-ever Irish-born WWE Champion.\n\nNot resting on his laurels following a momentous victory over one of the most decorated WWE Superstars in history, The Celtic Warrior continued to collect accolades, winning the 2010 King of the Ring and capturing the illustrious United States Championship in March 2011.\n\nAlthough Sheamus thrived off his ability to raise the ire of the WWE Universe by pummeling their heroes \u2014 namely the likes of Cena, Triple H and Randy Orton \u2014 the boos directed at him were eventually replaced by thunderous cheers after he was drafted to SmackDown in 2011.\n\nAfter winning the 2012 Royal Rumble, Sheamus paved his Road to WrestleMania and defeated World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan in a record-setting 18 seconds to win the title.\n\nAfter capturing the World Title on the Grandest Stage of Them All, The Celtic Warrior again proved himself a dominant and fighting champion, mixing a powerhouse offense \u2014 which includes the Brogue Kick, White Noise, the High Cross, the Irish Curse Backbreaker and the Cloverleaf submission maneuver \u2014 with an innate Celtic thirst for battle.\n\nIn an epic showdown against Big Show at Hell in a Cell, Sheamus became the first Superstar to miraculously kick out of the devastating KO Punch, only to see his nearly seven-month-long title reign come to an end after suffering a second dose of the dreaded finishing maneuver.\n\nHowever, while the championship gold is no longer around his waist, that hardly meant that the spotlight had moved away the Superstar who loves to fight. Following a brutal series of battles against Big Show \u2014 both inside and outside the ring \u2014 Sheamus returned to the 2013 Royal Rumble Match, lasting until the final three and eliminated five competitors, tied for the most with Ryback! He then once again set his sights on the WrestleMania battlefield at MetLife Stadium, joining forces with Randy Orton and Big Show in a Six-Man Tag Team Match against their treacherous adversaries, The Shield.\n\nMost recently, the Irish Superstar has found himself in a brutal rivalry with Mark Henry, after The World's Strongest Man attacked him on two separate occasions. With each passing week, their intense conflict has grown more and more intense - particularly with The Celtic Warrior embarrassed his enraged adversary during both a \"Tug of War\" and an \"Arm Wrestling Challenge.\"","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Height: 6-foot-3\nWeight: 272 pounds\nFrom: Dublin, Ireland","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Dublin","state":"","country":"Ireland","zip":""},"talking_about_count":39333,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"139548194814","name":"Sheamus - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Sheamus-WWE-Universe\/139548194814","likes":2731239,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152236409524815","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1233386_10152236409524815_1602959529_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Armed with deceptively handsome looks, he isn't shy about flashing his charming smile, either.\n\nFirst competing in WWE NXT season one, Gabriel has brought his rebellious nature to groups like The Nexus and The Corre. It was in the vast majority of the attacks by these factions that Gabriel introduced the WWE Universe to his lethal 450\u02da splash, which served as the emphatic exclamation mark on each calculated assault. Every time he gracefully executes his body crushing trademark maneuver, he sends a crystal clear message to each and every WWE Superstar, as well as the WWE Universe at large.\n\nGabriel\u2019s shaken off a bit of his former nastiness, and has recently found more success with the support of the WWE Universe than without it.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Ryback.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"If the measure of a man is what he does with power, then measuring the capabilities of a Superstar as commanding as Ryback may prove difficult.\n\nCrushing his opponents with stoic disregard, the 6-foot-3, 291-pound monster has the strength and focus of a machine that was designed to annihilate. Ryback approaches every challenge with brute force and a no-nonsense demeanor that exudes supreme confidence in his own abilities. He doesn't just possess the skills to destroy a rival at any time \u2014 he carries himself as if that result is never in doubt.\n\nOne only needs to observe how Ryback\u2019s fellow Superstars study him to understand his ruthless reputation.

One week later, Danica Patrick graced the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first Indy car driver to be featured on the front page in 20 years. \n\nThree years later, in April 2008, Patrick became the first woman to win a major-league open-wheel race in a North American series with her win in the IZOD IndyCar Series Indy Japan 300 at the Twin Ring Motegi oval in Japan. That victory set her up for her second Sports Illustrated cover just three weeks later, making her just the fourth racecar driver (Jimmie Johnson, Dale Earnhardt Jr., and Al Unser) to twice grace the cover of the famous magazine. \n\nFor 2012, Patrick moves from the IndyCar Series to a fulltime stock-car schedule competing in the stepping-stone NASCAR Nationwide Series for JR Motorsports, while also competing in 10 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races for Stewart-Haas Racing (SHR) driving the No. 10 GoDaddy.com Chevrolet, beginning with the season-opening Daytona 500 at Daytona (Fla.) International Speedway. She\u2019ll look to become the first woman to win a NASCAR-sanctioned event and add another chapter to her already storied career. \n\nIt\u2019s a story that began in Roscoe, Ill., 90 miles northwest of Chicago and five miles south of the Illinois-Wisconsin state line, where Patrick was raised. Like many of today\u2019s successful drivers, including SHR co-owner Tony Stewart, Patrick began competing in go-karts at a young age. During her time in karting from 1992 to 1997, she won numerous regional titles while also winning the World Karting Association Grand National Championship in 1994, 1996 and 1997. Her team owner Stewart captured the same title 10 years earlier in 1987. \n\nFrom there, Patrick made a career-changing decision, leaving the comfort of friends and family in the Midwest to move to Europe to compete in the cutthroat world of European road racing. After spending the 1998 and 1999 seasons driving in the British Formula Vauxhall Series, Patrick moved to the British Zetec Formula Ford Series for 2000 and 2001. She garnered plenty of attention by finishing second in the prestigious Formula Ford Festival in 2000 at the famous Brands Hatch road course in England, the highest finish ever for an American in the event. \n\nThree-time IndyCar Series champion and 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal was impressed by Patrick\u2019s accomplishments in Europe and signed her to drive in the United States for his team, Rahal Letterman Racing (RLR). After opening the 2002 season by winning the professional portion of the Toyota Pro\/Celebrity race from the pole at the Long Beach (Calif.) Grand Prix, Patrick competed in five Barber Dodge Pro Series events for RLR. She again impressed by scoring a season-best fourth-place result at the Vancouver Grand Prix in Canada.\n\nPatrick moved up to the prestigious Toyota Atlantic series in 2003 and became the first woman in series history to finish on the podium with a third-place result at the road course in Monterrey, Mexico. She bested that effort by one spot later in the year when she finished second on the street course in Miami, Fla. Patrick finished the year sixth in points with five top-fives. \n\nShe continued to improve in 2004 as she finished third in the Toyota Atlantic Series standings with an impressive run of 10 top-five finishes in 12 races. In June of that season, at the road course in Portland, Ore., Patrick became the first woman in series history to win the pole before finishing second in the race. Her runner-up finish gave her the points lead, making her the first woman ever to lead the standings in the prestigious feeder series.\n \nIn 2005, Patrick moved up with RLR to the IndyCar Series and it didn\u2019t take long for her to serve notice that she would be a factor. In just her fourth career start, she qualified second and led 32 laps en route to an impressive fourth-place finish at Twin Ring Motegi.\n\nHer momentum from Motegi carried her into one of the most memorable performances in the more than 100 years of racing at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Patrick set numerous records during her Indianapolis 500 debut and set the tone early when she posted the fastest lap on the opening day of practice. She went on to set the fastest practice lap five times throughout the month \u2013 more than any other driver \u2013 including Pole Day and Carb Day. \n\nPatrick\u2019s practice lap of 229.880 mph on Pole Day was the fastest of any driver during the month and the fastest turned by any woman in the history of Indianapolis Motor Speedway. During her qualification attempt, Patrick made an impressive save as her car bobbled in turn one on her first lap, earning her rave reviews for her car control by longtime Speedway observers. She ended up qualifying fourth, the best ever starting position for a woman in the historic race. \n\nOn race day, with 11 laps remaining in the 200-lap event, Patrick blew past leader Dan Wheldon and held the point until lap 194, when she was forced to slow down in order to conserve fuel to make it to the finish. Patrick ended up fourth \u2013 the best finish ever for a woman at Indianapolis at that time \u2013 and brought her Rookie of the Year honors for her efforts, which included leading the race three times for 19 laps. \n\nPatrick went on to win poles at Kansas Speedway in Kansas City, Kentucky Speedway in Sparta and Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, Ill., tying her with Tomas Scheckter for most poles by a rookie in a season. Patrick finished 12th in points with seven top-10 finishes and earned the series\u2019 Rookie of the Year honors, as well as being named the series\u2019 Most Popular Driver. \n\nThe 2006 season began with Patrick making her debut in the GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series Rolex 24 At Daytona at Daytona (Fla.) International Speedway, co-driving a Porsche Crawford with Rusty Wallace, Allan McNish and Jan Lammers for Howard-Boss Motorsports. Unfortunately, the team suffered a mechanical failure just past the nine-hour mark and placed 24th after retiring early. \n\nIn the IndyCar Series that year, Patrick scored a pair of fourth-place finishes en route to a ninth-place finish in points. At Indianapolis, she continued to impress as she started 10th and finished eighth while again being named the series\u2019 Most Popular Driver. \n\nFor 2007, Patrick switched to Andretti-Green Racing (now Andretti Autosport) and continued her rise in the season-ending points standings with a seventh-place result on the strength of 11 top-10 finishes. She tied Sarah Fisher\u2019s record for best finish by a woman with a second-place effort at the Belle Isle street circuit in Detroit and, for the third consecutive year, was named the series\u2019 Most Popular Driver. Patrick again performed well at the Indianapolis 500 with her third straight top-10 finish as she came home eighth in the rain-shortened race. \n\nWith her skills improving each year, it was only a matter of time before Patrick found victory lane, and she did so in April 2008 at Motegi. It was a win that was heard around the sports world and helped propel her to her best points finish, yet, as she ended the year sixth in the standings on the strength of nine top-10 results. Unfortunately, despite starting fifth, her string of top-10 finishes at the Indianapolis 500 came to an end after she was involved in a pit-road collision with Ryan Briscoe on lap 171 and placed 22nd. \n\nIn 2009, Patrick again opened the racing season in the Rolex 24 At Daytona, where she finished eighth driving a Crawford Pontiac with Andy Wallace, Rob Finlay and Casey Mears for Childress-Howard Motorsports. At the Indianapolis 500 in May, she started 10th and finished an impressive third, the best result ever for a woman at Indy.\n\nPatrick continued to climb the points ladder as she ended the season fifth in the standings on the strength of 10 top-10 finishes \u2013 the third consecutive year she compiled at least 10 finishes of 10th or better. \n\nMore records came Patrick\u2019s way in 2010 when, following the August race at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, Calif., she set the record for most consecutive races running at the finish. Infineon marked the 29th time she had completed a race without a DNF (Did Not Finish), and she ended the year 10th in points. And, once again, she was solid at Indianapolis for, despite starting a career-worst 23rd, she came home sixth. \n\nWhile the IndyCar Series continued to be Patrick\u2019s main focus, she began dabbling in stock car racing in 2010 and opened her career with an impressive sixth-place finish in the season-opening Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) event at Daytona. One week later, she made her NASCAR debut in the Nationwide Series and finished 35th after being involved in a multi-car accident midway through the event. \n\nShe continued to adapt to the heavier stock cars throughout a 13-race Nationwide Series schedule that year. Her average finish in her first seven races was 31.1, while her average finishing position in the last six events improved to 24.3. To gain additional stock-car experience, she competed in the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East event in September at Dover (Del.) International Speedway, where she started 13th and finished sixth. \n\nIn 2011, Patrick continued to drive in both the IndyCar Series and the NASCAR Nationwide Series and finished 10th in IndyCar Series points on the strength of nine top-10 finishes, including a 10th-place result in the Indianapolis 500. In seven starts at Indianapolis, Patrick has compiled six top-10 finishes in seven starts and completed 97.7 percent of the laps available to her. \n\nOne again, she did not record a DNF, meaning that she had gone an IndyCar Series-record 50 races without failing to finish. \n\nOn the NASCAR side, Patrick continued to improve while running 12 Nationwide Series races with an average finish of 17.4. She scored three top-10 and six top-15 finishes, including a fourth-place result in March at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. The finish was the best ever by a woman in a NASCAR national stock-car series, besting a fifth-place run by Sarah Christian in a Sprint Cup race in 1949 at Heidelberg (Pa.) Raceway. \n\nIn addition to her success at Las Vegas, Patrick led 13 of 100 laps in July at Daytona en route to a 10th-place result. \n\nOne of the most recognizable athletes in the world, Patrick has graced the cover of ESPN: The Magazine and TV Guide and was featured in pictorials in the 2008 and 2009 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. \n\nIn 2012, Patrick finished 10th in Nationwide Series standings, and ran ten races in the Sprint Cup series as prep for a full-time move to the series in 2013. She also was voted 2012 NASCAR Nationwide Series Most Popular Driver by the fans.","birthday":"03\/25\/1982","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Chicago","state":"IL","country":"United States","zip":""},"personal_info":"Danica Sue Patrick (born March 25, 1982) is an American auto racing driver, currently competing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, and the NASCAR Nationwide Series, as well as a model and advertising spokeswoman. \n\nDanica was named the Rookie of the Year for both the 2005 Indianapolis 500 and the 2005 IndyCar Series season.

{"about":"The official WWE Facebook fan page for a \"Real American\", Jack Swagger!","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Arrogance, athleticism and American pride all collide to create the larger than life persona of Jack Swagger. At 6-foot-6, 263 pounds, Swagger first came to WWE in 2008 as part of then-ECW General Manager Theodore Long's New Superstar Initiative and became one of most successful products of Long\u2019s program.\n\nGrowing up, Swagger was enamored with sports-entertainment greats Danny Hodge and \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams, both of whom would personally help the Superstar on his career path. First becoming involved in competition at age five and attending a high school that boasted several state wrestling championships, he quickly developed into an outstanding amateur grappler, becoming a two-time high school heavyweight state champion. In true American fashion, he earned a full scholarship to a Division I school in both wrestling and football.\n\nSwagger's tremendous amateur background carried him into the world of WWE, in a manner reminiscent of such legends as Bob Backlund and WWE Hall of Famers Jack and Gerald Brisco. His defined technique brought a completely different competitive style to ECW, and the WWE Universe took notice of his impressive combination of strength, ability and squared circle acumen, all complementing his physique and charisma.\n\nAt WrestleMania XXVI, Swagger reached a new level of greatness when he overcame nine other Superstars to win the spectacular Money in the Bank briefcase on The Grandest Stage of Them All. Just five days later, Swagger stunned the WWE Universe by cashing in his title opportunity against Chris Jericho to become the new World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nSwagger has described himself as the best of the best, but his recent form since relinquishing the United States Championship in March 2012 has left the cocky competitor looking for a second wind. And with Vickie Guerrero no longer managing him and Dolph Ziggler no longer in his corner, Swagger will need to prove himself once again \u2014 on his own.\n\nAfter a three-month losing streak, Swagger announced on the Sept. 3, 2012, edition of Raw that he would be taking some extended time off. Five months later, he returned to WWE looking re-energized and even more aggressive. In February 2013, he appeared on Raw with Zeb Colter, who had some controversial words about what it means to be a \"Real American,\" like himself and Swagger. At Elimination Chamber, Swagger proved he is more powerful than ever, shockingly outlasting five other Superstars to win the Elimination Chamber Match and earn a World Heavyweight Championship opportunity at WrestleMania 29.\n\nSince then, Swagger and Colter have been at incredble odds against Alberto Del Rio. The outspoken duo has taken verbal jabs at the Mexican Superstar's heritage, and Swagger has showed no mercy in his attacks against Del Rio. Swagger even went so far as to break Ricardo Rodriguez's ankle with a vicious Patriot Lock.\n\nDespite trapping the World Champion in the Patriot Lock at WrestleMania 29, Swagger was unable to make Del Rio submit, tapping out himself to the Cross Armbreaker. As he and Colter walked away from the ring in MetLife Stadium, though, their eyes were fixated on Del Rio and his golden prize, perhaps signaling that this struggle is just beginning.\n\nJust a week after Del Rio lost the World Title to Dolph Ziggler on the post-WrestleMania Raw, it was announced that Swagger will meet his two rivals in a Triple Threat  Match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Extreme Rules. That bout became a Ladder Match after Del Rio won the opportunity to pick the stipulation when Rodriguez defeated Colter and Big E Langston on Raw.\n\nWith this mat technician's incredible arsenal of maneuvers, who is going to doubt his ability to get back on top?","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Stats:\nWeight: 263 pounds\nWWE Debut: Sept. 9, 2008","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Perry","state":"OK","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":14357,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars\/raw\/jackswagger","were_here_count":0,"id":"37269719594","name":"Jack Swagger - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Jack-Swagger-WWE-Universe\/37269719594","likes":482295,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151951792654595","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/541855_10151951792654595_1367485679_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

I began playing sports at the young age of 5 and it was essentially the beginning of what has become an epic journey. I was always a very athletic kid growing up and I soon realized that being physically strong and in great shape helped give me an even greater advantage over my competition. This desire and overwhelming passion to be different than everyone else inspired me to begin lifting weights at the age of 12. It is this passion to be unique that gives me the drive and motivation to be the best, and accomplish all that I can so that one day, when I die, my name will live on for ever. Going into my senior year of high school I was an All-American wrestler, All-State football player, and had set multiple records in track. I had multiple full ride scholarships for football and wrestling and pretty much planned on having my college education paid for through sports. But sometimes life doesn't happen the way you expect. My first football game of my senior year I tore my ACL and shattered my dreams. It was a pretty depressing time in my life. Not only was my dream of playing sports in college shattered but all of my scholarship offers were gone, leaving me with no way to pay for college. I tore my ACL a 2nd time a couple months later and definitely thought my life was over lol. A few days before my 1st surgery, I was on the bodybuilding.com website and I stumbled across the new bodybuilding category called Men\u2019s Physique. I had been training consistently for 6 years at that time and knew this was my calling. Needless to say, a month later I tried it out and won the overall title at my first show. Exactly a year after my first competition I went on to win the Jr. Nationals competition which made me the youngest IFBB Professional in history! Two months after becoming an IFBB Pro I won my first Pro show that qualified me to step on stage at the first ever Mr. Olympia Men's Physique Showdown. This is just the beginning of my journey that has taken me to various parts of the world and has introduced me to many incredible people. I'm very excited about this new chapter in my life and to see what this world has in store for me!","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":163884,"username":"officialjeffseid","website":"www.jeffseid.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"213077728797666","name":"Jeff Seid","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/officialjeffseid","likes":1092295,"cover":{"cover_id":449193121852791,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1455115_449193121852791_619057462_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Popularly known as Faisal in his family, Shakib Al Hasan was a very intelligent and clever boy. His father was a very good football player and wanted his son to be one as well. But Shakib had other interests.\n\nEven at a very young age, Shakib used to earn a fair amount of money as he used to be hired to play for different villages. In one of these matches Shakib impressed an umpire who arranged for him to practice with the Islampur Para Club, a team in the Magura Cricket League. During the practice session, Shakib batted aggressively and bowled fast, as he usually did, but also chose to experiment with spin bowling and proved effective.\n\nPICKED UP A WICKET IN HIS VERY FIRST BALL!\nHe was picked to play for Islampur and took a wicket with his first ball; it was his first delivery with a proper cricket ball, having previously generally played with a taped tennis ball. He spent six months training at Bangladesh Krira Shiksha Pratisthan, a government-run sports institute.\n\n...EARLY INTERNATIONAL CAREER:\nIn 2005, during the final of a tri-nation tournament involving England and Sri Lanka's Under-19 teams, Shakib scored an 86-ball century and took three wickets to help his team to victory. Between 2005 and 2006, Shakib played 18 youth One Day Internationals; he scored 563 runs at an average of 35.18, and took 22 wickets at an average of 20.18.\n\nHe made his international debut against Zimbabwe in 2006 and impressed one and all. Shakib Al Hasan soon became a regular member of the team and became a man to rely on. He performed consistently both with the bat and ball for Bangladesh team.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS:\nIn 2009, he was rewarded as Shakib Al Hasan became the number 1 ODI all rounder. In the same year, Shakib was named the Wisden Cricketer of the year. He later became the first ever Bangladeshi to play in the English County Cricket League. Under his Captaincy, Bangladesh has defeated team like West Indies, whitewashed New Zealand and beaten the powerhouses. In 2012, recently, he also became the number 1 Test all rounder of World Cricket.","birthday":"03\/24\/1987","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":96056,"username":"Shakib.Al.Hasan","website":"\u003C\u003Cnot-applicable>>","were_here_count":0,"id":"89058995393","name":"Shakib Al Hasan","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Shakib.Al.Hasan","likes":777474,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152780289710394","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/943656_10152780289710394_1674600709_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

He could not wait to carry on his father\u2019s legacy while carving out one of his own in WWE.\n\nWith his \u201cdashing\u201d appearance and natural ability, Cody appeared destined for success from the start. The second-generation Superstar quickly fulfilled that promise in the tag team ranks, capturing several championships.\n\nTogether with fellow multiple-generation Superstar Ted DiBiase, Rhodes would soon look for additional guidance from another Superstar with the squared circle in his blood, Randy Orton. Under the mentorship of Orton, Cody, with Ted, joined The Viper in forming The Legacy.\n\nShortly after being voted \u201cMost Handsome Superstar\u201d in a Divas poll on WWE.com, Rhodes added the moniker \u201cDashing\u201d to his persona, showcasing a new level of self-confidence and egoism that included giving numerous good hygiene tips to the WWE Universe on how they might become more like him.\n\nThat all came crashing down, however, following an accidental facial injury in a match with Rey Mysterio. Behind a protective mask, the extremely bitter, self-conscious Rhodes began to spread his torment through WWE, eventually winning the Intercontinental Title, and restoring it to glory by reintroducing the old school look of the title and its classic gold face and medallions. Championship gold only motivated the second-generation Superstar even more, and he continued his rivalry with his former friend and mentor, Randy Orton, among others.\n\nSetting his sights on fortifying his championship pedigree, Rhodes joined forces with Damien Sandow in 2010 to forge a partnership they called Team Rhodes Scholars. Rhodes and \u201cThe Intellectual Savior of the Masses\u201d pursued the WWE Tag Team Titles, but the arrogant pair came up empty in the end.\n\nThe mustachioed Rhodes and misunderstood Sandow recently extended their circle to include The Bella Twins, which has rankled many feathers in the WWE Universe. That tension has been especially felt by the funky duo of Brodus Clay & Tensai as well as The Funkadactyls, who have taken exception to the haughty and self-centered attitudes of Team Rhodes Scholars and The Bellas. The foursomes continue to fight for supremacy, with Rhodes and his peers hoping to impose their sense of decency on their rivals.\n\nOne way or another, dashing or devious, mask or mustache, Cody Rhodes is relentless in his pursuit of a long-lasting legacy.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Cody Rhodes stats:\nHeight: 6 foot 1\nWeight: 232 pounds\nFrom: Marietta, GA\nCareer Highlights: World Tag Team Championship, Intercontinental Championship\n","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Marietta","state":"GA","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":23687,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"7668819751","name":"Cody Rhodes - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Cody-Rhodes-WWE-Universe\/7668819751","likes":498196,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150908640964752","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/428503_10150908640964752_77649477_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

He might just as easily have come from the Pakistani pace stable: well-built, quick and unfazed by a batsman's reputation, Zaheer could move the ball both ways off the wicket and swing the old ball at some pace. After initially struggling to establish himself as a new-ball bowler, he came of age on the 2002 tour of the West Indies, when he led the line with great heart. His subsequent displays in England and New Zealand - not to mention some eye-catching moments at the World Cup - established him at the forefront of India's new pace generation, but a hamstring injury saw him relegated to bit-part performer as Indian cricket scripted some of its finest moments away in Australia and Pakistan. After that, his pace has dropped and his attitude was questioned, as a new breed of pace bowlers pushed him aside to move to the front of the queue. Zaheer's response was to head to Worcestershire and take 78 wickets in the 2006 county season, a performance that earned him a recall for the tour of South Africa. He was the perfect foil for Sreesanth there, and he then regained his status as leader of the pack with a matchwinning display at Trent Bridge, as India won only their fifth Test on English soil.

{"about":"The Official Facebook page of Ian Thorpe","bio":"Ian Thorpe won five Olympic gold medals, the greatest total of any Australian. Thorpe first grabbed world attention when he won the 1998 world 400m freestyle title in Perth, becoming, at 15, the youngest world champion in history. At the age of 12, he competed in 13 events at a state meet, and set under-age NSW records in all of them. Fully grown, he had a large frame, an arm span of 190cm and size 17 feet. \n\nAs his first Olympics approached, in Sydney, he had broken 10 world records - four of them in four days at the 1999 Pan Pacific titles. On the first night of Olympic competition in Sydney he won the 400m freestyle, shaving his own world mark, then combined with Michael Klim, Chris Fydler and Ashley Callus to inflict the United States\u2019 first defeat ever in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay, setting another world record. In the individual 200m freestyle, the Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband beat him into second place. Later Thorpe featured with Klim, Todd Pearson and Bill Kirby in another world-record relay victory winning the 4 x 200m.   \n\nBetween the Sydney and Athens 2004 Games, Thorpe split with his veteran coach Doug Frost and joined Tracey Menzies. He almost lost the chance to defend his 400m title when he toppled from his starting block in the Olympic trials - but survived and went on to win the Olympic final. He later won the 200m freestyle - billed as \u201cthe race of the century\u201d - against Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband and American Michael Phelps.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":143,"username":"IanThorpeOfficial","were_here_count":0,"id":"313758558704123","name":"Ian Thorpe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/IanThorpeOfficial","likes":123661,"cover":{"cover_id":386677018078943,"source":"http:\/\/sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/s720x720\/63689_386677018078943_974621423_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Those fleeting performances were enough to earn him call-ups at England Under-21 level, and catch the eye of United scouts who identified him as a talent too good to miss out on. The Reds agreed terms with Fulham for Smalling\u2019s signature in January 2010, although the Greenwich-born defender remained at Craven Cottage for the remainder of the season. \n\nAt the time, Sir Alex Ferguson described Smalling as \u201can extremely talented young defender who we\u2019ve been monitoring for some months. He\u2019s very quick and reads the game well. He will be a great asset to the club, playing alongside some of the best defenders around and we\u2019re delighted to have secured his signature.\u201d\n\nSmalling has been a regular feature in the England U21 back-line, and has impressed greatly when called upon this season for Manchester United.\n\n\"We are very pleased with his performances.

Chandidas ran a flourishing print business and was one of the richest men in the city. Ganguly had a luxurious childhood and was nicknamed the 'Maharaja', meaning the 'Great King'. Since the favourite sport for the people of Calcutta was the game of football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not very supportive of Ganguly taking up cricket or any other sport as a career.By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team. He supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays. Ganguly was studying in tenth grade at that time.\nDespite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so he could use his brother's sporting equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he was enrolled in a cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under\u201315 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way.However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.\n\n1990\u201396: Career beginning and debut success\n\n\nFollowing a prolific Ranji season in 1990\u201391, Ganguly scored three runs in his One Day International (ODI) debut for India against the West Indies in 1992.[3][14] He was dropped immediately since he was perceived to be \"arrogant\" and his attitude towards the game was openly questioned. It was rumored that Ganguly refused to carry drinks for his teammates, commenting that it was not his job to do so, later denied by him. Consequently, he was removed from the team.[6][11] He toiled away in domestic cricket, scoring heavily in the 1993\u201394 and 1994\u201395 Ranji seasons.[15][16] Following an innings of 171 in the 1995\u201396 Duleep Trophy, he was recalled to the National team for a tour of England in 1996, in the middle of intense media scrutiny.[17] He played in a single ODI,[18] but was omitted from the team for the first Test. However, after teammate Navjot Singh Sidhu left the touring, citing ill-treatment by then captain Mohammad Azharuddin,[19][20] Ganguly made his Test debut against England in the Second Test of a three-match series at Lord's Cricket Ground alongside Rahul Dravid.[21] England had won the First Test of the three-match series; however, Ganguly scored a century, becoming only the third cricketer to achieve such a feat on debut at Lord's, after Harry Graham and John Hampshire. Andrew Strauss and Matt Prior have since accomplished this feat, but Ganguly's 131 still remains the highest by any batsman on his debut at the ground.[20] India was not required to bat in the second innings due to the match ending in a draw.[22] In the next Test match at Trent Bridge he made 136, thus becoming only the third batsman to make a century in each of his first two innings (after Lawrence Rowe and Alvin Kallicharran). He shared a 255 run stand with Sachin Tendulkar, which became at that time the highest partnership for India against any country for any wicket outside India. The Test again ended in a draw, handing England a 1\u20130 series victory; Ganguly scored 48 in the second innings.[23][24]\n1997\u201399: Marriage, Opening in ODIs and World Cup '99\n\n\nWeeks after his successful tour of England, Ganguly eloped with childhood sweetheart Dona Roy. The bride and groom's family were sworn enemies at that point and this news caused an uproar between them. However, both families reconciled and a formal wedding was held in February 1997.[6][25] Same year, Ganguly scored his maiden ODI century by hitting 113, opposed to Sri Lanka's team total of 238. Later that year, he won four consecutive man of the match awards, in the Sahara Cup with Pakistan; the second of these was won after he took five wickets for 16 runs off 10 overs, his best bowling in an ODI. After a barren run in Test cricket his form returned at the end of the year with three centuries in four Tests all against Sri Lanka two of these involved stands with Sachin Tendulkar of over 250.[3]\nDuring the final of the Independence Cup at Dhaka in January 1998, India successfully chased down 315 off 48 overs, and Ganguly won the Man of the Match award.[26] In March 1998 he was part of the Indian team that defeated Australia; in Kolkata, he took three wickets having opened the bowling with his medium pace.[27]\nGanguly was part of the Indian team that competed in the 1999 Cricket World Cup in England. During the match against Sri Lanka at Taunton, India chose to bat. After Sadagoppan Ramesh was bowled, Ganguly scored 183 from 158 balls, and hit 17 fours and seven sixes. It became the second highest score in World Cup history and the highest by an Indian in the tournament. His partnership of 318 with Rahul Dravid is the highest overall score in a World Cup and is the second highest in all ODI cricket.[28][29] In 1999\u201300, India lost Test series to both Australia and South Africa that involved a combined total of five Tests.[30][31] Ganguly struggled scoring 224 runs at 22.40; however his ODI form was impressive, with five centuries over the season taking him to the top of the PwC One Day Ratings for batsmen.[32] Around the same time, allegations came that Ganguly was romantically involved with South Indian actress Nagma, something he denied.[33]\n\n2000\u201305: Ascension to captaincy and accolades\n\n\nIn 2000, after the match fixing scandal by some of the players of the team,[34] Ganguly was named the Captain of the Indian cricket team. The decision was spurred due to Tendulkar stepping down from the position for his health, and Ganguly being the vice-captain at that time.[6] He began well as a captain, leading India to a series win over South Africa in the five-match one day series and led the Indian team to the finals of the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy.[6] He scored two centuries, including one in the final; however, New Zealand still won by four wickets.[35] The same year, Ganguly tried his hand at County cricket career in England but was not a successful.[36] In \"The Wisden Cricketer\", reviewers Steve Pittard and John Stern called him as \"The imperious Indian\u2014dubbed 'Lord Snooty'\". They commented:\n\"At the crease it was sometimes uncertain whether his partner was a batsman or a batman being dispatched to take his discarded sweater to the pavilion or carry his kit bag. But mutiny was afoot among the lower orders. In one match Ganguly, after reaching his fifty, raised his bat to the home balcony, only to find it deserted. He did not inspire at Glamorgan or Northamptonshire either. At the latter in 2006 he averaged 4.80 from his four first-class appearances.\"[37]\nHis Lancashire teammate Andrew Flintoff thought him to be aloof and compared his attitude to that of Prince Charles.[9] In Australia's three Test and five match ODI tour of India in early 2001, Ganguly caused controversy by arriving late for the toss on four occasions, something that agitated opposing captain Steve Waugh.[38] In the Fourth ODI, he caused further controversy by failing to wear his playing attire to the toss, something considered unusual in cricket circles.[39] However, India won the Test series 2\u20131, ending Australia's run of 16 consecutive Test match victories in the Second Test.[40] The match saw India looking set for defeat after conceding a first innings lead of 274. Waugh chose to enforce the follow-on and V. V. S. Laxman (281) and Rahul Dravid (180) batted for the entire fourth day's play to set Australia a target of 384 on a dusty, spinning wicket. The Australians were unable to survive and became only the third team to lose a Test after enforcing the follow-on.[41][42][43] In November 2001, Ganguly's wife Dona gave birth to their daughter Sana Ganguly.[6] At the Border-Gavaskar Trophy of 2001, During the final match of the 2002 Natwest Trophy held in Lords after a stunning performance by team mates Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif, Ganguly took off his shirt in public and brandished it in the air to celebrate India's winning of the match.[44] He was later strongly condemned for tarnishing the \"gentleman's game\" image of cricket and disrespecting Lords protocol. Ganguly said that he was only mimicking an act performed by the British all-rounder Andrew Flintoff during a tour of India.[45] In 2003, India reached the World Cup Final for the first time since 1983, where they lost to the Australians.[46] Ganguly had a successful tournament personally, scoring 465 runs at an average of 58.12, including three centuries.[47]\nBy 2004, he had achieved significant success as captain and was deemed as India's most successful cricket captain by sections of the media. However, his individual performance deteriorated during his captaincy reign, especially after the World Cup, the tour of Australia in 2003 and the Pakistan series in 2004.[48][49] In 2004, Australia won a Test series in India for the first time since 1969. It was speculated that Ganguly was in disagreement with the head of cricket in Nagpur over the type of pitch to be used for the Third Test. The groundsmen went against Ganguly, leaving a large amount of grass on the pitch. Some experts indicated that the reason for this was for \"spite or revenge\" against the Indian captain. When Australia's stand-in-captain, Adam Gilchrist, went to the toss, he noticed Rahul Dravid was waiting instead of Ganguly, leaving him to ask Dravid where Ganguly was. Dravid could not give a definitive answer, saying: \"Oh, who knows?\"[38][50]\nFollowing indifferent form in 2004 and poor form in 2005, he was dropped from the team in October 2005.[51] Having been nominated and rejected in 2000, when the game suffered a tarnished reputation due to match fixing scadals,[34] the captaincy was passed to Dravid, his former deputy. Ganguly decided against retiring and attempted to make a comeback to the team.[11] Ganguly was awarded the Padma Shri in 2004, one of India's highest awards. He was presented with the award on June 30, 2004, by then President of India, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.[52][53]\n2006\u201307: Comeback and rift with Greg Chappell\n\nMain article: Chappell Ganguly controversy\n\n\nIn September 2005, Greg Chappell became the coach for the India tour of Zimbabwe. Ganguly's dispute with him resulted in many headlines. Chappell had emailed the Board of Control for Cricket in India, stating that Ganguly was \"physically and mentally\" unfit to lead India and that his \"divide and rule\" behaviour was damaging the team.[11] This email was leaked to the media and resulted in huge backlash from Ganguly's fans. Ganguly had enlisted the support from the Indian media and eventually the board had to intervene and order a truce between the pair.[11] BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra issued a statement that,\n\"In view of the decision that cricket is to go forward, both the coach and the captain have been asked to work out a mutual and professional working relationship. For this, performance will be the criteria, applicable to captain, coach and players. [...] Of course the captain controls the game, the coach does his own job. Mutual trust is important. Henceforth no player\/captain\/coach will write or have any interaction with the media. Going to the media will lead to disciplinary action.\"[54]\nGanguly, Chappell and the Indian team manager for the Zimbabwe tour, Amitabh Choudhary, were asked to appear before the BCCI committee, where it was reported that assurance of working together was given by them.[54] Consequently, due to his poor form and differences with the coach, Ganguly was dropped as the captain of the team, with Dravid taking his place.[55] Chandresh Narayan, chief correspondent for The Times of India, commented that \"The row with Greg Chappell just added to the mystery, but he was going through a really bad patch then, his only score [of note] was a hundred against Zimbabwe and that didn't count for much.\"[11] Ten months later, during India's tour to South Africa, Ganguly was recalled after his middle order replacements Suresh Raina and Mohammad Kaif suffered poor form.[56]\nFollowing India's poor batting display in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy[57] and the ODI series in South Africa, in which they were whitewashed 4-0,[58] Ganguly made his comeback to the Test team.[59] Wasim Jaffer, Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble had earlier been selected for the one-day squad, despite their recent poor performances.[60] Many saw this as an indictment of coach Greg Chappell's youth-first policy.[61] Coming in at 37\/4, Ganguly scored 83 in a tour match against the rest of South Africa, modifying his original batting style and taking a middle-stump guard,[62] resulting in India winning the match.[63] During his first Test innings since his comeback, against South Africa in Johannesburg his score of 51 helped India to victory, marking the first Test match win for the team in South Africa.[64][65] Though India lost the series, Ganguly accumulated the most runs on the scoring chart.[66] After his successful Test comeback he was recalled for the ODI team, as India played host to West Indies[67] and Sri Lanka[68] in back to back ODI tournaments. In his first ODI innings in almost two years,[69] he scored a matchwinning 98.[70] He performed well in both series, averaging almost 70[69] and won the Man of the Series Award against Sri Lanka.[71]\nGanguly was alloted a place in the official team for the 2007 Cricket World Cup.[72] He was the leading scorer for India in their first round defeat against Bangladesh.[73] After India were knocked out of the tournament in the group stage, there were reports of a rift between certain members of the Indian team and Chappell. Ganguly was alleged to have ignored instructions from the team management to score quickly.[74] After Tendulkar issued a statement saying that what hurt the team most was that \"the coach has questioned our attitude\", Chappell decided not to renew his contract with the Indian team and left his post as coach, citing \"family and personal reasons\".[75] On 12 December 2007, Ganguly scored his maiden double century of his career while playing against Pakistan. He scored 239 runs in the first innings of the third and final Test match of the series. He was involved in a 300  run partnership for the fifth wicket with Yuvraj Singh.[76] Ganguly remained prolific in both Test and ODI cricket in the year 2007. He scored 1106 Test runs at an average of 61.44 (with three centuries and four fifties) in 2007 to become the second highest run-scorer in Test matches of that year after Jacques Kallis.[77] He was also the fifth highest run-scorer in 2007 in ODIs, where he scored 1240 runs at an average of 44.28.[78]\n\n2008\u2013present: Kolkata Knight Riders and retirement\n\nIn February 2008, Ganguly joined as the captain of Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) team, owned by Bollywood actor Shahrukh Khan.[79] On 18 April 2008, Ganguly led the KKR, in the IPL Twenty20 cricket match. They had a 140 run victory over Bangalore Royal Challengers captained by Rahul Dravid and owned by Vijay Mallya. Ganguly opened the innings with Brendan McCullum and scored 10 runs while McCullum remained unbeaten, scoring 158 runs in 73 balls.[80] On 1 May, in a game between the Knight Riders and the Rajasthan Royals, Ganguly made his second T20 half century, scoring 51 runs off of 39 balls at a strike rate of 130.76. In his innings, Ganguly hit four 4s and two sixes, topping the scorers list for the Knight Riders.[81]\nOn 7 July 2008, media reported that Ganguly was being projected as a candidate for the post of President of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) against his former mentor Jagmohan Dalmiya. Reports also suggested that he could run for the post of BCCI President in 2014 as East Zone's representative. Ganguly himself did not deny the reports and did not rule out any such move.[82][83] The same year in October, Ganguly announced that the Test series against Australia starting in October 2008 would be his last and stated \"[t]o be honest, I didn't expect to be picked for this series. Before coming here, [at the conference] I spoke to my team-mates and hopefully I will go out with a winning knock.\"[84] Ganguly played in every game of the four-Test series and amassed 324 runs at an average of 54.00.[85][86] While playing the second Test match of the series in Mohali, Ganguly scored his final test century. In the Fourth and final Test, with India needing one wicket to secure a victory, the Indian captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, invited Ganguly to lead the side in the field for the final time. India regained the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, winning the series 2\u20130.[87][88]\nIn May 2009, Ganguly was removed from the captaincy of the KKR for IPL 2009, and was replaced by McCullum. The decision was questioned by media and other players of the team, when KKR finished at the bottom of the ranking table with three wins and ten losses.[89] After that, television channel Zee Bangla appointed him as the host of the reality quiz show titled Dadagiri. It presented participants from the 19 districts of West Bengal, who had to answer questions posed by Ganguly.[90] By August, he was appointed the chairman of CAB's Cricket Development Committee. The job of the committee is to receive a report from the selectors at the end of every cricket season, assess the accountability of the selectors and make necessary recommendations.[91] He played for the Ranji cup in the Bengal team in October 2009.[92] Ganguly scored 110 in the match against Delhi team, and was involved in a partnership of 222 runs with Wriddhiman Saha.\nIn the third season of Indian Premier League, Ganguly was once again given the captaincy of Kolkata Knight Riders, after the team ended at the bottom in season 2. The coach John Buchanan was also replaced by new coach Dav Whatmore.

Ganguly was termed the \u2018God of the off-side\u2019 for his fluent run-scoring ways in that region. Never mind six, seven or eight fielders on the off-side, he could still pierce even the narrowest gap and score runs fluently. Ganguly is capable of demolishing bowling attacks single-handedly, and his liking for spin bowlers is well documented. He had scored over 18,000 runs in international cricket, which includes 38 hundreds, before calling it quits. While he made headlines regularly for his batting exploits, he also bowled tidy medium pace and picked up important wickets.\n\nSome felt he couldn't play the bouncer, others swore that he was God on the off-side; some laughed at his lack of athleticism, others took immense pride in his ability to galvanise a side. Sourav Ganguly's ability to polarise opinion led to one of the most fascinating dramas in Indian cricket. Yet, nobody can dispute that he was India's most successful Test captain - forging a winning unit from a bunch of talented, but directionless, individuals - and nobody can argue about him being one of the greatest one-day batsmen of all time. Despite being a batsman who combined grace with surgical precision in his strokeplay, his career had spluttered to a standstill before being resurrected by a scintillating hundred on debut at Lord's in 1996. Later that year, he was promoted to the top of the order in ODIs and, along with Sachin Tendulkar, formed one of the most destructive opening pairs in history.\n\nWhen he took over the captaincy after the match-fixing exposes in 2000, he quickly proved to be a tough, intuitive and uncompromising leader. Under his stewardship India started winning Test matches away, and put together a splendid streak that took them all the way to the World Cup final in 2003. Later that year, in Australia, an unexpected and incandescent hundred at Brisbane set the tone for the series where India fought the world's best team to a standstill. Victory in Pakistan turned him into a cult figure but instead of being a springboard for greater things, it was the peak of a slippery slope.\n\nThe beginning of the end came in 2004 at Nagpur - when his last-minute withdrawal played a part in Australia clinching the series - and things went pear shaped when his loss of personal form coincided with India's insipid ODI performances. Breaking point was reached when his differences with Greg Chappell leaked into public domain and his career was in jeopardy when India began their remarkable revival under Rahul Dravid.\n\nHis gritty 30s at Karachi, when India succumbed to a humiliating defeat in early 2006, weren't enough for him to retain his spot and some felt he would never get another chance. Others, as always, thought otherwise and they were proved right when he was included in the Test squad for the away series in South Africa in 2006-2007. He ended as the highest Indian run-scorer in that series and capped his fairytale comeback with four half-centuries on his return to ODIs. He continued his fine run in England, where he finished as the second highest scorer in Tests, and went on to slam back-to-back hundreds against Pakistan at home, the second of which was a glorious 239 in Bangalore. Ganguly was surprisingly omitted from India's ODI squad for the CB Series in Australia and has been out of contention in the one-day squad since. After a poor Test series in Sri Lanka, there were reports of him considering retirement but he was given a lifeline in the Tests against Australia at home. Two days before the first Test, he said the series would be his last.","talking_about_count":375905,"username":"SCGanguly","website":"http:\/\/www.souravganguly.co.in\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"153658407997844","name":"Sourav Ganguly","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SCGanguly","likes":1655543,"cover":{"cover_id":652877051409308,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1390549_652877051409308_628318580_n.jpg","offset_y":4,"offset_x":0}}

He spent six years of his professional career with La Liga side Valencia CF, before moving to England.\n\nChildhood and early career\n\nSilva was born in Arguinegu\u00edn, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Canary Islands to Fernando Jim\u00e9nez, a former municipal police officer and currently responsible for the safety of the Valencia CF stadium, and Eva Silva.

He stayed in Valencia's youth set-up until he was 17.\nClub career\nValencia\n\nSilva made his professional debut in 2004\u201305, with Segunda Divisi\u00f3n's SD Eibar, on loan from Valencia, playing 35 league games and scoring on five occasions. In the following season, he was again loaned, this time to Celta de Vigo, where he played 34 matches, scoring four goals. After two late substitute appearances, the first in a 2\u20130 home win over M\u00e1laga CF on 28 August 2005, Silva finished as an undisputed starter as the Galician side reached the UEFA Cup straight from the second-tier.\n\nSilva returned to Valencia in the 2006 summer, proceeding to become an automatic first-choice despite his young age (20). In two seasons combined, he only missed six matches while netting 14 goals (his first coming on 5 November 2006 in a 1\u20131 draw at RCD Espanyol). In August 2008, he prolonged his link a further five years, amidst interest of several Premier League teams.[1]\n\nAfter not having appeared in the first three months of 2008\u201309 due to a chronic ankle ailment,[2] Silva returned to the call-ups in mid-December. On 3 January 2009, he scored twice in a 3\u20131 home win over Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid,[3] still contributing with 19 matches (four goals) as the Che qualified for the Europa League.\n\nIn the 2009\u201310 season, Silva scored a career-best eight goals, as Valencia finished in third position and returned to the UEFA Champions League.

After college My wife and I moved back to our home town. She had gotten a Job as a RN while I had planned on finishing my degree online. Our marriage soon became strained as she was the \"bread winner\" while I was lost. I was done with football and for the first time in my life had no identity. My dream of playing in the NFL was gone and I didn't know who I was without the football player title. On top of it all I didn't get my degree and had no real intent of ever doing so. I was depressed and lacked motivation, soon my wife told me she wanted a divorce. It was this all-time low that forced me to look at my life. I hated what I saw and Vowed to change it. The only thing I had was my love for weights and I decided (as I was moving back into my parents house) to do a bodybuilding show. It gave me something to look forward to and work at every day. It took my mind off of the divorce by making me focus on the weight. I had never stopped lifting after I was done with football, but my diet was awful. I started reading up on diets on bodybuilding.com and started to cook my meals for the first time in my life. I watch tons of videos and read tons of the articles bb.com has to offer. I started a bodyspace where I was excited to see others transforming their bodies like I was. I also contacted and got help from a local bodybuilder who set up a routine that I followed for 8 weeks. At the end of those eight weeks I stepped on stage and won my class. I was new man! Going through a contest prep and winning my first competition gave me confidence that I could handle anything. I was happy to be alone, finding my own way in life. From there I enter two other bodybuilding shows. I earned my pro card in one and got second in the other. I also did a fit comp at the Bodybuilding.com fitness expo in Boise. I ended up winning and in doing so realized I wanted to become a fitness model. While living at my parents, preparing for the contests my father saw how I transformed my body through exercise and clean eating. He began to eat like I did and lost 60lb in 4 months. He says that I saved his life and he continues to live a healthy lifestyle. After the contests I decided to move back to southern Utah and finish My degree. It wasn't easy but I knew I had to. I was a biology\/psychology integrated studies major with a very tough semester ahead of me. I found that my new love for health and the body made learning Bio and Psych so much more interesting and I ended up with some of the best grades of my life. While finishing school I continued to bodybuilding and entered the Muscle & Fitness male model search at the Mr. Olympia in Las Vegas. This was a amazing event with tons of competitors. I had trained harder than ever and ended up taking 1st out of 80. It also launch my fitness modeling career as one of the prizes for winning was appearing in Muscle & Fitness. After finishing my degree I moved back home and continued to train. I had entered the annual bodyspace spokesmodel search that bodybuilding.com puts on. My hopes of making it to the final 5 came true and I went to LA where I competed and won! It was truly the best moment of my life. To become a spokesmodel of the site that helped change my life is a dream come true. I love work outing out because it's makes the rest of life seem easy. Everyday I go to the gym and put myself through hell. I know that mentally I am to handle anything life throws at me because of what I have accomplished in the gym. No one can describe in words what it's like to be completely exhausted from a intense workout, it's this feeling of accomplishment when I'm done that no one can take from me.","personal_interests":"Helping other achieve there fitness and health goals","talking_about_count":3426,"username":"SteveCookFitness","website":"www.stevecookhealth.com http:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/stevecook_32 http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/fitbody208?feature=mhum http:\/\/bodyspace.bodybuilding.com\/stevecook_32\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"121220611232763","name":"Steve Cook Fan Page","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SteveCookFitness","likes":111982,"cover":{"cover_id":614279108593575,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc1\/s720x720\/1002512_614279108593575_646157025_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

However his natural development persuaded him to pursue bodybuilding. Despite this he is on record as regarding himself as a \"martial artist first, a bodybuilder second.\" (1) It also accounts for his remarkable flexibility in a physique so large. Even so, he has been described by Arnold Schwarzenegger as one of the greatest bodybuilders he ever saw.[2]\nAfter a short career as a police officer, Wheeler focused full time on becoming a professional bodybuilder, taking the nickname 'Flex'. He competed for the first time in 1983 but it was not until 1989 that he secured a first-place trophy at the NPC Mr California Championships. Since then, he has placed second at the 1993 Mr. Olympia, narrowly missing a win (something he was to repeat in 1998 and 1999). He is a 5 time Ironman Pro winner, 4 time Arnold Classic winner, and has enjoyed victories in the France Grand Prix, South Beach Pro Invitational, Night of Champions and Hungarian Grand Prix.\nWhile Wheeler had the reputation of being arrogant and over-confident, especially on stage, he has attributed these faults to a need to compensate for his natural introversion as a child and young man. (2)\nIn 1994 he was involved in a near-fatal car accident that could have left him with lifelong paralysis. He started from scratch again, returning with remarkable speed to the top ranks of the sport.\nIn 1999 Wheeler discovered that he had Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, a form of kidney disease. Despite press speculation as to the cause of the failure, Wheeler pointed out that the condition is hereditary, not self-inflicted. Wheeler announced his retirement from competitive bodybuilding in 2000, but continued to compete until 2002. He received a kidney transplant in 2003.\nSince retirement Wheeler has focused again on martial arts, his specialism being Kemp-Kwon-Do, a variant of Kempo and Tae Kwon Do. He participated in a demonstration fight at the 2005 Arnold Classic.\nIn 2007, Flex was interviewed by freelance journalist Rod Labbe for Ironman Magazine's LEGENDS OF BODYBUILDING series. Entitled \"Yesterday and Today,\" it covers his extensive career and reveals how a Legend can conquer adversity and triumph against incredible odds.\nFlex currently serves in an executive position as the Director of Media and Public Relations for the Sports Nutrition Company All American EFX, based out of Bakersfield, California. Additionally, he manages their sponsored athletes and can be seen in numerous advertisements for the company. Flex also has a half brother living in Saint Petersburg Florida named Kenneth Wheeler who is a retired CIA operative.","personal_interests":"Height: 5'9\"[1]\nOff Season Weight: Around 250-260lbs.[1]\nCompetition Weight: Around 210-220 lbs.[1]\n[edit]Competitive history\n\n1985 AAU Teen Mr America 1st (MT)\n1989 NPC California Championships 1st (LHW)\n1989 NPC Nationals 5th (LHW)\n1990 NPC Junior Nationals 2nd (HW)\n1991 NPC Nationals 2nd (HW)\n1991 NPC USA Championship 2nd (HW)\n1992 NPC USA Championships 1st (HW and Overall)\n1993 IFBB Ironman Pro Invitational 1st\n1993 IFBB Arnold Classic 1st\n1993 IFBB Mr. Olympia 2nd\n1995 IFBB Ironman Pro Invitational 1st\n1995 IFBB Arnold Classic 2nd\n1995 IFBB South Beach Pro 1st\n1995 IFBB Mr. Olympia 8th\n1995 IFBB Grand Prix Spain 5th\n1996 IFBB Ironman Pro Invitational 1st\n1996 IFBB Arnold Classic 2nd\n1996 IFBB Night of Champions 1st\n1996 IFBB Canada Pro Classic 2nd\n1996 IFBB Florida Cup Pro 1st\n1996 IFBB Mr. Olympia 4th\n1997 IFBB Ironman Pro Invitational 1st\n1997 IFBB Arnold Classic 1st\n1997 IFBB San Jose Pro 1st\n1998 IFBB Ironman Pro Invitational 1st\n1998 IFBB Arnold Classic 1st\n1998 IFBB Mr Olympia 2nd\n1999 IFBB Grand Prix England - 2nd\n1999 IFBB Joe Weider's Pro World 2nd\n1999 IFBB Mr. Olympia 2nd\n2000 IFBB Mr. Olympia 3rd\n2000 IFBB Hungarian Grand Prix 1st\n2000 IFBB Arnold Classic 1st\n2000 IFBB Ironman Pro Invitational 2nd\n\n\nKenneth Wheeler\nPersonal Info\nNickname\tSultan of Symmetry\nBirth\tAugust 23, 1965 (age 44), Fresno, California, United States\nHeight\t5'9\" [1]\nWeight\t(In Season) 210-225 lbs.(106 kg)\n(Off-Season) 265-275 lbs.

He is the only child of Diane Johnson, the person he calls the most influential person in his life.  Joe declined scholarship offers from traditional college basketball powerhouses like Duke and Connecticut in order to play for his favorite childhood team, the Arkansas Razorbacks.  While playing for the Razorbacks, Joe led the team in scoring (averaging 16.0 points per game) and rebounding (averaging 5.7 rebounds per game), becoming the first freshman in the school's history to lead the team in both.\n\nAfter playing two seasons at the University of Arkansas, Joe was selected 10th overall by the Boston Celtics in the 2001 NBA Draft.  Joe started 33 of Boston's first 38 games as a rookie, but his playing time dwindled as the Celtics made a push for the NBA Playoffs for the first time since 1995.  Midway through his rookie season, Johnson was traded to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nJoe became a force with Phoenix, as he averaged 15.2 points per game in his three and a half seasons with the Suns.  He also developed into one of the most lethal three-point shooters in the NBA.  He is notorious for his great ball-handling ability considering his size and for his jump shot.\n \nIn the summer of 2005, Joe became a highly touted restricted free agent and expressed a desire to leave the Suns to assume a larger role on the Atlanta Hawks.  On August 19, 2005, a deal was finalized and Joe was involved in a sign-and-trade deal with the Hawks for Boris Diaw and two future first-round draft picks.\n\nIn his first season as a Hawk (2005-06), Joe led the Atlanta Hawks in several categories: points (20.2 per game), assists (6.5), steals (1.26), three-point field goals made (128), and minutes (40.7).  He was one of only five players in the league to average at least 20 points and six assists in the 2005-06 season.  Joe was the only Hawk to play in all 82 games. \n\nIn the summer of 2006, Joe played for the U.S. national team in the 2006 FIBA World Championship, winning a bronze medal.  He continued his NBA development in the 2006\u201307 season, when he averaged 25.0 points, 4.4 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.05 steals per game.  His 25.0 scoring average was behind only Allen Iverson among qualifying NBA guards, and ninth-best overall.  Joe also shot a career-best 47.1\u0025 from the field.  In recognition of his efforts, League Commissioner David Stern named Joe to the 2007 Eastern Conference All-Star team.\n\nDuring the 2007-08 season, Joe again made the All-Star Game as a reserve.  He also was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice during the season.  Joe averaged 21.7 points per game on the season, leading the Hawks to their first playoff appearance in 9 years.  In Game 4 of the Hawks' first-round matchup against the Boston Celtics, Joe scored 35 points, including 20 in the 4th quarter, leading the Hawks to a 97-92 victory.  However, the Hawks went on to lose the series four games to three.\n\nSo far in the 2008-09 season, Joe has the Hawks off to a great start.  In fact, they are in position to be a contender for the NBA Championship.  Joe is currently averaging 22.3 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game.\n\nWhen not playing basketball, Joe enjoys bowling, football, and going to movies.  He is also interested in giving back to the community, mainly through donations and events that benefit the children in the Atlanta community.","talking_about_count":545,"username":"joejohnson","were_here_count":0,"id":"58387473216","name":"Joe Johnson","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/joejohnson","likes":150439}

Being in my late 20s\u2019 I was ready to retire to a lasting wardrobe of sweats, elastic-waistband pants and flabby dresses.\nMy story is no different from any other new mom who is struggling with her baby weight right now!!!\nLet me start by sharing my childhood memories of my very supportive mom, who always encouraged me and my sister to be physically active.  Hence, she would give us an opportunity to enjoy ballet, gymnastics, and ballroom dancing. She would always quote: \u201cMovement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states\u201d.  ~Carol Welch  Reading my story you will learn that she came to my rescue and gave me the chance to be reborn again!\nThe year 2004 was full of many transitions. I moved to Canada and had my son and year and a half later I had my little princess. Through my both pregnancies I gained over 50 lb each time that made my life pretty depressing. I felt mentally heavy. Life changes affect each of us differently, I found comfort in food!    I became OVERWEIGHT, UNHAPPY WITH MY BODY, UNFIT, UNCONFIDENT, INSECURE mom. More important I lost my spirit! I knew that the change had to be made but I didn\u2019t have the energy and knowledge and motivation to add one more thing to my already full plate! \nIt was my Birthday, when my family gave me a membership card to one of the local gyms saying \u201c enough is enough, this is the day of you being re-born\u201d  I remember my grandma and mom always saying if you don\u2019t take care of yourself, how can you take care of anyone else? If you don\u2019t care about yourself think about your kids! I was officially tired of angling my body behind my kids and friends  or furniture so I can appear slimmer on every picture that will be a part of my family photo album!  I was embarrassed of not being able to go for a run with my son, because my own body was suffocating me!  That is how my journey to my transformation began!!!! \nDuring my first visit at the gym I spotted a few fitness models that were training at the same facility and felt more like a spy hiding behind the equipment , observing and imitating their routine. \u201cIt is impossible!\u201d I thought. It always seems impossible until it\u2019s done. It is funny how we tell ourselves so many things that keep us from being our best. It is so easy to fall into false belief about who we are! Have you ever noticed how we make ourselves to believe that we can\u2019t make that first push up or pull up? But if someone will gently pretend to help you lift your body, miraculously, you find the strength within yourself to do what seemed to be impossible! We all have ability within us but we are not allowing ourselves to believe that we can!   After numerous sprints up and down my neighbourhood, push up, jumps, burpees, squats, lunges. I would get nauseous! That was a very good way not to eat. I started a transformation of my eating habits along with my body. I educated myself about healthy eating and benefits of the food I consume every day.  I finally started to notice the benefits of my goal: I feel healthier, lighter physically and emotionally. \nWe all have a story we tell ourselves: \u201c  I will never be able to lose weight!\u201d, \u201c I was this way all my life and it is too late to change\u201d, \u201c I am too old\u201d, \u201c I don\u2019t have time!\u201d, \u201cDiet is not for me!\u201d, \u201cI am weak\u201d etc. I read somewhere if your fantasies are your own, why not make them the great once?\nNow I am proud to say that I am 50 pounds lighter and back to my pre-pregnancy weight. My dream of being fitness\/Bikini model after having two kids being a single mom came true! I am strong. I won my confidence back! I want to live my life healthier and to the fullest. I am alive!!! \nIf you ask me what keeps me going?  Hands down, my kids and people who fallow and support me in my fitness career.  People that I inspired and I motivated by  sharing my story and showing my progress to change their eating habits, be more active, start involving our kids in our workouts, and simply take control over their health!\nThe only exercise some people get is jumping to conclusions, running down their friends, side-stepping responsibility, and pushing their luck! \n\n\nhttp:\/\/twitter.com\/#!\/olyahaidner\nhttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/106779415309062711009","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Canada, United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":7911,"username":"bodybyolya","website":"http:\/\/www.olyahaidner.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"193620497325538","name":"Body by Olya","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bodybyolya","likes":217357,"cover":{"cover_id":570095686344682,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/431919_570095686344682_1372957298_n.jpg","offset_y":8,"offset_x":0}}

Joe.\n\nRyan refined his athletic skills on the soccer pitch, competing in the semi-pro Welsh Premier League. However, influenced by Superstars such as Andre the Giant, The Ultimate Warrior and The Undertaker, Ryan eventually traded soccer for WWE, where he could better satisfy his indomitable thirst for flattening his foes.\n\nWith an aggressive in-ring style, relentless determination and unmistakably impressive physique, Ryan caught the eye of the calculating CM Punk, who recruited the juggernaut to his New Nexus. Ryan debuted during the Jan. 17, 2011 edition of Monday Night Raw, dismantling John Cena and effectively putting the entire WWE Universe on notice.\n\nWith the dissolution of New Nexus, Mason Ryan came back to WWE more focused and stronger \u2013 if that\u2019s even possible.

Park is able to play anywhere across the midfield and is noted for his exceptional fitness level, discipline, work ethic and off-the-ball movement.Park began his football career in his native South Korea and played for the Myongji University team before moving to Japan to play for Kyoto Purple Sanga. After Park's national team manager Guus Hiddink moved back to the Netherlands to manage PSV Eindhoven, Park followed him to the Dutch side a year later. After PSV reached the semi-finals of the 2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League, Park's talents were recognised by Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and he signed Park for a fee of around \u00a34\u00a0million in July 2005.

Silva is known for his aggressive fighting style with the majority of his fights ending in knockout or referee stoppage due to strikes.\n\ufeff\n\u200bEarly career\nSilva's aggressive style is rooted in street brawling, refined with elements of Muay Thai and kickboxing. As a late teen he joined the military and was quickly recognized for his fighting talents and rose up in the ranks. Silva enlisted after already winning fight tournaments in his age group in Brazil.[2]\nSilva's first professional match was on November 1, 1996, in the Brazilian Vale Tudo Fighting organization (BVF), where he knocked out Dilson Filho via strikes at BVF 6. He fought in one other match in BVF, BVF 10 on July 1, 1997, against Marcelo Barbosa, who submitted due to a shoulder injury.\nSilva fought six matches in four different IVC events, IVC 2, IVC 6, IVC 9 and IVC 10, from 1997 to 1999. He won five of these matches by KO\/TKO, with his one loss being the result of a cut stoppage against Artur Mariano in the IVC 2 show on September 15, 1997. The cut was above his left eyelid and opened back up several times, partially because Silva continued to use the cut side of his head to inflict many headbutts on Mariano over the course of the match.[3] The doctor observed the cut several times before the fight was ended.[3]\nSilva culminated his IVC career by winning the promotion's light heavyweight belt with a submission win over Eugene Jackson in the IVC 10 show on April 27, 1999.\nIt was after this fight that Silva earned the nickname \"The Axe Murderer\".","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"4631 South Dean Martin Drive","city":"Las Vegas","state":"NV","country":"United States","zip":"89102"},"phone":"(702) 538-8300","talking_about_count":6053,"username":"wanderleisilvaoficial","website":"http:\/\/www.wandfc.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"594427080591991","name":"Wanderlei Silva","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wanderleisilvaoficial","likes":248369,"cover":{"cover_id":618634258171273,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash4\/s720x720\/1146616_618634258171273_807404879_n.jpg","offset_y":9,"offset_x":0}}

Kevin made his debut for Natal Cricket Club in 1997 before moving to England to further his opportunities for playing at International level. His English Mother gave Pietersen eligibility to play for England, and after serving a qualifying period of four years playing at county level, he was called up immediately into the England national side.\n\nHe made his England Lions debut in 2004 where he averaged 104 in 3 innings on tour in Zimbabwe and followed this with 3 centuries in 5 innings against South Africa in 2005 for the senior team.\nHis phenomenal talent and self belief can never have been more evident than hitting 158 on the final day of the last test at the Oval in the 2005 Ashes, securing England a first Ashes triumph in 18 years.\n\nHe has a highest test score of 227, averages over 50 in test matches, and is one of the fastest ever English batsmen to reach 4000 test runs. His incredible reverse sweep for 6 off Muralitharan at Edgbaston has developed into his trademark switch hit, another element of his game that keeps him in the highest echelons of World Class Batsmen.\n\nIn 2009 KP became one of the World\u2019s most expensive cricketers in the IPL auction, playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore. In 2010 KP was named player of the tournament on the way to helping England win the ICC World T20. KP was again instrumental in the team effort, hitting 227 In Adelaide in 2010 when England eventually went on to win the Ashes, making KP a 3 time Ashes winner.

His most notable innings came for the Under-19s against England at the end of 2005 when he smashed 112 from just 71 balls to help Bangladesh cruise to victory. He played in the 2006 U-19 Cricket World Cup in Sri Lanka. He plays his first-class cricket for Chittagong Division cricket team and has also played for Old DOHS as an opener in the Corporate League. Tamim Iqbal is the brother of Test player Nafees Iqbal and the nephew of Akram Khan, another famous cricketer from Bangladesh. The left-hander is regarded as one of the most exciting prospects in Bangladesh cricket and is arguably the hardest hitter of the cricket ball in the country. His elegance and style through the off side is a treat to watch but his trademark shot is the straight drive, capped with a text-book like follow-through. He made his one-day debut against Zimbabwe in February 2007 and was included in the World Cup squad after playing just two matches. He played his first world cup match against India in the group stage of the competition, scoring 51 runs from 53 deliveries, helping his team win the match. His straight six off Zaheer Khan after chipping down the track was one of the best shots of the tournament. He scored a stylish 84 in his debut Test, against New Zealand in Dunedin and has established his spot at the top of the order. On Bangladesh's tour of the West Indies in July and August 2009, Tamim scored his maiden Test century. Against a West Indies team weakened by disputes between players and administrators which resulted in seven players making their Test debut in the match, Tamim's effort with the bat helped Bangladesh to a historic victory - their s first against the West Indies in Tests, their first overseas Test victory, and only their second Test win.\n\nHe ended up with 128, and was named as the Man of the Match for his performance (he also scored 33 in the first innings). Speaking of his innings, Tamim said \"It was a flat wicket, and if you concentrate hard and look to bat straight, it's a good track to score on. I'm just 20 and have played only 11 Tests, I think there are a lot more [innings like these] to come\".\nTamim set another national record in ODI against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo when he blasted an 154 in a tall chase.\nBangladesh's coach, Jamie Siddons, opined in January 2010, before the Tri-Series in Bangladesh in 2009\u201310 with Sri Lanka and India, that Iqbal had \"the makings of a world-class opener\".\nOn 25 January, 2010 Tamim Iqbal scored 151 in a record partnership with Junaid Siddique against India. On 13 March 2010, in the course of an innings of 86 in his first Test against England, he became the third-youngest player in Test history (behind Sachin Tendulkar and compatriot Mohammad Ashraful) to reach 1,000 Test runs. Tamim has found England's bowling attack particularly to his liking, and a superb run of form against them in two series, home and away, lead to five scores of more than fifty in six Test innings, culminating in his stunning 103 at Lord's in May 2010.He would then go on to score another century in the first innings of the second Test in the two-match series in England scoring 108 respectively.\nHard hitting dashing opener Tamim Iqbal Khan became the first Bangladeshi cricketer to be named as International player of the month (May 2010) by the world's best-selling monthly cricket magazine Wisden. In October 2010, Tamim Iqbal was named Test player of the year by the Wisden Cricketer Magazine. Tamim beat contenders Graeme Swann and Virender Sehwag who came second and third.\nIn December 2010, Tamim Iqbal replaced Mushfiqur Rahim as Bangladesh's vice-captain for year 2011.\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.prothom-alo.com\/detail\/date\/2012-03-17\/news\/233140","birthday":"03\/20\/1989","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Chittagong","country":"Bangladesh","zip":""},"personal_info":"Full name : Tamim Iqbal Khan (\u09a4\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09ae \u0987\u0995\u09ac\u09be\u09b2 \u0996\u09be\u09a8).\nBorn: March 20, 1989, Chittagong\n\nMajor teams: Bangladesh, Asia XI, Bangladesh A, Bangladesh Under-19s, Chittagong Division\n\nBatting style: Left-hand bat\n\nBowling style: Slow Right-arm orthodox (Part Time)\n\nRelation: Uncle - Akram Khan, Brother - Nafees Iqbal \n\nTest debut : New Zealand v Bangladesh at Dunedin, Jan 4-6, 2008.\n\nODI debut : Zimbabwe v Bangladesh at Harare, Feb 9, 2007.\n\nTwenty\/20 debut : Kenya v Bangladesh at Nairobi, Sep 1, 2007.\n\nHighest Run: 151(in Test), 154 (in ODI)\n\nhttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Tamim.Iqbal","personal_interests":"\u2714 Verified Account Official\u00ae\n\n\u00a9 Fan Page Original & Official\nhttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Tamim.Iqbal\n\u2588\u2551\u258c\u2502\u2588\u2502\u2551\u258c\u2551\u2502\u2502\u2588\u2551\u258c\u2551\u258c\u2551\n","talking_about_count":33579,"username":"Tamim.Iqbal","website":"http:\/\/www.cricinfo.com\/ci\/content\/player\/56194.html http:\/\/www.cricinfo.com\/magazine\/content\/story\/452976.html http:\/\/www.cricinfo.com\/bdeshvind2010\/content\/story\/445896.html http:\/\/www.iccreliancerankings.com\/ranking\/test\/batting\/ http:\/\/www.iccreliancerankings.com\/ranking\/odi\/batting\/ http:\/\/www.cricinfo.com\/magazine\/content\/story\/452976.html http:\/\/www.cricinfo.com\/bdeshveng2010\/content\/story\/452781.html http:\/\/www.cricinfo.com\/bdeshveng2010\/content\/story\/451851.html http:\/\/www.cricinfo.com\/bdeshveng2010\/content\/story\/450392.html http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/travel\/content\/site\/travel\/index.html?city=chittagong http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/travel\/content\/story\/485106.html?city=chittagong http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/travel\/content\/story\/497292.html","were_here_count":0,"id":"11269037660","name":"Tamim Iqbal","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Tamim.Iqbal","likes":582246,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151737992572661","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1001538_10151737992572661_499439672_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

His father Mahipal Singh Beniwal, is a bus driver with the Haryana Roadways, while his mother is a homemaker. His father drove buses overtime so as to pay for Vijender and his elder brother Manoj's education. Vijender was inspired by his elder brother Manoj, a former Boxer himself, to join the sport of boxing. After Manoj succeeded to enter into the Indian Army in 1998 with his Boxing credentials, he decided to support Vijender financially so he could continue his boxing training. Vijender's parents decided to not pressurise him to continue his studies, as they felt that he had a talent and passion for Boxing. For Vijender, Boxing quickly grew from an interest and passion to a career choice.\nHe practiced at the Bhiwani Boxing Club. The first recognition for Vijender came when he won a bout in the state level competition. In 2003, he became the all-India youth Boxing Champion. After beating a good Boxer at that time, he said in an interview that he got confidence and belief in himself as a Boxer. The turning point, however, came in the 2003 Afro-Asian Games. Despite being a junior Boxer, Vijender took part in the selection trials and was picked for the meet where he fought valiantly to win a silver medal. Vijender was picked to train and compete at several international level competitions such as the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics and the 2006 Commonwealth Games. \nAt the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, he won the Bronze Medal. At the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, he won Bronze Medal\u2014the first ever Olympic medal for an Indian Boxer.\nAfter this historic win, Vijender was felicitated with a number of awards, including the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award\u2014India's highest sporting honour. In 2009, he participated at the World Amateur Boxing Championships where he won the Bronze Medal. In the same year, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) announced Vijender as the top-ranked Boxer in its annual middleweight category list with 2800 points. He is credited for bringing back the sport of Boxing into the limelight in India.\nAt 2010 Asian Games in China,Vijender won a Gold medal by defeating two times world champion by 7-0,a real class","personal_interests":"Boxing","talking_about_count":12627,"username":"vijendersinghboxer","website":"www.vijendersinghboxer.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"154538724568206","name":"Vijender Singh","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/vijendersinghboxer","likes":230547,"cover":{"cover_id":380465175308892,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/552985_380465175308892_275808410_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"category":"Athlete","description":"Josep \"Pep\" Guardiola i Sala is a Spanish football manager and manager of German Bundesliga club Bayern Munich. Guardiola had played as a defensive midfielder and spent the majority of his playing career with FC Barcelona. He was part of Johan Cruyff's \"dream team\" that won Barcelona's first European Cup. He also played for Brescia and Roma in Italy; Al-Ahli in Qatar; and for Dorados de Sinaloa in Mexico while attending managing school. While playing in Italy, he served a four-month ban for a positive drug test, although he was cleared of wrongdoing twice on appeal in 2009 before the Courts of Justice of the Italian Football Federation and the Federal Anti-Doping Courts of the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI). As an international, he played for Spain, and in friendly matches for Catalonia.After retiring as a player, Guardiola became coach of FC Barcelona B, and mid-2008 he succeeded Frank Rijkaard as the first team manager. In his first season as manager, Bar\u00e7a won the treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey, and the Champions League. In doing so, Guardiola became the youngest UEFA Champions League-winning manager ever. The following season, Guardiola and Barcelona won the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup, bringing the manager's tally to the maximum of six trophies in six competitions in one year, thus completing six trophies sextuple in two seasons.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":354,"website":"http:\/\/www.elpais.com\/articulo\/deportes\/Guardiola\/absuelto\/segunda\/vez\/elpepudep\/20090929elpepudep_5\/Tes","were_here_count":0,"id":"110088699020288","name":"Pep Guardiola","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Pep-Guardiola\/110088699020288","likes":469905}

Visit my website http:\/\/ybafraid.com - Twitter http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/YohanBlake","awards":"2011 100m World Title - Daegu \n2012 Jamaica National Senior Champion 100m and 200m\n2012 London Olympics-  Silver Medal 100m\n2012 London Olympics - Silver Medal 200m\n2012 London Olympics - Gold Medal 4x100m Relay (team)","bio":"2013 promises to be quite a year for Yohan Blake. In August, he travels to Moscow to defend his world 100m title while on the commercial circuit he will seek to grow his reputation for producing stunning performances and enhance his reputation as one of world sport\u2019s most accomplished stars.\n\nThe 23-year-old Jamaican\u2019s meteoric rise has seen his name continually in the headlines. \n\nAt the Olympic Games in London in August, Blake claimed gold as a key member of the Jamaica relay squad which, for the second straight time at a global showpiece, broke the world record. He also won silver medals in both the 100m and 200m.\nHaving set himself the highest possible standards \u2013 and beaten his great rival and training partner Usain Bolt at both sprints at the Jamaican Olympic trials in June \u2013 the 22-year-old was probably slightly disappointed not to have crowned his first Olympics with an individual gold medal. But for Blake, 2012 was a year when he not only seemed to run faster and faster but more often too.\n\nStatistics do not lie. Blake ended the 2012 season as the second fastest man ever at both the 100m and 200m having clocked three of the fastest 11 runs ever over 100m and three of the nine quickest over 200m. \n\n2011 was the year Blake won the world title; 2012 was when he entered the pantheon of athletics greats.  \n\nFeted wherever he went in the aftermath of his performances in 2012, Blake\u2019s profile as an athlete who has transcended his sport was best illustrated shortly after the Olympics had closed by his invitation to the opening morning of the cricket Test between England and South Africa at the home of the game, Lord\u2019s in London, to ring the bell to signal the start of play.\n\nThe 100m final in London was the fastest ever Olympic sprint race with the winner clocking 9.63sec; Blake second in 9.75sec; and another adidas athlete Tyson Gay finishing fourth in 9.80sec. It was Gay\u2019s performance that perfectly illustrated the quality of the race as his time, 9.80sec, would have been good enough to win every Olympic final up to Beijing four years earlier. \n\nBlake\u2019s progress throughout the season demonstrated just why he is now regarded as one of the world\u2019s top handful of stars. At the 100m, his winning time of 9.69sec in Lausanne placed him alongside Gay as the joint second fastest ever. In all, Blake ran four of the world\u2019s six fastest 100m times in 2012 while over 200m he clocked three of the six quickest.  \n\nBlake\u2019s rise to the summit of world sprinting was a reward for years of hard work and skilful coaching. Yet it all came to fruition in the space of just 20 days in 2011\n.\n\tHe had gone into the year touted as a sprinting prodigy and the man most likely to succeed his training partner Usain Bolt on a long-term basis. But over the coming months Blake matured even faster than even his keenest followers might have predicted. In the space of just three weeks in August and September 2011 he turned the world order on its head.   \n\nIt all started on a breezy Sunday evening in South Korea and will most likely be remembered as the sporting shock of that year. The scene? The 100m final at the IAAF World Championships in Daegu when Blake ended Bolt\u2019s three-year reign of supremacy at championship level.\n\nIt was a remarkable 100m final and the triumph of the pupil over the master - both men are coached by Glen Mills. As he had done when he won this title three years ago in Berlin, breaking the world record in the process, Bolt indulged in his characteristic showboating before the race but then lost his concentration committing a false-start.\n\nThen, once the excitement among a stunned audience had died down, it was left to Blake to sprint to victory in 9.92sec despite a headwind of 1.4 metres per second. Blake finished 0.16sec ahead of the second-placer in completing a victory which was \u201cBoltesque\u201d in its dominance.\n\nSeven nights later \u2013 in fact, in the last event of the championships \u2013 Blake laid claim to the moniker \u201cathlete of the championships\u201d when he ran the third leg for the victorious Jamaica 4x100m team. Their winning time broke the world record. \nFour days later, and after a 12-hour flight to Europe, Blake hit the ground sprinting again. This time it was at the Zurich Diamond League meeting where he left a world-class field trailing in his wake as he clocked what was then a lifetime best, 9.82sec. \n\nThat was on the Thursday evening. By the end of the following Sunday, he\u2019d repeated the performance \u2013 yet another 9.82sec \u2013 this time in Berlin and on the same stretch of track on which Bolt had broken the world record two years earlier.\nYet the most stunning performance of Blake\u2019s remarkable 20 days was to come. Until the Diamond League meeting in Brussels, Blake had been regarded as a 100m specialist whose 200m potential was real but untapped and probably best left for another year. But in Brussels on September 16 he stepped well and truly out of the shadow cast by Bolt\u2019s reputation. His winning time of 19.26sec in the Belgian capital is the second fastest ever clocked for the distance. And it could have been even faster. Blake\u2019s reaction time was the slowest of the nine-man field and, remarkably, it was his first 200m race for four months. \u201cTonight I was aiming to run 19.5,\u201d Blake said. \u201cI was expecting something fast but not this fast.\n\n\u201cThe last 40 metres was crazy. I'm like a beast. I just take it out on the track. When I saw him (Usain Bolt) run 19.40 at the worlds I knew I could go fast like that.\u201d\n\nSo where has Blake come from? In terms of his development he is still in his formative years. But the record reflects that going into 2011 Blake had already gone toe-to-toe with the globe\u2019s greatest sprinters and demonstrated that he is mature beyond his years. He is mentally tough going into the race and, when the gun fires, is explosive out of the blocks. \n\nBlake, who is a member of the adidas Next Generation project, revels on the big stage. But like many of the world\u2019s elite performers he had come face-to-face with bitter disappointment. His came four years ago when he went to the IAAF World Junior Championships in Bydgoszcz as the outstanding favourite to win gold at the 100 metres. Two years earlier in Beijing, when he was just 16, he had finished third. But in the Polish town, after a smooth passage through the qualifying rounds, he was slow out of the blocks in the final and missed out on the medals altogether.\n\t\nWithin 12 months, though, Blake was sprinting half-a-second faster and leaving not only the bad memories of Bydgoszcz behind him but his rivals too.\n\n\tIn Rome in July 2009, he scorched to 9.96sec. Blake was just 19 years and 197 days. No one younger had ever broken 10 seconds. Then one week later in Paris he went faster still \u2013 this time to 9.93sec.\n\n\tMuch of the credit for Blake\u2019s development can be given to coach Mills whose Jamaica-based Racers\u2019 Club is one of two adidas-funded programmes \u2013 the other being in Florida. The Racers\u2019 Club offers an environment in which tomorrow\u2019s stars can live, eat and train alongside the Olympic and world champions of today. \n\t\nAway from the track Blake shares the sort of sporting passions that are typical of a young Jamaican. He is a keen cricketer (which made his trip to Lord\u2019s in August such a personal highlight) and takes every available opportunity to catch up with the sport at which the West Indies are past world champions. Indeed, in a charity game in Jamaica in October 2010 he claimed the prized wicket of Chris Gayle who is one of the game\u2019s most powerful and stylish batsmen. The wicket fell when Gayle mistimed a back-foot drive off Blake\u2019s bowling offering a straightforward chance to the mid-off fielder. And who was the player fielding at mid-off? None other than Usain Bolt.  \n\nFacts and figures\n\nBorn: December 26 1989, St James, Jamaica\nIAAF world 100m champion\nOlympic Games silver medallist at both the 100m and 200m\nOlympic gold medallist, world champion and world record holder at the 4x100m. \nSecond fastest man ever at both the 100m and 200m\nAt 19 years and 197 days he was the youngest man to have ever broken the 10-second barrier for 100m\nlifetime bests \u2013 100m: 9.69sec (2012); 200m: 19.26sec (\u201911)\n\nThe world\u2019s 10 fastest ever 100m runs \u2026\n\n9.58\tUsain Bolt\tBerlin, August 2009\n9.63\tBolt\tLondon, August 2012\n9.69\tBolt\tBeijing, August 2008\n9.69\tYohan Blake\tLausanne, August 2012\n9.69\tTyson Gay\tShanghai, September 2009\n9.71\tGay\tBerlin, August 2009\n9.72\tBolt\tNew York, May 2008\n9.72\tAsafa Powell\tLausanne, September 2008\n9.74\tPowell\tRieti, September 2007\n9.75\tBlake\tKingston, JAM, June 2012\n9.75\tBlake\tLondon, August 2012\n\nAnd the fastest over 200m \u2026\n\n19.19\tUsain Bolt\tBerlin, August 2009\n19.26\tYohan Blake\tBrussels, September 2011\n19.30\tBolt\tBeijing, August 2008\n19.32\tMichael Johnson, Atlanta, August 1996\n19.32\tBolt\tLondon, August 2012\n19.40\tBolt\tDaegu, September 2011\n19.44\tBlake\tLondon, August 2012\n19.53\tWalter Dix\tBrussels, September 2011\n19.54\tBlake\tBrussels, September 2012\n19.56\tBolt\tKingston, May 2010\n\nTimeline - Blake\u2019s 20-day rise to stardom in 2011\n\nAugust 28\the wins world 100m title in Daegu, clocking 9.92sec into a 1.4m\/sec wind\nSeptember 4\tBlake runs the third leg for Jamaica as they take gold and break the world record for the 4x100m in Daegu \nSeptember 8\tscorches to 100m victory at the prestigious Zurich meeting on a windless night in 9.82sec\nSeptember 11 repeats his Zurich performance in Berlin with another win in 9.82sec\nSeptember 16 stuns Brussels with the second fastest ever 200m, 19.26sec","birthday":"12\/29\/1989","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","zip":"Jamaica"},"talking_about_count":14150,"username":"YohanBlake","website":"http:\/\/www.ybafraid.com | Twitter: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/yohanblake","were_here_count":0,"id":"208312182600542","name":"Yohan Blake","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YohanBlake","likes":851814,"cover":{"cover_id":374442559320836,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc1\/s720x720\/3522_374442559320836_146151541_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

He completed the year having achieved four points scoring finishes and eight in the top eight.\n\n2002 \u2013 2006: The Mclaren Years:\nSuch was Kimi\u2019s debut that he moved to McLaren for the 2002 season as a replacement for two-time champion, Mika H\u00e4kkinen. He finished third in his debut race with the team and came close to winning the French Grand Prix. The following year Kimi won his first race, the Malaysian Grand Prix. Despite no further wins, a strong run meant he finished second in the title race, just two points adrift of Michael Schumacher. 2004 was to prove frustrating. Kimi took McLaren\u2019s only win that year at the Belgian Grand Prix. The following year he finished second to Fernando Alonso in the title race, with seven wins to his name. 2006 was to prove Kimi\u2019s final year at McLaren and the momentum did not continue from the year before, with Kimi finishing fifth in the standings.\n\n2007 \u2013 2009: Ferrari and Drivers\u2019 title:\nKimi\u2019s debut for the prancing horse was a fairytale, with pole position, fastest lap and he became the first driver since Nigel Mansell in 1989 to win on his Ferrari debut. He followed that with a further five wins, stealing the title from under the noses of the battling McLaren duo of Alonso and Lewis Hamilton at the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix. The following two seasons were more low-key, finishing third in the standings in 2008, and sixth the following season.\n\n2010 \u2013 2011: Rallying and NASCAR:\nThe FIA World Rally Championship was the destination for Kimi with the Citro\u00ebn Junior Team in 2010, with a best finish of fifth in the Rally of Turkey.

He combined his rallying with two NASCAR outings.\n\n2012 : The Return of the King\nWill Kimi\u2019s comeback make for the fitting F1 career end?\u2026 only time will tell. [ Update: Six podiums, 20\/20 finishes, two fastest laps, one race win, and finished 3rd in the championship - not bad! ]\n\n2013 \u2013 He certainly did make it a comeback worth trying\u2026 now he is hungrier than ever for a second world title!

He opened the door for a trial which ultimately proved successful for the all round athlete who also showed potential as a cricketer in his schoolboy days.\n\nAlex caught the eye in the second half the 2009\/10 campaign, his first season as a scholar. He boasts an impressive touch and turn of pace to boot, opening his goal scoring account with a well taken run and shot against Bournemouth in the reserves at Staplewood.\n\nThis led to him making his first team debut aged 16 years and 199 days with a late cameo against Huddersfield Town in a 5-0 win at the start of March 2010.\n\nHe scored on his full first team debut at St. Mary's in a 2-0 win over AFC Bournemouth in the Carling Cup just days before his 17th birthday.\n\nThere was more good news to come, as he followed that up by signing a three year professional contract with the Club a week later.\n\nOriginally a central midfielder, Chamberlain has made in-roads into the first team playing on the wing. His first league goal for the club arrived in October 2010 when he scored the winner in a 2-1 victory over Oldham Athletic, just minutes after coming off the bench in the second half of the game.\n\n(www.saintsfc.co.uk)","birthday":"08\/15\/1993","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"Emirates Stadium","city":"London","state":"","country":"United Kingdom","zip":""},"talking_about_count":223,"username":"oxladechamberlain","website":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alex_Oxlade-Chamberlain http:\/\/www.saintsfc.co.uk\/page\/ProfilesDetail\/0,,10280~50863,00.html  http:\/\/www.arsenal.com\/first-team\/players\/alex-oxlade-chamberlain","were_here_count":0,"id":"105673042800414","name":"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/oxladechamberlain","likes":164311,"cover":{"cover_id":609215172446196,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/994216_609215172446196_1366825166_n.jpg","offset_y":26,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Impressum nach \u00a7 5 TMG: http:\/\/arthur-abraham.de\/impressum\/","affiliation":"Deutsch","bio":"Mit seinem spektakul\u00e4ren Kampfstil hat der heute 31-J\u00e4hrige die Herzen der Fans im Sturm erobert \u2013 und das nicht nur in Deutschland.\n\nKeine Frage, die Schlagkraft des geb\u00fcrtigen Armeniers hat Eindruck hinterlassen. Mit dem Sieg in der \u201eSchlacht von Wetzlar\u201d ging Abraham in die Box-Geschichte ein: Obwohl er acht Runden mit doppelt gebrochenem Kiefer durchstehen musste, besiegte er Edison Miranda im September 2006 klar nach Punkten. \u201eEin Mann muss auch Schmerzen ertragen k\u00f6nnen\u201d, sagte Abraham damals. \u201eIch habe lieber Schmerzen und den WM-G\u00fcrtel als nur die Schmerzen.\u201d Zwei Titanplatten und 22 Schrauben halten seither seinen Kiefer zusammen, was oftmals ungl\u00e4ubige Blicke des Flughafensicherheitspersonals nach sich zieht. \u201eWenn ich irgendwo hinfliege, habe ich sicherheitshalber immer eine R\u00f6ntgenaufnahme dabei\u201d, lacht der Champion. Und sp\u00e4testens seit seinem K.o.- Sieg \u00fcber Edison Miranda im sog. \u201eRevanche\u201c \u2013 Kampf im Juni 2008 in Hollywood (Florida), als Arthur ihn allein in der vierten Runde gleich dreimal zu Boden schickte, ist Abraham auch in den USA bekannt.\n\nZehnmal verteidigte Abraham seinen Titel im Mittelgewicht. Als ungeschlagener Champion legte er seinen Weltmeistertitel nieder, um in das Super-Mittelgewicht zu wechseln und sich im Rahmen des \u201eSuper-Six-Turniers\u201c auch in dieser Gewichtsklasse mit den besten Boxern der Welt zu messen. \u201eDie Zeit war reif f\u00fcr neue Herausforderungen. Leider wollten im Mittelgewicht weder Felix Sturm noch Kelly Pavlik gegen mich antreten. Jetzt will ich auch in der neuen Gewichtsklasse der beste Boxer der Welt werden.\u201d\n\nDoch der Reihe nach: Seit Juli 2003 ist er bei Sauerland Event unter Vertrag. Nur wenig sp\u00e4ter, am 16. August, gab er im Boxzelt auf dem N\u00fcrburgring in einem Vier-Runden-Kampf gegen Frank Kary aus Neuwied sein erfolgreiches Profideb\u00fct. \u201eIm Februar 2003 hat sich Abraham bei mir vorgestellt und mich gebeten, ihn in das Box-Team aufzunehmen\u201d, erz\u00e4hlt Cheftrainer Ulli Wegner, \u201cich habe ihn dann als Sparringpartner von Sven Ottke verpflichtet.\u201d Abraham war zun\u00e4chst Trainingspartner des damaligen Weltmeisters, als sich dieser auf seinen WM-Kampf gegen Byron Mitchell vorbereitete. \u201cDer Junge hat sich gut angestellt und enorm im Training angestrengt\u201d, sagt Wegner, \u201cmir war bald klar, dass Abraham gut zu uns passen w\u00fcrde.\u201d Abraham, der am 20. Februar 1980 zur Welt kam, hat als Amateur 90 K\u00e4mpfe bestritten, von denen er 81 gewann. Sechsmal boxte er unentschieden und musste lediglich drei Niederlagen einstecken. Sein gr\u00f6\u00dfter Erfolg als Amateur war der Titel Internationaler Deutscher Meister im Jahr 1997. \u201cArthur ist ein sehr robuster und schlagstarker Mann\u201d, sagt Wegner, \u201cer bringt eine gute Athletik mit und hat eine angeborene Raffinesse. Ihm liegt die Boxwelt zu F\u00fc\u00dfen, doch er muss weiter hart an sich arbeiten.\u201d Der Mittelgewichtler, der gemeinsam mit seinen Eltern und seinem j\u00fcngeren Bruder Alexander 1995 nach Deutschland kam, lebt heute in Berlin.\n\nAm 10. Dezember 2005 bekam Abraham die Chance, auf die er zehn Jahre lang hingearbeitet hatte \u2013 in Leipzig k\u00e4mpfte er um den Weltmeistertitel der IBF. Gegen Kingsley Ikeke gelang ihm ein \u00fcberragender K.o.-Sieg in der f\u00fcnften Runde. Zehn spannende Titelverteidigungen \u2013 und zwei grandiose Triumphe \u00fcber Edison Miranda \u2013 verhalfen ihm zu enormer Ber\u00fchmtheit und sportlicher Anerkennung und dem Nimbus \u201eunschlagbar zu sein\u201c. In den Jahren 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 wurde er viermal hintereinander in Deutschland zum \u201eBoxer des Jahres\u201c gew\u00e4hlt.\n\nEs folgte die Einladung zum Turnier der besten Super-Mittelgewichtler der Welt. \u201cDas war eine gro\u00dfe Ehre f\u00fcr mich. Ich habe keine Sekunde gez\u00f6gert, meinen Titel sofort niedergelegt und mich auf eine neue Herausforderung gefreut.\u201d Nach dem grandiosen Auftaktsieg \u00fcber die us-amerikanische Ringlegende Jermain Taylor folgte eine umstrittene Disqualifikation gegen Andre Dirrell sowie eine Punktniederlage gegen Carl Froch. Im Halbfinale des Turniers verlor Abraham dann im Mai 2011 nach Punkten gegen den WBA-Superchamp und sp\u00e4teren Turniersieger Andre Ward. Abraham war nach diesen Niederlagen endg\u00fcltig am Tiefpunkt seiner Karriere angekommen und Stand vor der Wahl, seine Karriere zu beenden, eine R\u00fcckkehr in die alte Gewichtsklasse, das Mittelgewicht, das er einst so dominierte oder aber sich neu zu motivieren und im Super-Mittelgewicht noch einmal anzugreifen. W\u00e4hrend viele \u201eExperten\u201c das Ende der Karriere voraussahen, entschied sich Abraham f\u00fcr den den letzteren und schwersten Weg. Die Schl\u00e4ge, die ich bekam, waren nicht h\u00e4rter, aber ich konnte meine Schl\u00e4ge nicht so durchbringen wie gewohnt, und dar\u00fcber bin ich in taktische Fehler verfallen, habe zu passiv geboxt und nur auf den K.-o.-Schlag gewartet, anstatt ihn zu erzwingen\u201c, so Abraham. Gemeinsam suchten Abraham und Trainer Wegner nach neuen L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tzen. Insbesondere auf  taktischem Gebiet sollte Abraham aus den Fehlern der Vergangenheit lernen und auf die neue Gewichtsklasse vorbereitet werden. Abraham hat ein ganz klares Ziel: \u201e2012 m\u00f6chte ich wieder Weltmeister im Mittelgewicht sein!\u201c\n\nNach zwei Aufbauk\u00e4mpfen gegen Pablo Farias und Pjotr Wilczewski  im Januar und M\u00e4rz 2012, die er durch TKO bzw klar nach Punkten gewann, bot sich am 25. August 2012 die gro\u00dfe Chance: vor der gro\u00dfartigen Kulisse der Berliner 02-World durfte Abraham als Pflicht-Herausforderer von WBO-Champion Robert Stieglitz um die Weltmeisterschaft boxen. In einem au\u00dferordentlich packenden und dramatischen Duell hat Abraham den Kampf deutlich dominiert und konnte sich nach 12 Runden einstimmig durchsetzen. Damit hat er seine ganz gro\u00dfen Ziele erreicht: den Weltmeistertitel im Jahre 2012 und er hat gezeigt, dass er auch im Super-Mittelgewicht zu den Besten der Welt geh\u00f6rt.\n\nDas Box-Publikum hat es ihm gedankt und Abraham nun auch wieder im Jahr 2012 zum \u201eBoxer des Jahres\u201c gew\u00e4hlt.","birthday":"02\/20\/1980","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Berlin","state":"","country":"Germany","zip":""},"personal_interests":"Jetski fahren, schnelle Autos, Natur, Lesen","talking_about_count":4253,"username":"arthurabraham","website":"www.arthur-abraham.de","were_here_count":0,"id":"111465125584131","name":"Arthur Abraham","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/arthurabraham","likes":187544,"cover":{"cover_id":627758777288094,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1424277_627758777288094_1182544081_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":40}}

He made a second half appearance against Spain in a 2-2 draw.Further experience was gained on loan at Blackpool and when he came back to City he eventually beat off the challenge of Sweden number one Andreas Isaksson and Kasper Schmeichel to become Sven-Goran Eriksson\u2019s first choice.He won his first England cap in June 2008 against Trinidad and Tobago but having started that season as number one was replaced by Shay Given in January. Having topped 50 first team appearances, Hart spent the summer of 2009 playing for England\u2019s Under 21s in the European Championships in Sweden. The dramatic penalty shoot-out in the semi final saw Joe save a couple, and score one - but a yellow card, his second of the tournament, meant that he had to sit out the final.Around this time his season-long loan to promoted Birmingham City was also confirmed. A resounding success at St Andrews, he was named in the PFA Team of the Year and included in Fabio Capello's England squad for the World Cup. He did not play during that ill-fated campaign, but he impressed Roberto Mancini enough in pre-season to get the nod as City's first-choice goalkeeper for the start of 2010\/11.","talking_about_count":12913,"username":"25JoeHart","were_here_count":0,"id":"166198223426511","name":"Joe Hart","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/25JoeHart","likes":284176,"cover":{"cover_id":586280788084917,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1233349_586280788084917_916395538_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Welcome to the OFFICIAL Facebook page of BADR HARI.\n\nOFFICIAL Twitter account follow \u0040Team_Badr_Hari \n\nhttp:\/\/www.mikesgym.nl\/\n","affiliation":"Mike's Gym","bio":"Badr Hari is een kickbokser. Hij is geboren te Amsterdam op 8 december 1984. \nZijn ouders komen oorspronkelijk uit het plaatsje Kenitra in Marokko, ook Badr heeft veel gevoel bij de \u201croots\u201d van zijn ouders en komt daarom tijdens zijn gevechten uit onder de Marokkaanse vlag.\n\nAls kind begon Badr te trainen bij Sitan Gym. Na een paar jaar ging hij over naar Pancration Chakuriki, de sportschool van Thom Harinck. Tegenwoordig traint Badr onder leiding van Mike Passenier in de Gym van Passenier, Mike's Gym in Oostzaan. In januari 2005 tekende Hari een contract bij promotor Simon Rutz en werd hij opgenomen in het It's Showtime team. Op 28 april 2007 werd Badr de eerste K-1 Heavyweight Wereldkampioen tijdens het titelgevecht op Hawa\u00ef. In de eerste ronde trapte hij Yusuku Fujimoto knock-out met een high kick op zijn kaak, dit betekende de absolute doorbraak van een jong, bijzonder fenomeen en sportman!\n\nBadr vecht voornamelijk op K-1 regels en stond ondanks zijn jonge leeftijd al twee keer in de finale van de K-1 te Japan. K-1 is een Japanse organisatie, gesticht door Mr. Ishii, die een competitie-vorm heeft bedacht waarbij alle staande vechtsporten, zoals Kung Fu, Karate & Kempo zich met elkaar kunnen meten. Het lijkt nog het meest op kickboksen, maar je mag bij K-1 ook de knie\u00ebn gebruiken. Voor de finale worden er overal ter wereld kwalificatiewedstrijden gevochten, mede hierdoor is K-1 veruit de grootste en meest populaire kickboksorganisatie ter wereld, en heeft zeer hoge prijzengelden. De wedstrijden worden in meer dan 135 landen uitgezonden en door deze zeer brede aandacht is Badr Hari, mede door zijn stijl, doorzettingsvermogen en uitstraling de meest populaire K-1 vechter ter wereld geworden.\n\nBadr Hari: Ik train twee keer per dag, zes keer per week. En op de zevende dag doe ik looptrainingen, dat is dus dertien trainingen per week!! Ik zie profs in andere sporten dat nog niet zo snel doen. Of het ook loont? Ik denk dat je in Nederland op \u00e9\u00e9n hand kan tellen hoeveel kickboxers van de sport kunnen leven. Maar zit je eenmaal in Japan bij de top, dan behoor je in Nederland tot de grootverdieners. In Japan lopen ze wat dat betreft op ons voor. Maar hier komt dat nog wel, let maar op! Het is al zo dat vechtsporten steeds populairder worden en al tientallenjaren domineren de Nederlandse en de in Nederland opgeleide vechtsporters de vechtsportscene. adr: Ik train voor een partij twee\u00ebnhalve maand kei- en keihard, dan zit ik constant met gezonde spanning en een beetje stress\u2026. Op het moment dat ik opkom en in de schijnwerpers sta, dan is zo\u00b4n show opvoeren voor mij een hele ontlading. Aan de andere kant wordt ik ook gezien als een product, dat aan het publiek moet worden verkocht. Ik zeg het niet graag over mezelf, maar volgens kenners heb ik die extra finesse dat mensen mijn naam onthouden. Dat iedereen weet die Badr, die heeft een opkomst en geeft zich 500\u0025, niet normaal meer. Daar komen de mensen voor!

I grew up in Kandy, Sri Lanka\u2019s hill-country capital. My tertiary education was cut short by my cricket career. Keen to follow in my father\u2019s footsteps, I enrolled at the University of Colombo to complete a Bachelor of Law. But my selection for the Sri Lanka A tour to South Africa in 1998 was the start of a hectic tour schedule that left less and less time for personal study. I still hope to complete the degree one day, probably after cricket now. As a boy, I was a vociferous reader, a hobby I still love, especially on tour. I explored a wide range of subjects and hobbies at school.  My friends still make fun of me being a young chorister and also trying to play the violin.  As a student, I particularly enjoyed English literature and was fascinated by Greek and Roman Civilisations. In addition to cricket, I always loved tennis and, at one stage, I even thought about taking it up professionally. Thankfully, though, I choose cricket because I was certainly no Federer. I also liked badminton and table tennis. Nowadays I am learning golf \u2013 although frustratingly Mahela is still much better. I\u2019ll catch-up with him soon.\n\nI was the youngest child in a family of four. My father, Kshema, is a lawyer (as well as being my most vocal critic and batting coach). I have two elder sisters, Thushari and Saranga, and an elder brother, Vemendra. In May 2003 I married my childhood sweetheart, Yehali, with whom I fell in love with aged just 17.\n","personal_interests":"Star sign? Leo  \n\nWhere were you born? Matale  \n\nFavourite food?

His father bought him his first motocross bike when he was only four years old in hopes of spending some quality time with his son. However, what had originally started as a father and son pastime quickly turned into Carey\u2019s passion. By the time he entered his first local race as an amateur, he was hooked and by high school graduation, Carey Hart was a professional motocross rider, racing the AMA Supercross circuit.\n\nSoon thereafter, Carey grew bored with Supercross and started riding with a group of guys who were interested in a more creative and expressive form of motocross. In 1998, the freestyle motocross movement was born with Carey leading the way. From the sport\u2019s inception, Carey has been one of the most innovative riders in the sport. He is the inventor of the Hart Attack, and at the 2000 Gravity Games Carey etched his name in the record books as the first rider ever to complete a back flip on a 250cc motorcycle. The back flip catapulted Carey, and Freestyle Motocross as a whole, to an entirely new level. The stunt got the world\u2019s attention; it was even featured on Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not!\n\nCarey has traveled the globe on a quest to put freestyle motocross on the map.  His popularity has helped increase exposure for the sport of Freestyle Motocross. He has been featured in nationwide ad campaigns for Ford and Mountain Dew as well as in such print publications such as Paper Magazine, Teen People, EXPN The Magazine, Rolling Stone, and has graced the covers of numerous motocross magazines. Carey has also starred on The Late Show with David Letterman, appeared on The Today Show and has starred in ESPN\/Touchstone Pictures\u2019 IMAX film, Ultimate X and has cameo appearances in Columbia Pictures\u2019 XXX and Touchstone Pictures\u2019 Charlie\u2019s Angels II and in the VH1 reality show The Surreal Life.\n\nIn 2004 Carey\u2019s passion for tattoos turned into a business venture. Hart & Huntington Tattoo Company opened its doors in the prestigious Palms Casino, Las Vegas. This move lead to another TV opportunity for Carey when the A&E network decided to follow him and the workings of the shop in their own reality show: INKED.  Since then, three more Hart and Huntington Tattoo shops have opened: Honolulu, Niagara Falls, and Orlando at Universal CityWalk. In 2009 the H&H shop relocated to The Hard Rock Hotel. Carey also expanded the brand, making a quality clothing line based on the designs of the talented artists that work at Hart and Huntington Tattoo Company. The line can be found at all of the tattoo shops, online, as well as at some major retailers.\n\nIn addition to these business ventures, he still dedicates significant time to one of his biggest passions, his Supercross team. Carey funds one of the most popular and lifestyle-driven privateer teams to hit Supercross. In 2011, Carey welcomed a new title sponsor Dodge Motorsports who entered the Supercross space for the first time. Carey has taken his team to a whole new level for the 2012 Supercross season by doubling its size of talented riders at a time when most teams are down scaling.\n\nEarning the first annual R.A.D. Lifetime achievement award for his impact on freestyle motocross, this Las Vegas native is determined to ride until he stops having fun and hopefully for us, that\u2019s not anytime soon.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":28209,"username":"CareyHart46","website":"www.hartandhuntington.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"135934596440350","name":"Carey Hart","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CareyHart46","likes":264634,"cover":{"cover_id":607772222589916,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1148874_607772222589916_1663438925_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"I Love Lampard. \u003C3        Please Support for Lampard ..!","affiliation":"||baR10||","bio":"Frank James Lampard (born 20 June 1978) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Chelsea and the England national team. He also holds the position of vice-captain for his club side.[3] He is considered to be one of the best English footballers.[4][5][6][7]\nLampard began his career at West Ham United, his father's former club. He had secured a place in the first team by the 1997\u201398 season, and the following year helped the team finish 5th in the Premier League, their highest ever Premier League placing. In 2001, he moved to rival London club Chelsea for \u00a311 million.\nFrom his debut onwards he was ever-present in the Chelsea first team, setting a record 164 consecutive Premier League appearances. He established himself as a prolific scorer at the West London club and was a key part of the sides which won back-to-back Premier League titles in 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 and a domestic cup double in 2007.

{"category":"Interest","description":"Wayne Douglas Gretzky, CC is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and former head coach. He played 20 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for four teams from 1979 to 1999. Nicknamed \"The Great One\", he has been called \"the greatest hockey player ever\" by many sportswriters, players, and the NHL itself. He is the leading point-scorer in NHL history, with more assists than any other player has points, and is the only NHL player to total over 200\u00a0points in one season \u2013 a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, he tallied over 100\u00a0points in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive. At the time of his retirement in 1999, he held 40 regular-season records, 15 playoff records, and six All-Star records. He won the Lady Byng Trophy for sportsmanship and performance five times, and he often spoke out against fighting in hockey.Born and raised in Brantford, Ontario, Gretzky honed his skills at a backyard rink and regularly played minor hockey at a level far above his peers. Despite his unimpressive stature, strength and speed, Gretzky's intelligence and reading of the game were unrivaled. He was adept at dodging checks from opposing players, and he could consistently anticipate where the puck was going to be and execute the right move at the right time. Gretzky also became known for setting up behind his opponent's net, an area that was nicknamed \"Gretzky's office\".In 1978, he signed with the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association (WHA), where he briefly played before being traded to the Edmonton Oilers. When the WHA folded, the Oilers joined the NHL, where he established many scoring records and led his team to four Stanley Cup championships. His trade to the Los Angeles Kings on August 9, 1988, had an immediate impact on the team's performance, eventually leading them to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, and he is credited with popularizing hockey in California. Gretzky played briefly for the St. Louis Blues before finishing his career with the New York Rangers. Gretzky captured nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player, ten Art Ross Trophies for most points in a season, five Lady Byng Trophies, five Lester B. Pearson Awards, and two Conn Smythe Trophies as playoff MVP.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":18,"website":"http:\/\/books.google.ca\/books?id=jO-fA17p-cQC&lpg=PP1&dq=Wayne\u002520Gretzky&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true","were_here_count":0,"id":"105590659475179","name":"Wayne Gretzky","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Wayne-Gretzky\/105590659475179","likes":147489}

{"affiliation":"LA Dodgers","birthday":"05\/30\/1972","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Santo Domingo","state":"","country":"Dominican Republic","zip":""},"personal_info":"Name: Manuel Aristidez Ramirez\nHeight: 6\"0\nWeight: 200 lbs\n\nBorn to Aristides and Onelcida Ramirez, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Manuel Aristides (Manny) Ramirez traveled a long road to become one of the best hitters in Major League Baseball.\n\nDuring the 70s, football, hockey and soccer were hardly known in the Dominican Republic, and there weren't many basketball courts. Consequently, like most children who attended school in the afternoon, Manny grew up playing baseball every morning and evening with friends. \"I don't remember much about those times, but I do remember that my mom would get upset, because I never came home in time to eat at the table with the rest of the family. I was always at the field playing\" (Manny). Baseball had taken a hold of Manny. Thus, in addition to playing he would watch the Winter League games to focus on what exceptional players did to win. Pedro Guerrero, Tony Fernandez, Julio Franco, Tony Pe\u00f1a, Alfredo Griffin, Juan Samuel and George Bell were among his idols. During these years, Manny also learned about the Dodgers, the Blue Jays, the Phillies, the Pirates and of course, the Yankees. Manny was changing. He was growing, but his understanding and his love for this game was growing too. For him, baseball was more than a game to have fun. It became a serious affair. Nevertheless, from the age of 5 to 12, his routine didn't change much - to the field in the morning, to school in the afternoon and back to the field in the evening.Then, at 13 years old his life headed in a new direction.\n\nManny's high school experience was bitter sweet. Yet he made the best of it. He sat with his high school coach for hours to talk about what he needed to do to become an outstanding baseball player. Then he would turn the advice into practice. Manny would wake up at the crack of dawn to run before going to school, and after dinner he went to a friend's house to lift weights. He was a very hard worker. He never missed or arrived late to practice. He was the star of the high school team. He was determined to become a better player, and when coaches, spectators and friends asserted that he could make it to the Big Leagues, Manny's determination became even stronger. And the fruits of his hard work began to show.\n\nManny led George Washington High School to three straight Manhattan Division championships (1988-1990) and to the Division finals in 1991. In his junior year, Manny belted a home run measured at over 400 feet in a game played in Central Park vs. Park West High School. As a senior vs. Brandeis High School, he walloped two home runs, each traveling over 430 feet. Manny's final high school numbers were exceptional: batting average of .630, slugging percentage of 1.455, and a home run every 5.7 at bats. He received All-City honors in 1989, '90 and '91 and was named New York City Public Schools \"High School Player of the Year\"\n\nDuring his high school years, Manny also played summer ball in the Youth Service League. He traveled all over the United States with the Youth Service teams, including two trips in 1989 and 1990 to the AABC Connie Mack World Series in Farmington, New Mexico. He also played Pony League, American Legion and Connie Mack ball; he excelled in all.\n\nFinally, in June 1991, he received the good news and his family cheered. The Cleveland Indians selected Manny in the first round (13th overall) of the Major League Baseball amateur draft; the same draft that produced Cliff Floyd, Shawn Green, and Pokey Reese. Former Indians scouting director Mickey White, one of the decision-makers who chose to draft Ramirez, saw in Manny a player who loved baseball. Manny was signed by scout Joe Delucca, and then sent to Burlington to begin his minor league professional career in the summer of 1991.\n\nIn the minors, Manny continued to work very hard, and accumulated impressive numbers. He led the Appalachian League in total bases (146), home runs (19), RBI (63), and slugging percentage (.679). Managers voted him the league's MVP and top prospect. In 1992, Manny was promoted to Single-A Kinston and was named the most exciting player in the Carolina League, even though a hand injury limited him to just 81 games. One of the youngest players in the league at 19 years old, he batted .278 with 18 doubles, 13 home runs, and 63 RBI. A year later, Manny was promoted to AA Canton-Akron, where he led the Eastern League with his .340 batting average. Manny then made a quick stop in AAA Charlotte. He played only 40 games there but made enough of an impression on manager Charlie Manuel that he predicted greatness for the young slugger; and great he became.\n\nOn September 2, 1993, Manny made his major league debut, going 0 for 4 in Minnesota. However, the next night, in his second major league game, Manny exploded with three extra-base hits (two homers and a ground-rule double) in front of his family and friends against his hometown Yankees. His first big league hit was a double off Melido Perez and his first homer was also off Perez. He played only 22 games in 93. \n\n1994 was Manny's first year in the majors, and it was sweet. He hit .269 with 17 homers and 60 RBI, in the strike-shortened season. Manny ultimately ended up finishing second to Bob Hamelin in the Rookie of the Year voting. In 1995, Manny hit .308 with 31 home runs and 107 RBI; his career had taken off. Over the next few years, Manny continued to hit. He hit with power. He hit line drives. He hit consistently. He hit to the opposite field. He hit when he was behind in the count. He hit fastballs and breaking balls and knuckleballs. His hitting became so intimidating that pitchers frequently walked him intentionally with first base occupied. Year after year, he put up great numbers and developed the reputation as an RBI machine. Manny was the heart and soul of the fearsome Cleveland offense of the late 1990's, an offense that propelled the Indians into the post-season every year from 1995 to 1999, which marked his last year with Cleveland.\n\nOn December 12, 2000, Manny signed a $160 million, eight-year contract to play with the Boston Red Sox. His signing came just hours after Texas signed shortstop Alex Rodriguez to a record-shattering 10-year, $252 million deal. \"My decision to play in Boston was not only about money. I wanted to play for a team that had a better chance to win the World Series, a team that could really battle the Yankees. I knew Boston was serious about winning. That's why I signed with the Red Sox.\"\n\nThe 2001 season opened in Boston, and the Fenway Faithful came to see what Manny would bring. Manny delivered. On the first pitch he saw wearing a Red Sox uniform in Fenway Park, he homered over the Green Monster. It was the beginning of another great year for Manny. However, three years later, the World Series title continues to elude Boston and Manny. Will this be the year? \n\n2004 marks Manny's fourth season with the Boston Red Sox, a team with which he feels a special connection. \"I will do my best for our team to win, the management wants our team to win and our fans will never forget the day we win it all. This point brings everyone together. This is where the gossip stops,\" and the ending of the 2004 season proved Manny right.\n\nThe Boston Red Sox became the 2004 World Champions, and the city of Boston hosted the ultimate party, as the Red Sox Nation finally celebrated. Sox management had fulfilled its deepest desire, by bringing the World Championship to Boston after an 86 year drought. And Manny 's performance earned him the World Series Most Valuable Player trophy.\n\n\"I just feel so proud of being part of the team that brought the Championship to these fans.\" \"I'm just blessed to be the MVP and to win a World Series. I think God is blessing me with a lot of stuff -- my two kids, my wife, everything. I have it all. There's nothing that I can complain about.\"","talking_about_count":59,"website":"http:\/\/www.mannyramirez.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"15245475481","name":"Manny Ramirez","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Manny-Ramirez\/15245475481","likes":156503}

{"about":"This is NOT Dennis Bergkamp nor an official page.\nJust from a little Arsenal and Dennis fan.","birthday":"05\/10\/1969","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"AFC Ajax\nBergkamp was brought up through Ajax's famous youth system, joining the club at age 12. He was given his professional debut by coach Johan Cruijff on December 14, 1986 against Roda JC, and went on to make 14 appearances that season. He played as a substitute in the 1987 European Cup Winners Cup final against Lokomotive Leipzig, which Ajax won.\n\nThe following season, Bergkamp became a regular for Ajax, winning the Dutch league in 1990, the UEFA Cup in 1992 and the KNVB Cup in 1993. From 1991 to 1993 Bergkamp was top scorer in the Eredivisie, and he was voted Player of the Year in 1992 and 1993. In all, Bergkamp scored 122 goals in 239 games for his hometown club.\n\n\nInternazionale\nIn the summer of 1993, Bergkamp and his Ajax team-mate Wim Jonk were signed by Internazionale of Milan. However, his time in Italy was less successful. Although he won a second UEFA Cup in 1994, he found it hard to adapt to the Italian defensive style of play, scoring just 11 times in 50 appearances. Bergkamp's poor form was not helped by his frosty relationship with the Italian press, and indeed some of his teammates.\n\n\nArsenal\n \nBergkamp at ArsenalAfter two unhappy seasons at Inter, Bergkamp was signed by Arsenal boss Bruce Rioch in June 1995 for \u00a37.5m. Bergkamp made his debut against Middlesbrough on 19 August 1995 but had to adapt to the English style of play; it took him seven games before he managed to score his first goal, against Southampton. Slowly but surely, Bergkamp's stature grew, playing as a forward behind the main striker, Ian Wright. They soon formed a strong partnership which was one of the finest in the Premier League. Bergkamp has been regarded by many football pundits such as Alan Hansen as being the greatest foreign player to grace the English game.\n\nBergkamp's arrival at Arsenal was significant, not only as he was one of the first world-class foreign players to join an English club since the lifting of the Heysel ban in 1990, but also because he was a major contributor to the club's return to success after a brief period of mediocrity of the mid-1990s.\n\nBergkamp hit his best form for Arsenal after the arrival of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger in September 1996. Arsenal won a Premiership and FA Cup double in the 1997-98 season (although Bergkamp missed the cup final with an injury), and Bergkamp was voted PFA Player of the Year. In September 1997, he became the first and so far only player to have come first, second and third in Match of the Day's Goal of the Month competition, for a hat trick against Leicester City. He scored 16 times that season, as well as being involved in setting up many more. At the end of that same season, he helped the Netherlands to a fourth-place finish at the 1998 World Cup. In that competition he scored one of the greatest goals of all time in a quarter final win against Argentina, after receiving a 60 yard pass from Frank de Boer.\n\nWhile his form since has not matched the spectacle of that season, Bergkamp continued to be a regular in the Arsenal team. He won the double again in 2002, the FA Cup in 2003 and the Premiership for a third time in 2004. The club's domestic success has not been matched in European competition, the closest to winners' medals coming when they lost the 2000 UEFA Cup final to Galatasaray on penalties and the 2006 Champions League final loss to Barcelona; Bergkamp travelled overland to Paris for his competitive farewell, only to be an unused substitute.\n\nIn 2005, due to Arsenal's reluctance in offering him a new deal, there was speculation that Bergkamp would leave the club, and possibly football altogether. Bergkamp had said he would retire from football if not offered a new contract with Arsenal for the 2005-06 campaign, despite interest from his former club Ajax. Following Arsenal's penalty shootout victory over Manchester United in the FA Cup Final in Cardiff though, it was revealed he would sign a one-year contract extension, which was custom by the manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger for players over 30 years old, keeping him at the London club for their final season at the Arsenal Stadium at Highbury.\n\nOn April 15, 2006, the home match against West Bromwich Albion, the Arsenal supporters dedicated the original \"Supporter's Day\" match theme (one of the designated theme days Arsenal prepared to celebrate their last year at Highbury before moving to the Emirates Stadium) to \"Dennis Bergkamp Day\", to commemorate Bergkamp's time at Arsenal. Bergkamp came on as a second half substitute, setting up the winning Robert Pir\u00e8s goal, after Albion had equalised just after he came on. He scored a curler himself at the 89th minute, as Arsenal ran out 3-1 winners. That goal proved to be the last goal Bergkamp scored in Arsenal colours and in competitive football.\n\nBergkamp officially retired from competitive football after the 2006 Champions League final game against FC Barcelona on May 17, 2006. The last game he played in Arsenal colours was also the last game at Highbury, against Wigan Athletic on May 7, 2006 - the final Premier League game of that season. Bergkamp scored 120 goals for Arsenal in 424 appearances, and set up a further 166 goals in his Arsenal career. This makes him one of the top three assist makers in Premier League history.\n\n\nInternational career\n\nBergkamp made his international d\u00e9but for the Netherlands against Italy on September 26, 1990. His first major tournament was Euro 92, where the Dutch were defending champions. Bergkamp impressed, but the Dutch lost on penalties in the semi-finals to the team that would go on to win the tournament, Denmark, despite Bergkamp scoring both in regular time and in the penalty shoot-out.\n\nBergkamp also impressed in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, playing in all of his side's matches, scoring a spectacular goal against Brazil, a match the Dutch ultimately lost 3-2. The Netherlands disappointed in Euro 96, with the squad riven by in-fighting, although Bergkamp still scored once, and set up Patrick Kluivert's consolatory goal against England that got the side into the quarter-finals.\n\nIn the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Bergkamp scored three times, the most memorable of which being the winning goal in the final minute of the quarter-final against Argentina. Bergkamp took a leaping first touch to instantly control a long 60-yard aerial pass from Frank de Boer, brought the ball down through Argentine defender Roberto Ayala's legs (nutmeg), and finally finished by firing a volley with the outside of his right foot past the keeper at a tight angle from the right. With three intelligent right-footed touches in a matter of seconds, he was able to turn the game and send his national squad into the semifinal round.\n\nThe Netherlands joint-hosted Euro 2000 and were one of the favourites. After progressing through the \"group of death\", they lost on penalties to Italy in the semi-finals. Bergkamp didn't score at all during the tournament but still played an important role. After the defeat, Bergkamp announced his retirement from international football, because the next major tournament, the 2002 FIFA World Cup, would be played in Japan and South Korea and Bergkamp's aviophobia (see below) would prevent him from travelling there. He did not play the qualification matches, since he thought that it would be unfair to do so.\n\nHe ended his international career first on the all-time list of goal scorers for the Dutch national team, with 37 goals in 79 games, although his record has since been passed by Patrick Kluivert.\n\n\nTestimonial match\n\nBergkamp had the honour of being the focus of the first match at Arsenal's new ground, the Emirates Stadium. On 22 July 2006, a testimonial was played in his honour at the new stadium, with Arsenal playing his old club Ajax. Bergkamp kicked off the match with his father, Wim, and son, Mitchel. All four children act as the match's mascots. The first half was played by members of Arsenal and Ajax's current squads, while the second was played by famous ex-players from both sides; for example Ian Wright, Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit and David Seaman for Arsenal, and Marco van Basten, Danny Blind, Johan Cruijff, Frank and Ronald de Boer for Ajax. Arsenal won the match 2-1 with goals from Thierry Henry and Nwankwo Kanu; Klaas-Jan Huntelaar had earlier opened the scoring for Ajax, making him the first goalscorer at the Emirates Stadium.\n\nBergkamp idolized Glenn Hoddle since childhood, but has denied many times of being a Spurs fan. \"Maybe I was...maybe I am, a little different from other players. They will tell you that Pel\u00e9, Maradona, Cruyff are their idols and I will say Glenn Hoddle. Main thing was that I was a big fan of Glenn Hoddle. When you wanted to see Hoddle play you watched Tottenham. People often assume I'm a Spurs fan but it's not true. I was a fan of Glenn Hoddle, not of Spurs,\" Bergkamp once said.\n\n\nOthers on Bergkamp\n\nWikiquote has a collection of quotations related to: \nDennis BergkampIn Brilliant Orange (ISBN 0-7475-5310-6), David Winner's analysis of the way in which Dutch football and Dutch culture blend, the sculptor Jeroen Henneman analyzes the effect of Dennis Bergkamp's passes and how he can split a defence: \"It's a miracle. One moment the pitch is crowded and narrow. Suddenly it is huge and wide.\"\n\nBergkamp's close control and skill in passing the ball has put him in very high regard by Arsenal's fans, who have given him the nickname \"God\". Other nicknames given to him by fans included \"Dennis the Menace\", \"the Dutch Master\", \"the non-Flying Dutchman\", \"Iceman\" and \"Bergy\".\n\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger also said about him after Arsenal's 3-1 win over West Bromwich Albion (April 16, 2006) that Bergkamp had:\n\n\"Intelligence and class. Class is of course, most of the time linked to what you can do with the ball, but the intelligence makes you use the technique in an efficient way. It's like somebody who has a big vocabulary but he doesn't say intelligent words, and somebody who has a big vocabulary but he can talk intelligently, and that's what Dennis is all about. What he does, there's always a head and always a brain. And his technique allows him to do what he sees, and what he decides to do.\"\nBergkamp's former strike partner Thierry Henry praised the Dutchman after his last game for the club:\n\n\"Dennis is the best player I have ever played with as a partner. It is a dream for a striker to have him in the team with you.\" \nArsenal Legend Ian Wright said of Bergkamp:\n\n\"He's the messiah. We told him to get us into Europe when he joined and that's exactly what he did.\"\nIn April 2006, Simon Kuper wrote in the Financial Times:\n\n\"One night last year some legends of Dutch football gathered for dinner in an Amsterdam house. Around midnight conversation turned to an old question: who was the best Dutch footballer ever? Dutchmen have been voted European Footballer of the Year seven times, more than any other nationality except Germans. Yet Jan Mulder, a great centre-forward turned writer, chose a player who had never even threatened to win the award nor, at the time, a Champions League: 'Bergkamp. He had the finest technique', said Mulder. Guus Hiddink, the great Dutch manager, nodded, and so the matter was settled.\"\n\n\nAviophobia\n\nDennis Bergkamp is well known for having a disabling fear of flying, which developed after the Dutch squad were involved in an incident concerning their aircraft during the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States.[8] The Dutch squad travelled together with a group of journalists, one of whom made remarks about the long waiting time, wondering if there was a bomb on the plane. This provoked a panic amongst passengers and in particular Bergkamp. This incident reminded Bergkamp of a plane crash which killed many Surinamese-Dutch players when they flew to Suriname. Ever since, Bergkamp has had a dislike of flying. This gave rise to the nickname the non-Flying Dutchman, a variation on The Flying Dutchman. He was thus often unable to play for Arsenal outside of England. He would, if required, take a train or drive there himself.

He is usually deployed as a deep-lying playmaker for both","bio":"Pirlo was born in Flero, Lombardy, Italy. His brother Ivan plays for a Serie C2 club in Brescia. Pirlo made his debut for Brescia against Reggina. After breaking into the Brescia first team, Pirlo was spotted by Internazionale coach Mircea Lucescu, who signed the playmaker. Pirlo was unable to break into the first squad, however, and Internazionale finished eighth in the 1998\u201399 Serie A campaign. Pirlo was shipped off on loan to the club he made his debut against in 1995, Reggina. After an impressive season, he returned to Internazionale but was once again unable to break into the first squad, making just four league appearances and spent the second half of the season on loan at former club, Brescia.\n\n\nAndrea Pirlo warming up with Milan against Fiorentina\nAfter three seasons on the Internazionale books, Pirlo was sold to fierce rivals Milan for 35 billion Italian lire[7] (about \u20ac18 million). That transfer windows the two clubs has also swapped Cristian Brocchi for Guly; Paolo Ginestra for Matteo Bogani. The deals later reported by press were also aimed to create \"false profit\" by inflating the transfer fees in the swap deal, which Ginestra and Bogani both created \u20ac3.5 million \"profit\" for both clubs but in terms of registration rights.[8][9]\nIt was at Milan where he found his true strides developing into a world class player. With Milan, he won two Scudetto and two Champions League titles. He also won an Italian Cup and two UEFA Super Cups with Milan in 2003 and 2007. His most forgettable incident, however, was the penalty miss during 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, as his spot kick was saved by Jerzy Dudek.\nPirlo started his career as an offensive midfielder until coach Carlo Mazzone developed a deep-seated playmaking role while at Brescia with Roberto Baggio. Carlo Ancelotti further-developed this role at Milan. Since then, he has formed a formidable partnership with Gennaro Gattuso in the midfield and has earned the nickname the metronome for the way he sets the team's rhythm.[10] He led Serie A in the 2002\u201303 season in four special categories \u2014 passes played (2589), ball possession (123 hours played and 39 minutes), successful balls (661), and successful passes (2093). This implies that he averaged almost 90 passes per game. He led Milan in minutes played for the 2006\u201307 season with 2,782. In October 2007, he was nominated for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year Award but it went to Milan teammate Kak\u00e1 instead. After Kak\u00e1 and coach Carlo Ancelotti left Milan in the summer of 2009, Chelsea tested Milan's resolve by bidding $12 million and Claudio Pizarro for Pirlo. The club rejected the offer and Pirlo was said to be contemplating a transfer request.[citation needed] On 5 August, club owner Silvio Berlusconi decided not to sell Pirlo, who said he was overjoyed and wanted to end his career at Milan.[11] On 21 October 2009, Pirlo scored a notable 30 meter goal in Milan's 3\u20132 win over Real Madrid.\nOn 2 October 2010, Pirlo scored a 40-yard goal against Parma to give Milan their first away win of the 2010\u201311 season. On 18 May 2011, Pirlo confirmed that he would be leaving Milan at the end of the 2010\u201311 season, after a mutual decision not to renew his contract.[12]","category":"Athlete","description":"Andrea Pirlo, Ufficiale OMRI[1][2] (born 19 May 1979 in Flero, Lombardy), is an Italian World Cup-winning footballer who currently plays for Serie A club Juventus and for the Italian national team.

The Columbus, Ind., native has earned 11 driving titles since he first wheeled a go-kart at a Westport, Ind., racetrack in 1978. Stewart\u2019s championship tally is as follows\u2026\n\nThree NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championships \nOne IROC Series championship\nOne IndyCar Series championship \nFour United States Auto Club (USAC) championships\nThree karting championships  \n\nIn 2009, Stewart took his racing acumen to the boardroom by becoming a driver\/owner in the elite NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. After 10 years of racing for someone else in the Sprint Cup Series, Stewart is his own boss at Stewart-Haas Racing, where he drives the No. 14 Office Depot\/Mobil 1 Chevrolet Impala.\n\nIn his first season as a driver\/owner, Stewart won the non-points NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race at Charlotte (N.C.) Motor Speedway and then rattled off four point-paying victories, becoming the first driver\/owner to win a Sprint Cup race since Ricky Rudd on Sept. 27, 1998 at Martinsville (Va.) Speedway. Along the way, Stewart climbed atop the championship point standings, leading the way for 13 straight weeks before the points were reset for the final, 10-race Chase for the Championship.\n\nAnd in 2010, Stewart again made the Chase. It was another strong season for the now 13-year veteran, as Stewart won two races and two poles. He has won at least one race in each of his 12 previous years in Sprint Cup, the longest such streak among active drivers.\n\nStewart enters the 2011 Sprint Cup season having scored 39 victories, 12 poles, 153 top-fives 247 top-10s while leading over 11,100 laps in 428 career starts.\n\nIn his Sprint Cup career, Stewart has earned such accolades as:\n\nThe 1999 Rookie of the Year title, where Stewart became the first driver in Sprint Cup history to win three races as a rookie.\n\nThe winningest Sprint Cup driver in 2000 with six victories, breaking the previous record for most wins by a second-year driver.\n\nThe only driver to complete the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day, a feat Stewart has accomplished twice \u2013 first in 1999 when he finished ninth and fourth, respectively, and again in 2001, when he finished sixth and third, respectively.  \n\nBut long before Stewart became a NASCAR superstar, his star shown brightly en route to his NASCAR success.\n\nPrior to joining the NASCAR ranks, Stewart captured the 1997 IndyCar Series championship. And before that, he was the 1995 USAC Triple Crown champion, laying claim to the National Midget, Sprint and Silver Crown titles \u2013 the top three tiers of USAC\u2019s racing ladder. Overshadowed by that impressive season was Stewart\u2019s first USAC title \u2013 the 1994 National Midget crown.\n\nRacing and winning came early to Stewart. He first began wheeling a go-kart at age seven, and by the time he was eight, Stewart had won his first championship \u2013 a 4-cycle rookie junior class championship at the Columbus, Ind., fairgrounds. Two more karting championships followed, but on a national level with the 1983 International Karting Federation Grand National championship and the 1987 World Karting Association National championship.  He moved to Three-Quarter Midgets in 1989 before turning his attention toward USAC, where Stewart\u2019s path to NASCAR began.\n","personal_interests":"Hobbies: Fishing, Hunting, Pool, Bowling, Golf, Scuba Diving and Video Gaming\n\nFavorite Pastime: Racing USAC Midget, Sprint and Silver Crown cars\n","talking_about_count":33559,"username":"TonyStewart","website":"www.tonystewart.com www.tonystewartfoundation.org www.tonystewartracing.com www.stewarthaasracing.com www.facebook.com\/stewarthaasracing","were_here_count":0,"id":"111065427436","name":"Tony Stewart","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TonyStewart","likes":625865,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151869961732437","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1234917_10151869961732437_1733719770_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

He currently plays for Chelsea in the Premier League, where he is deputy vice-captain, and is the captain and all-time top scorer of the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire national football team. He has scored more goals for Chelsea than any other foreign player and is currently Chelsea's sixth highest goal scorer of all time. His key attributes include his physical strength, ability in the air, and his power to retain possession of the ball.\nAfter playing in youth teams, Drogba made his professional debut aged 18 for Ligue 2 club Le Mans. A late bloomer, he signed his first professional contract aged 21; it was not until the 2002\u201303 season that he realized his potential, scoring 17 goals in 34 appearances in Ligue 1 for Guingamp. During the same season he made his first international appearance for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, in September, and scored his first international goal the following February. He moved to Olympique de Marseille in 2003 for \u00a33.3 million. His scoring success at Olympique de Marseille continued, finishing as the third highest scorer in Ligue 1 with 19 goals and helped the club to reach the 2004 UEFA Cup Final.\nDrogba moved to Chelsea the following season for a record breaking fee of \u00a324 million, making him the most expensive Ivoirian player in history. In addition, he scored decisive goals in the 2005 Football League Cup Final and in the 2005 FA Community Shield and helped the club win their first ever Premier League title. Drogba came to prominence as one of the world's foremost strikers in 2006 as he won the league title with Chelsea again and captained the national team for the first time. In the 2006 World Cup he scored C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's first ever goal of the competition and he was chosen as the 2006 African Footballer of the Year. The next season he finished as top scorer in the 2006\u201307 Premier League with 20 goals and also scored the winning goals in the 2007 Football League Cup Final and FA Cup Finals. He won the FA Cup for the second time in 2009, scoring the equalizer in the final. In the 2009\u201310 season Drogba proved instrumental in Chelsea winning their first double in the club's history. He won his second Golden Boot with 29 goals, and scored the only goal in Chelsea's victory over Portsmouth in the 2010 FA Cup Final. This goal makes him the only player to score in six English Cup finals.\nDrogba is credited with playing a vital role in bringing peace to his country. After C\u00f4te d'Ivoire qualified for the 2006 World Cup, Drogba made a desperate plea to the combatants, asking them to lay down their arms, a plea which was answered with a cease fire after five years of civil war. Drogba later helped move an African Cup of Nations qualifier to the rebel stronghold of Bouake; a move that helped confirm the peace process. His involvement in the peace process lead to Drogba being named as one of the world's 100 most influential people by Time magazine.","birthday":"03\/11\/1978","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_interests":"League\t3 titles.

The WBA interim super flyweight world champion, he won the title in August, 2009, and has made one successful defense.\n\nHe is also a former IBF flyweight world champion - he won the title in July, 2007, and made three successful title defenses. He vacated the title to move up in weight.\n\nNonito has an exceptional combination of skill, power, and speed, and is considered by most observers to be one of the top fighters at any weight in the ring today - one of the  best \"Pound for Pound.\"\n\nHe is coming off a third-round knockout win against former WBO interim mini-flyweight world champion Manuel Vargas in his last fight in February, 2010.\n\nAfter the fight, Dan Rafael wrote on ESPN.com [excerpts]: With his country's hero Manny Pacquiao at ringside, Donaire...took care of business in devastating fashion. Donaire, one of the top pound-for-pound fighters in boxing, expected to defend his interim 115-pound belt against Mexico's Gerson Guerrero. However, Guerrero fell out of the fight...when he failed a prefight eye exam. Vargas, also of Mexico, was brought in on short notice....\n\nVargas was game, though. He did his best but simply could not handle Donaire's size and strength. It was just a matter of time until Donaire put him out of his misery, which came in the third round. That's when Donaire drilled him with a huge left uppercut midway through the round. Vargas went down on a delayed reaction and could not beat the count....\n\nIt was an explosive and exciting performance from Donaire.... [End Rafael item]\n\nNonito won the IBF flyweight world title in July, 2007, with a spectacular, devastating one-punch knockout against previously undefeated defending champion Vic Darchinyan. The knockout was so devastating that during his post-fight interview, Darchinyan didn't seem to realize he had just been knocked out.\n\nBoxing News reported [excerpts]: Darchinyan...was caught with a left hook that was reminiscent of the perfect punch Sugar Ray Robinson used to knock out Gene Fullmer 50 years ago. What should not be forgotten is how well Donaire fought up the point of the stoppage. [End Boxing News item]\n\nThe fight won The Ring's annual awards for \"2007 Knockout of the Year\" and \"2007 Upset of the Year.\"\n\nNonito had an impressive amateur career, as well, which included wins against Ron Siler, who made the 2004 U.S. Olympic team, and current pro jr. middleweight prospect James Kirkland.\n\nRegarding his nickname, Nonito said, \"I got my name because I was pretty fast. Like in the gym, I was a lot faster than my brother or other fighters. They started calling me that around my fourth, fifth fight.\"\n\nFight by Fight - 2010 - in his last fight on 2-13-10 in Las Vegas, NV, he knocked out former WBO interim mini-flyweight world champion and late substitute Manuel Vargas (26-4-1): Nonito was originally scheduled to defend the WBA title against Gerson Guerrero, but Guerrero failed his eye exam; Vargas took the fight on short notice, and it was changed to a nontitle fight; Nonito quickly overpowered Vargas - he scored a knockdown with a left uppercut in the 3rd round, and Vargas was counted out at 1:33; after the fight, Nonito said, \"It didn't matter who I was fighting. I was able to figure him out early, and I knew in the first round he was feeling my power.

I thought I was going to be able to take him out with my power punches and he ran into them, but he was absolutely a lot bigger than I was, and that was absolutely the key factor in this fight. If he was 115, he would have went down early with all the shots I hit him with. I thought I fought a good, smart fight and that I was in control. I'm very pleased.\"...\n\n3RD IBF FL WORLD TITLE DEFENSE - on 4-19-09 in Manila, PH, he TKO'd previously undefeated Raul Martinez (24-0): the fight headlined at Araneta Coliseum, and Nonito domoinated; he scored two knockdowns in the 1st round - the first with a left uppercut, the second with a right hand; he scored another knockdown with a right hand in the 2nd round; Nonito scored another knockdown with a left uppercut in the 4th round, and the referee stopped the fight at 2:42; after three rounds, Nonito led by scores of 30-24 on all three scorecards; after the fight, Nonito said, \"I knew if I hit him, I would hurt him.

I came in here as an underdog. Nobody believed in me,  but I did it. I said yesterday that one punch can make a difference between me and him. I think the key for me in tonight's fight was every time Darchinyan threw and landed, I punched back and that got him thinking. It took the bully out of him. I've fought guys who were heavier than Darchinyan, so I timed my shots. He has heavy hands, but my brother told me he's not as tough as he thinks he is. I shut him up and he still wouldn't admit in the ring after the fight that I beat him. I feel so unbelievably great, it hasn't even dawned on me yet what I have accomplished. This fight wasn't just for me. It was for my family and the Filipino people, too. I could feel their energy tonight.  I felt so good in the ring.\"...\n\nOn 5-12-07 in Reno, NV, he TKO'd Kevin Hudgins (5-9): Nonito staggered Hudgins a few times in the 1st round, and the referee stopped the fight at 2:29; after the fight, Nonito said, \"The first minute, I was rusty. I felt the rust. I got my way through it. The way my power is, all I have to do is get in shape. I heard he was very durable.

I was in a lot of pain, especially after the seventh round. It made for me being off balance for a lot of the fight. I couldn't use my left hand as much as I wanted, but I knew I had to keep trying to use it and fight through the pain. I give Kahren a lot of credit. He is a really nice guy and fought his heart out, but I definitely thought I won the fight.\"...\n\n2005 - on 11-5-05 in Stateline, NV, he won an 8 round unanimous decision against Ilido Julio (33-6-1): the fight was on the undercard of the Jeff Lacy-Scott Pemberton main event, and Nonito dominated; Julio pressed forward, but Nonito boxed and counterpunched effectively, and Julio was penalized one point in the 4th round for low blows; scored 79-70 on all three scorecards...\n\nOn 10-1-05 in Reno, NV, he knocked out Daniel Gonzalez (3-1): the fight was on the undercard of the James Toney-Dominick Guinn main event; Nonito scored two knockdowns in the 1st round, and Gonzalez was counted out at 2:19...\n\nOn 7-2-05 in Las Vegas he won a 6 round unanimous decision against Larry Olvera (5-4-1): the fight was on the undercard of the Samuel Peter-Taurus Sykes main event; Nonito was very impressive - he scored one knockdown in the 1st round and another in the 2nd, and won by scores of 60-52, 59-53, 59-53...\n\nOn 5-13-05 in San Jose, CA, he TKO'd late substitute Paulino Villalobos (23-29-2): Villalobos took the fight on one day's notice; he pressed forward and gave a good effort, but Nonito dominated the fight; he consistently outworked Villalobos and landed the harder punches; he cut Villalobos over the left eye in the 4th round and over the right eye in the 5th, and the referee stopped the fight after the 6th round...\n\n2004 - on 11-12-04 in Montebello, CA, he won an 8 round unanimous decision against Gilberto Bolanos (3-6-1): Nonito scored two knockdowns in the first round and dominated the fight; scored 80-70, 79-71, 79-71; after the fight, Nonito said, \"He was a tough guy. I give him credit. I could not believe he would get up from the knockdowns. I wanted to knock him out, but a win is a win. I'm happy with the victory, but I was disappointed that I wasn't able to finish him off. I want to stay at 115 pounds. I'm confident in my power for a fighter my size.\"...\n\nOn 6-18-04 in Montebello he TKO'd Ricardo Barrera (16-4-1): Barrera started to swell around his eyes in the 1st round; the swelling worsened as the fight progressed, and the referee stopped the fight on the injury after the 4th round; after the fight, Nonito said, \"He is a tough guy with a big heart.

I was 10 years old when we moved to the States. I have two brothers and one sister. Glenn is three years older than me, he's the eldest of the family. [note: Glenn Donaire was an accomplished amateur who also competed in the 2000 Olympic Trials, and is now a professional]...\n\n            \"Glenn started boxing before I did, about a year, and he was bringing trophies and getting attention from everybody. It was really cool, how he felt, how the smile was on his face, and I wanted to bring that smile to everybody - I wanted to bring some of my accomplishments, too. I was 11 when I got started, and I've been hooked.\n\n\"My dad had never trained anybody before us. We were his first fighters. He fought, he was in karate, boxing, all kind of martial arts, he was in the military in the Philippines. It was more of a street-fight thing. But he had never trained anybody. He didn't hardly know how to do anything. The first night that we did mitts with him it was so awkward, so funny, that we just started cracking up right in the middle of the ring. Eventually, we stepped it up and he went way beyond the other coaches' talent.\n\n\"I had 68 wins and eight losses as an amateur. I was in the Nationals every year, I fought with the best at that time. The only international I fought was for the JOs International in Puebla, Mexico.\n\n\"I moved back to the Philippines for about a year, I think it was in 2001 to 2002. I've been back here in California since then.\"...\n\n            Nonito and Rachel Marcial were married on August 8, 2008, in a private ceremony at Stewart's Cove in Carmel, California...\n\nAMATEUR HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n2000 NATIONAL JUNIOR OLYMPICS, Marquette, Mich., 106 pounds - GOLD MEDALIST: in the quarterfinals on 6-23-00 he won a 5-0 decision against Manuel Perez of Denver, Colo.; in the semifinals on 6-24-00 he won on walkover against Dat Nguyen of of Woliluku, Hi.; in the finals on 6-25-00 he won a 3-2 decision against James Kirkland of Austin, Tex....\n\n2000 OLYMPIC TRIALS, Tampa, Fla., 106 pounds: in the quarterfinals on 2-9-00 he won a 19-7 decision against Ron Siler of Cincinnati, Oh.

It was controversial, and knowing that my goal was in my grasp, just right there, it broke my heart. After the decision, people were booing and throwing chairs. It was a fight to remember. There was actually a protest, my brother did a protest, because he beat Viloria more than I ever did. He walked him down like he was nothing. They offered me a scholarship at Northern Michigan, but it was something I turned down. So I turned pro.\n\n\"If I had won the Challenge bracket, we would have to pay our own way to go to, I think it was Boston. We didn't have enough money to do that, so I didn't fight. I thought it was worthless. I had beat that guy in the Nationals in January. I stopped him in the third round. He was so happy, knowing that I wouldn't go in there with him. I knew I would lose by decision even if I won the fight. That happens too much in the amateurs.\"...\n\n2000 U.S. NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS, Colorado Springs, Colo., 106 pounds - GOLD MEDALIST: in his first fight on 1-12-00 in he won a 22-8 decision against Raul Martinez of San Antonio, Tex.; in the quarterfinals on 1-13-00 he stopped Robert Ceron of Doraville, Ga., at 0:49 of the 4th round; in the semifinals on 1-14-00 he stopped Karoz Norman of St. Louis, Mo., at 0:40 of the 3rd round; in the finals on 1-15-00 he won on walkover against Aaron Todd of Troup, Tex...\n\n1999 INTERNATIONAL JUNIOR OLYMPICS, Mexico City, Mexico, 106 pounds - GOLD MEDALIST: in the quarterfinals he drew a bye; in the semifinals he won a 6-0 decision against Miguel Lopez of Mexico; in the finals he won a 7-6 decision against Isidro Granados of Mexico...\n\nSTRENGTHS: Has good skills, speed, and movement...has good punching power in both hands...physically strong, is always in top condition...is experienced against top opposition...had a strong amateur background...\n\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE: 24 fights...128 total rounds...23 world championship rounds...12 interim world championship rounds...\n\nAVERAGE LENGTH OF BOUTS: 5.3 rounds...\n\nKNOCKOUT PERCENTAGE: 65 \u0025...\n\nDISTANCE FIGHTS: 12 rounds - 2 (2-0)...10 rounds - 1 (1-0)...\n\nHe debuted at the age of 18 on 2-22-01 in Inglewood and knocked out Jose Lazaro (1-3-1): at 1:46 of the 1st round...","talking_about_count":4764,"username":"nonitodonaire","website":"www.FilipinoFlash.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"105584362039","name":"Nonito Donaire Jr.","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nonitodonaire","likes":188297,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151571783317040","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/529390_10151571783317040_751258436_n.jpg","offset_y":19,"offset_x":0}}

El f\u00fatbol de toque de bal\u00f3n con jugadores de gran t\u00e9cnica que impuso el denominado Dream Team de Johan Cruyff ten\u00eda su gozne en este centrocampista de t\u00e9cnica depurada que protege el bal\u00f3n como nadie y \"lee\" con admirable sencillez el ritmo que debe adquirir el partido en cada fase del juego. Al t\u00e9rmino de la Eurocopa de 2008, que gan\u00f3 la selecci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola por segunda vez en la historia, fue elegido Mejor Jugador del torneo, una distinci\u00f3n que raramente recae en un centrocampista y que reconoc\u00eda su fundamental aportaci\u00f3n. Xavi fue adem\u00e1s una pieza esencial en la consecuci\u00f3n del \"triplete\" del Bar\u00e7a (que gan\u00f3 en 2009 la Liga, la Copa del Rey y la Champions League) y en el triunfo de la selecci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola en el Mundial de Sud\u00e1frica en 2010, en el que Espa\u00f1a se proclam\u00f3 por primera vez campeona del mundo.\n\n\nXavi Hern\u00e1ndez\n\nSu progenitor, que fue jugador del Sabadell, le inculc\u00f3 la pasi\u00f3n por el f\u00fatbol. Los ojeadores del F\u00fatbol Club Barcelona le siguieron en varios partidos infantiles de la ciudad egarense a instancias del padre. Por fin, a los once a\u00f1os, hizo una prueba y en julio de 1991 ingres\u00f3 en la Masia, la residencia de las futuras estrellas del Bar\u00e7a que no proceden de la Ciudad Condal. Xavi se fij\u00f3 de inmediato en su maestro Josep Guardiola, su actual entrenador y figura clave del Dream Team en aquel entonces. Mir\u00e1ndose en aquel espejo, su progresi\u00f3n fue tan mete\u00f3rica que el propio Guardiola, que un d\u00eda lo observaba desde la banda en un partido de juveniles, pronostic\u00f3 a sus compa\u00f1eros: \"\u00c9ste nos va a jubilar a todos\". M\u00e1s o menos as\u00ed ser\u00eda. Xavi se convirti\u00f3 en el sucesor natural de Guardiola, a pesar de que de la cantera surgir\u00edan otros excelentes organizadores que se vieron obligados a abandonar las filas del club, como Cesc F\u00e1bregas o Vlikel Arteta, que disputan la Premier League inglesa y escocesa, respectivamente.\n\nSu predisposici\u00f3n para aprender cosas, la madurez que irradiaba a tan corta edad y su calidad futbol\u00edstica propiciaron que en la temporada 1997-1998 pasara del juvenil al Barca B, en el que de inmediato se convirti\u00f3 en el \"cerebro\" del equipo. Un equipo en el que Xavi no s\u00f3lo mandaba y organizaba, sino que marcaba goles con facilidad gracias a sus inesperadas llegadas al \u00e1rea y a su maestr\u00eda en el lanzamiento de faltas con barrera. Ya entonces, a pesar de su baja estatura (1,70 m) y su menuda complexi\u00f3n (pesa 63 kilos cuando est\u00e1 en plena forma), ser\u00eda un maestro en la conducci\u00f3n del bal\u00f3n y en la protecci\u00f3n del mismo.\n\nEn la temporada siguiente altern\u00f3 sus actuaciones con el B y con el primer equipo, con el que debut\u00f3 el 18 de agosto de 1998 de la mano del t\u00e9cnico neerland\u00e9s Louis Van Gaal, en un partido de la Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a ante el Real Mallorca. Fue titular y, adem\u00e1s, marc\u00f3 un gol. Van Gaal lo hizo debutar en la Liga el 3 de octubre de aquel mismo a\u00f1o en el Mestalla frente al Valencia, que cay\u00f3 derrotado por 1-3. Sus intermitentes actuaciones con el primer equipo dieron alas a un Bar\u00e7a alica\u00eddo que ocupaba la d\u00e9cima posici\u00f3n de la tabla. Xavi marc\u00f3 un gol decisivo que dio la victoria a su equipo en el campo del Valladolid, y a partir de aquella victoria, contando m\u00e1s asiduamente con su presencia, los azulgranas remontaron de forma tan espectacular que ganar\u00edan la Liga 1998-1999. Era su segundo t\u00edtulo profesional, porque poco antes hab\u00eda ganado el Campeonato del Mundo Sub-20 disputado en Nigeria.\n\n\n \nEn la temporada 1999-2000, debido a una lesi\u00f3n de Guardiola, Xavi se consolid\u00f3 en el primer equipo. Convencido de sus posibilidades, su juego madur\u00f3 exponencialmente. Entretanto, su estelar actuaci\u00f3n en Nigeria propici\u00f3 que el 15 de noviembre de 2000 debutara con la selecci\u00f3n absoluta ante los Pa\u00edses Bajos. Pocos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s ya ser\u00eda convocado regularmente para defender los colores de Espa\u00f1a. A partir de la temporada 2000-2001, y con la marcha de Guardiola al calcio italiano, Xavi se convirti\u00f3 en titular indiscutible, tanto con Van Gaal como con los entrenadores subsiguientes: Carles Reixach, Radomir Antic y Frank Rijkaard. En el Barca, sin embargo, no alcanzar\u00eda su tercer t\u00edtulo, el de Liga, hasta el 14 de mayo de 2005, tras una marcha penosa del equipo y del club por un desierto de desprop\u00f3sitos. En verano del mismo a\u00f1o se proclam\u00f3 campe\u00f3n de la Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, t\u00edtulo que renovar\u00eda al a\u00f1o siguiente, en el que en el partido de vuelta marc\u00f3 un gol decisivo ante el Real Club Espa\u00f1ol, al que los azulgranas superaron por 3-0.\n\nHabitualmente las lesiones lo respetaban, por lo que siempre estuvo en forma cuando se requer\u00eda su participaci\u00f3n. S\u00f3lo cabe mencionar una rotura del ligamento cruzado anterior de la rodilla derecha en un entrenamiento en el Camp Nou, en diciembre de 2005. Aquel percance trunc\u00f3 su proyecci\u00f3n al obligarlo a estar ausente durante cinco meses, hasta finales de abril de 2006, fecha en que reapareci\u00f3 ante el C\u00e1diz C. F. Aquel a\u00f1o los azulgranas consiguieron de nuevo el t\u00edtulo de Liga y la Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a. Pero el mayor momento de gloria de aquel a\u00f1o 2006 para un equipo que funcionaba como una m\u00e1quina (gracias al trabajo de Xavi y Andr\u00e9s Iniesta en la medular y las genialidades de Ronaldinho y Eto'o en la delantera) lleg\u00f3 con la victoria en la Liga de Campeones, la asignatura pendiente del Bar\u00e7a, que s\u00f3lo ten\u00eda en sus vitrinas la conseguida por el Dream Team en 1992. Xavi, sin embargo, no pudo participar en la final ante el Arsenal F. C. debido a su baja forma por la lesi\u00f3n.\n\n\nCelebrando junto a Iniesta la Champions 2009\n\nEn 2007, en el partido de Liga de Campeones ante el Olympique de Lyon, disputado el 19 de septiembre, Xavi igual\u00f3 a Migueli como jugador del F. C. Barcelona que m\u00e1s partidos hab\u00eda disputado en competiciones europeas (85). Y super\u00f3 al m\u00edtico central ceut\u00ed el 2 de octubre de aquel mismo a\u00f1o en un partido frente al VfB Stuttgart. La diferencia, por supuesto, seguir\u00eda aumentando. En cuanto a sus partidos con el Bar\u00e7a, el 24 de noviembre de 2007 y ante el club decano espa\u00f1ol, el Recreativo de Huelva, igual\u00f3 la cifra de 400 partidos oficiales que ostentaba Guardiola.\n\nPero sin el t\u00edtulo de Campe\u00f3n de Europa de Naciones de 2008, en la que Xavi explot\u00f3 al m\u00e1ximo unas cualidades que no prodigaba (pases en profundidad al delantero con mayor ventaja y chutes desde fuera del \u00e1rea), no habr\u00eda ocupado las primeras p\u00e1gina de la prensa. En esa Eurocopa, disputada en Austria y Suiza, el centrocampista azulgrana, adoctrinado por Luis Aragon\u00e9s, adelant\u00f3 su posici\u00f3n con \u00e9xito rotundo. Marc\u00f3 su primer gol el 26 de junio frente a Rusia. Y en la final ante Alemania, Xavi dio el pase de gol a Fernando Torres, quien marc\u00f3 el \u00fanico tanto del encuentro. Su actuaci\u00f3n en la Eurocopa le vali\u00f3 el premio al Mejor Jugador de la competici\u00f3n, una menci\u00f3n que habitualmente recae en un delantero goleador. Los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, sin embargo, coincidieron en que era una elecci\u00f3n acertada. Adem\u00e1s de esta distinci\u00f3n mayor, Xavi hab\u00eda sido galardonado como el mejor futbolista de las temporadas 1998-1999 y 2004-2005 por la revista deportiva Don Bal\u00f3n, y ya en 1999 hab\u00eda recibido el premio El Pa\u00eds como futbolista revelaci\u00f3n.\n\n\nCon David Villa en la final de la Eurocopa 2008\n\nSi con la selecci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola hab\u00eda vivido uno de los mejores momentos al ganar la Eurocopa, la temporada 2008-2009 le reservaba a\u00fan un destino superior: ser parte esencial, junto con Iniesta, de la organizaci\u00f3n del juego del F.C. Barcelona en la que fue sin duda la mejor temporada de la historia del club. El Bar\u00e7a, en efecto, logr\u00f3 algo tan ins\u00f3lito en el f\u00fatbol mundial como el \"triplete\", la victoria en los tres torneos en que participaba: la Liga espa\u00f1ola, la Copa del Rey y la Champions League. El juego exhibido por el equipo maravill\u00f3 a todo el mundo; por supuesto que fue el nuevo entrenador, su admirado Josep Guardiola, el principal art\u00edfice de esa revoluci\u00f3n, pero tales \u00e9xitos no son concebibles sin organizadores de la talla de Iniesta y del propio Xavi.\n\nLa temporada 2009-2010 sum\u00f3 su quinto t\u00edtulo liguero a su palmar\u00e9s, tras una re\u00f1id\u00edsima competici\u00f3n en la que el F\u00fatbol Club Barcelona y el Real Madrid alcanzaron registros vertiginosos tanto en goles como en puntos, ganando 31 de los 38 partidos disputados. El Bar\u00e7a, que se anot\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n la Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, no pudo sin embargo revalidar su victoria en la Champions League al caer en semifinales.\n\nFinalizada la temporada, el Mundial de Sud\u00e1frica de 2010 deparar\u00eda a Xavi el \u00faltimo t\u00edtulo que le quedaba por ganar. Pese a la decepcionante derrota inicial frente a Suiza, la selecci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola entrenada por Vicente del Bosque se mantuvo fiel a su estilo, y de la mano de Xavi y de sus restantes cerebros centrocampistas (Iniesta, Xabi Alonso, Cesc F\u00e0begras) encaden\u00f3 una victoria tras otra hasta derrotar a Alemania en las semifinales y a Holanda en la final. Por primera vez, despu\u00e9s de d\u00e9cadas \u201csin pasar de cuartos\u201d, Espa\u00f1a se proclamaba campeona del mundo.\n\nJugador m\u00e1s bien fr\u00edo en el campo, sus compa\u00f1eros alaban su entereza y su capacidad para remontar un partido que parece perdido. No va de estrella medi\u00e1tica, aunque cualquier equipo de \u00e9lite estar\u00eda encantado de contar con sus servicios.

Matthew Hayden AM lived that dream during Australian cricket\u2019s golden era \u2013 when Australia dominated world cricket and when Matthew dominated the world\u2019s bowlers.\n\nMatthew played 103 tests for Australia, was rated the world\u2019s best Test batsman from 1996-2006, and was awarded the Allan Border Medal as the best Australian player of the year in 2001. One of the most decorated opening batsman in cricketing history, Hayden was known for his aggressive batting and his ruthless on-field sledging.\n\nMatthew, who recently won the IPL Championship and The Champions League Trophy with the Chennai Super Kings, is a powerful and aggressive left-handed opening batsman, known for his ability to score quickly at both Test and one-day levels. He formed one of the most prolific opening partnerships in world Test cricket for Australia with Justin Langer, and in ODI cricket with Adam Gilchrist. \n","birthday":"10\/29\/1971","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Kingaroy","state":"QLD","country":"Australia","zip":""},"personal_info":"Matthew is now the CEO of his own company, The Hayden Way, and ambassador for the McGrath Foundation, Australian Indigenous Education Foundation, Macquarie Group Foundation and Champagnat Trust at Marist College Ashgrove. These contributions undoubtedly cement Matthew as a valued Australian, an achievement recognised recently when he was awarded a \u2018Member of the Order of Australia\u2019.\n\nOn retirement from international cricket Matthew announced his belief in Indigenous Australia and his commitment to finding the \u201cnext Indigenous Australian to wear the Baggy Green\u201d. \n\n Matthew recently founded The Tiwi College Project, which seeks to improve the general health and well being of disadvantaged indigenous youth by addressing obvious health challenges and improving educational opportunities. \n\n\"I am incredibly enthusiastic about this project. The people of this small community are also great lovers of cricket and have a strong interest in sport and the learning and pathways that their involvement in sport can create.\"\n\nMatthew Hayden lives in Queensland with his wife Kellie, daughter Grace and two sons Joshua and Thomas. It is here that Matthew embarked on a business venture that allowed him to inspire people to live a more self-sufficient, sustainable and enriched lifestyle through The Hayden Way.\n\nThe country boy from Kingaroy rose to greatness in the cricket world. Here is the superstar batsman, family man, the surfer, fisherman and chef at the helm of an innovative business that will be as bold and powerful as the man himself.\n\n\nUntil recently, Hayden held the record for the highest scores made by an Australian batsman in both the Test (380) and One Day International (181 not out) arenas. He formed one of the most prolific opening partnerships in world Test cricket for Australia with Justin Langer, and in ODI cricket with Adam Gilchrist. Upon his retirement, in January 2009, Hayden's Test average was 50.7; he had scored the second most runs in Test Cricket by an opening batsman; and was equal 6th (with Jacques Kallis) on the all-time list for Test centuries.\n\nHayden finished his playing days with Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League which resulted in the team winning both the Champions League and the IPL 2010. A fitting way to celebrate a remarkable career spaning almost 2 decades. In the second edition of the IPL (2009) in South Africa, Hayden was the Orange Cap Leader (Leading Run Scorer), scoring 572 runs at an average of 52 in only 12 innings.","talking_about_count":9763,"website":"http:\/\/www.thehaydenway.com http:\/\/twitter\/HaydosTweets http:\/\/facebook.com\/OpSunshine","were_here_count":0,"id":"41928427787","name":"Matthew Hayden","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Matthew-Hayden\/41928427787","likes":375394,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151847206372788","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/21806_10151847206372788_1275899330_n.jpg","offset_y":26,"offset_x":0}}

Thank you to everyone who has liked this page.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"This page is in no way affiliated with Dale Junior and is a fan page built by the fans and updated for the fans.  \n\nEarly career\n\nEarnhardt, Jr. was born in Kannapolis, North Carolina to Brenda Lorraine Gee and Ralph Dale Earnhardt, Sr. His maternal grandfather was a NASCAR car builder.  He began his Racing career at the late age of 17, competing in the Street Stock division at Concord (N.C.) Motorsport Park. His first race car was a 1979 Monte Carlo that he co-owned with older half-brother Kerry. Within two seasons, the young Earnhardt, Jr. had honed his driving abilities to the point of joining the Late Model Stock Car division. There he developed an in-depth knowledge of chassis setup and car preparation, while racing against Kerry and Dale's sister Kelley Earnhardt-Elledge. Junior ran 9 Busch Series races between 1996 and 1997 for Dale Earnhardt Inc. and Ed Whitaker, respectively, before driving for Dale Earnhardt Inc. in the Busch Series full time in 1998. Earnhardt, Jr. won consecutive NASCAR Busch Series Championships in 1998 and 1999 over Matt Kenseth. Also in 1999 he drove in 5 Winston Cup races in the #8 Budweiser Chevrolet for Dale Earnhardt Inc., then in 2000 he went full time in the Winston Cup series.\n\nAfter much speculation, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. announced on May 10, 2007, that he would leave Dale Earnhardt Inc., the company founded by his father, to drive for another team in 2008. Earnhardt expressed that his decision was based entirely on his desires to achieve his career goal of a Sprint Cup Championship, and his apparent belief that he would not be able to attain that objective while driving for DEI. He said that unless he could gain majority ownership, and therefore control, of DEI, that he was not confident in the organization\u2019s ability to field the elite level equipment that would yield the elusive title\nDale Earnhardt Jr. (left) standing between of two different paint schemes for the #88 Chevy.

He stands with Lt. Gen. Clyde Vaughn, director of the Army National Guard, and Rick Hendrick, in Dallas where the announcement was made on September 19, 2007.\n\nOn June 13, 2007, he announced at a press conference that he had signed a five-year contract with Hendrick Motorsports, replacing Kyle Busch. He has joined Hendrick which is the team of Jimmie Johnson, Jeff Gordon and Casey Mears.\n\nOn July 13, 2007, it was announced that his long-time primary sponsor Budweiser would not be with Earnhardt Jr. when he made the move to Hendrick. Other contractual agreements in place at Hendrick Motorsports are said to have prevented a relationship with Bud.[6]\n\nOn August 15, 2007 it was announced that Dale Earnhardt Jr. would not be taking his familiar #8 with him to Hendrick Motorsports in 2008. His late grandfather, Ralph Earnhardt, used that number and Earnhardt Jr. picked it when he entered the Cup Series in 1999. Earnhardt's father also used #8 early in his career. Earnhardt Jr. blamed his stepmother for not allowing the #8 to move with him to Hendrick Motorsports. Earnhardt Jr. said negotiations broke down when Teresa Earnhardt asked for part of the licensing revenue, along with wanting the number back after he retired.\n\nEarnhardt Jr. will move to the #88 car with Tony Eury, Jr. coming to Hendrick to remain as his crew chief. [8] On September 19, the official announcement was made that Earnhardt Jr. would be driving the #88 Mountain Dew AMP\/National Guard Chevy for the 2008 season. \n\nThe #88, according to NASCAR archives, was driven by Ralph Earnhardt, his paternal grandfather, in 1957. His maternal grandfather, Robert Gee, was one of the first employees of All Star Racing, initially a Late Model Sportsman (now Nationwide Series) team with Gee as Hendrick's partner, which is now Hendrick Motorsports. Hendrick said about Earnhardt and his uncles, \"I can look at Robert Gee Jr., or Jimmy Gee, or Dale Jr., and all I see is Robert Gee. They're the spitting image of him. I go back and look and pictures from when we did things together, and I have to say, I owe Robert a lot.\"\n\nIn 2008, Hendrick Motorsports has merged its Nationwide Series team to Dale's JR Motorsports, with the cars coming from Dale's shop, which includes his mother and uncles.\n\n2008\nDale Earnhardt Jr. performing a burnout after his win in the 2008 Budweiser Shootout\nDale Earnhardt Jr. performing a burnout after his win in the 2008 Budweiser Shootout\nEarnhardt at Daytona\nEarnhardt at Daytona\n\nEarnhardt started the season by winning the 2008 Budweiser Shootout, a non-points paying exhibition. It was his first race for Hendrick. He lead for a total of 47 of 70 laps, a Budweiser Shootout record. He followed that up five days later with a win in the Gatorade Duel. This was his third career win in the duels, however he was unable to follow it up with victory in the Daytona 500, finishing 9th. Ryan Newman was the winner of the event.\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr was docked 50 points because his rear spoiler didn't meet the specified height in the Nationwide Series. His crew chief Chad Walter was fined $35,000, suspended for 6 races and was placed on probation until December 31, 2008. Team owner Rick Hendrick was also docked 50 owner points along with Jr. \n\nDale Jr. started 15th for the Auto Club 500 because qualifying was rained out and the lineup will be by owner points from last season. However lap 21, teammate Casey Mears went up into the wall due to water on the track. When he came back down the track he took out Jr. When the cameras caught up with Earnhardt in the garage, he was irritated about the fact that they were even out on the track in those conditions. It had been raining all weekend and water was \"weeping\" out of the cracks on the track causing slick spots in the corners. The race was later rain delayed until Monday and Earnhardt finished the race 40th, dropping him to 23rd (from 8th) in the points standing.\n\nHowever, at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, Junior finished the race second behind Carl Edwards after starting the race 8th. He led 17 laps for 175 total points in the race. After the race, Earnhardt moved from 23rd to 10th in the points standings, 130 points behind the leader, Kyle Busch.\n\nEarnhardt Jr. finished 3rd at the Kobalt Tools 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway to move from 10th to 6th in the points standings. Earnhardt Jr. now has 3 top tens in 4 races with Hendrick Motorsports. ","personal_interests":"Information collected and copied from various sources and interviews on the internet.

{"category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":" Kimbo Slice aka Kevin Ferguson was born on February 8, 1974 and is a Miami, Florida-based street fighter turned mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter. He first appeared in several filmed underground fights which have spread primarily on the Internet. Law enforcement never intervened as the fights were considered consensual. Kimbo has since left street fighting behind and is now putting his efforts towards becoming a professional mixed martial arts fighter. Slice is currently training with retired MMA fighter Bas Rutten.\nFerguson was a star defensive football player for Miami Palmetto High School in the Pinecrest area of Miami, Florida. In college, he went on to the University of Miami on academic scholarship, but did not play football. He was there for only a year and a half.\nAs Kimbo Slice, Ferguson worked as a bodyguard for RK Netmedia, a Miami-based pornography production\/promotion company responsible for a number of popular adult subscription websites, such as MILF Hunter. Rolling Stone called Slice \"The King of the Web Brawlers\".\nOne of Slice's most notable fights was a controversial late 2004 encounter with Sean Gannon, a former Boston Police officer who trains in MMA. Slice was defeated by Gannon (although Gannon used many moves which were not agreed upon before the fight such as choking and kneeing) and, due to the popularity of the fight video, Gannon began fighting within the Ultimate Fighting Championship.\nSlice made his sanctioned MMA debut against former WBO Heavyweight champion boxer Ray Mercer at Cage Fury Fighting Championships 5, in Atlantic City on June 23, 2007. The match was scheduled as a three-round exhibition utilizing all professional rules of MMA combat. Slice defeated Mercer with a guillotine choke at 1:12 into the first round. In a post-fight interview, Slice stated that he would like to fight David \"Tank\" Abbott. Abbott, who was a spectator, stood up from his seat and accepted the call out. One of the matchmakers for CFFC asked Slice for his assurance so that an October 12th bout at Cage Fury Fighting Championships 6 between Slice and \"Tank\" Abbott could be organized. This event was later canceled due to a promotion dispute. On October 11, 2007, Proelite.com announced that they had signed Slice to a deal and that he would make his debut on the November 10 EliteXC.Originally set to make his professional MMA debut against Mike Bourke, the reformed street fighter was set to face Bo Cantrell after Bourke sustained a shoulder injury.Kimbo defeated Cantrell 19 seconds into the first round by submission due to strikes.\nSlice will be featured on The Iron Ring, a new television series airing on BET which features MMA prospects. Slice will be a part of the selection process for the participants.\nOn February 16th, 2008, Kimbo fought Tank Abbott in the main event at EliteXC: Street Certified. He won by KO 43 seconds into the first round.\nSlice has revealed that he currently lives with his family in Miami, and is the father of six children: three girls and three boys. His first two sons are named Kevin, his first daughter is named Rab and his third son is named Kevlar. His youngest two daughters have names beginning with K.\n\nKIMBO QUOTES:\n\n\u201cKimbo has been my name all my life. Slice was given to me by fans on the Internet. I accept it. It was cool. After the first fight I had with Big D in the backyard, I caught him with a left hook that sliced the bottom of his eye, and I guess broke his whatever. His eyeball came a couple inches down, almost out of his head. They branded me with that name. Ever since then Slice has been part of the name.\"\n ","talking_about_count":1096,"were_here_count":0,"id":"49303644043","name":"Kimbo Slice","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Kimbo-Slice\/49303644043","likes":696403,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150769623269044","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/574749_10150769623269044_209008928_n.jpg","offset_y":17,"offset_x":0}}

Ronaldo's contract with Real Madrid, under the terms of which he is paid \u20ac21 million per year (after taxes), makes him the highest-paid footballer in the world, and his buyout clause is valued at \u20ac1 billion as per his contract.Ronaldo began his career as a youth player for Andorinha, where he played for two years, before moving to C.D.

The number of people that played at a time all depended on how many people were out there. If we had 14 guys show up we would play 7 on 7, but most of the time there were 30 plus so we would play 15 on 15. Basically we had no idea how many were suppose to play at a time. Also, nobody knew what a flick, hammer, scoober, or huck was. We only threw backhands because we knew no better. Even though we weren't that great and didn't know what we were doing we still had a lot of fun! At the time what began as just a fun activity to do after xc or track practice has now become a huge part of my life.\n\nAccepted to University of Florida!!!! Go Gators!!!!\n\n2006 - \n\nI was lucky enough to make the Florida Ultimate Frisbee team my freshman year. Through the season I learned a lot from my teammates (Kurt Gibson, Tim Gehret, Bill MacQueen, and Cyle Van Auken) and my Coach (Kurt Dahlenburg). I played offense that year and got valuable experience on spacing and ways to cut. Winning the National Championship was an amazing team accomplishment and it was awesome to see the Seniors go out on top.\n\n2006 National Champions\n\n2007 - \n\nI knew after losing Callahan winner Tim Gehret and one of our main handlers Bill MacQueen that we would need someone to step up. After being a primary deep receiver my freshman year I knew I had to become more of a threat as a thrower. I worked a lot with Kurt perfecting my flick and worked with Tim on my backhand. It was a very difficult season, but ended up being very rewarding. Nationals that year was very hot. I didn't train hard enough in the off-season to prepare myself and ended up getting what we think was a heat stroke. Playing against Colorado in the Semi's while I was blacking out was an experience I never wanted to go thru again. Unfortunately heat stroke would find me again.\n\n2007 3rd Place (T)\n\n2008 - \n\nEverybody was coming back. We were ready to take the title. Unfortunately we didn't have enough in the Championship game against one of the top 10 college teams in my opinion ever (Wisconsin). It was sad to see the seniors go out like that. Watching Kurt Gibson (one of the best college players to ever play the game) and Cyle Van Auken (maybe the person with the biggest impact on the Florida Program) leave like that put a terrible feeling in my stomach.\n\n2008 Runner Up\n\n2009 -\n\nThe year of the biggest heartbreak I have ever been thru. We crushed everyone that year. We felt untouchable and we acted like it. We would beat you on the field and then tell your girlfriend about it afterwards. We went into Sectionals and joked around the entire time disrespecting our opponents as well as the game. Going into Regionals we felt as confident as ever. Some would say we got what we deserved. Miguel went down with a fracture in his heel. Chris was cramping so bad he couldn't stand up. And for me I was hit with a heat stroke even worse than 2007. With 3 of our top players out or hurting we lost to a very solid Virginia team. We went down into the backdoor games and players that had only seen the field in garbage time were now playing in the biggest points of our season. Everyone battled, but it wasn't enough. NC State played a incredible game against us and got the last ticket to Nationals. This moment in my career I decided that I would never let something like this happen again.\n\n2009 Regional Qualifier\n\n2010 -\n\nRedemption! We started off 2010 the same way we started 2009. Thinking we were better than everyone we played on and off the field. I had to leave the team after Stanford Invite to get my life back on track. After a few weeks I was ready to return and asked if the team would take me back. After a long meeting I discussed how I wanted the team to change. I wanted to play with more respect for ourselves and our opponents. I never worked harder in my life on and off the field. We all worked our tails off. I had a great workout routine (gym 5-6 times a week, biking, swimming, and running). When we hit nationals we were not going to be denied. Winning it all just made everything so worth it and put my life in such a better perspective. I want to thank everyone that has helped my get to the point I'm at in life. My family, friends, teammates, coaches, and my savior Jesus Christ. I am forever grateful.\n\n2010 NATIONAL CHAMPIONS","talking_about_count":10858,"username":"BrodieSmith21","website":"http:\/\/youtube.com\/brodiesmith21","were_here_count":0,"id":"103677859716108","name":"Brodie Smith","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BrodieSmith21","likes":111196,"cover":{"cover_id":563370377080185,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/1482807_563370377080185_205973736_n.jpg","offset_y":43,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The Official Facebook Page of 49ers Wide Receiver Anquan Boldin - Super Bowl XLVII Champion, 2003 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, 3 Time NFC Pro Bowler.","affiliation":"San Francisco 49ers","birthday":"10\/03\/1980","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"As one of the most prolific athletes in Palm Beach County history, Anquan Boldin has had a remarkable athletic career at the high school, collegiate, and professional level. Entering his 10th NFL year, Boldin has received countless accolades, including three-time Pro Bowl performer, NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, 2010 Ravens Walter Payton Man of the Year, and the Palm Beach County Sports Hall of Fame 2012 inductee, to name a few. As a Ravens player, Boldin has recorded the fastest player in NFL history to record 600 career receptions, reaching the milestone on 9\/26\/10 vs. Cle. in his 98th career game. Boldin also earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week in 2010.\n\nWhile a Cardinal, Anquan made enormous achievements with five, 1,000 yard seasons.  This past season, On November 15, 2009 in a game against the Seattle Seahawks, Boldin became the fifth fastest NFL player ever to gain 7,000 receiving yards.  In 2008 Anquan helped lead his team to their first ever Superbowl as well as his third Pro Bowl season.  Anquan demonstrated true team player skills and leadership that season after a triumphant return from a horrific hit causing surgery procedures to correct a fractured facial bone.\n\nIn 2006, Anquan was seventh in the league in receiving yards with 1,203 and was selected to his second Pro Bowl. It was his third, 1,000-yard season.\n\nIn 2004, Anquan was named a Walter Payton Man of the Year finalist. This award is given by the NFL in recognition of players in off-the-field community service as well and playing with excellence.  That same year he was also awarded the Ed Block Courage Award by the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nA second-round draft choice in 2003, Boldin became the most prolific rookie receiver in league annals, with 101 receptions (which broke the record of 98 held by New England\u2019s Terry Glenn in 1996). The only rookie selected to the 2004 Pro Bowl, Boldin recorded five 100-yard games in his rookie season and was the only receiver to post a 100-yard game for the Cardinals in 2004. In his first professional season, Boldin caught at least three passes in all 16 games and his five 100-yard receiving games were the most by Cardinal since 1998 (Frank Sanders, 5).\n\nFormer quarterback for Florida State, he was the consummate team player. As a senior in 2002, he led the Seminoles in receiving a large tally of notable stats, including 65 receptions for 1,011 yards (15.6-yard average) and 13 touchdowns. During his time there, he rushed 21 times for 86 yards (4.1\u2013 yard average) and completed 7 of 16 passes (43.8 percent) for 111 yards and a score. He played receiver and quarterback in the final college game versus Georgia in the Sugar Bowl, had 3 receptions for 34 yards, and a 5-yard touchdown. He completed 6 of 14 passes for 78 yards and a 40-yard score, as well as added 34 rushing yards on 13 carries.\n\nAnquan began the Anquan Boldin \u201cQ81\u2033 Foundation during his sophomore season with a mission to bring hope to underprivileged children. Well-known throughout the league for his work ethic, his character, and his professionalism, Anquan is also known for his generosity in giving back to his community as evidenced by his charitable activities in both Arizona and his home state of Florida.  This past summer, Pahokee Middle\/High School was named the Anquan Boldin Stadium. He is also proud to have been awarded the \u201cDistinguished Service\u201d and \u201cKey To The City\u201d Awards for His Generosity and Positive Leadership in the Pahokee Community.","talking_about_count":6124,"username":"OfficialAnquanBoldin","website":"http:\/\/www.q81.org","were_here_count":0,"id":"163834243647585","name":"Anquan Boldin","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OfficialAnquanBoldin","likes":130151,"cover":{"cover_id":626367827394222,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1239463_626367827394222_1708755644_n.jpg","offset_y":39,"offset_x":0}}

Ch\u00e1ra spent four seasons with the Islanders organization, becoming a reliable stay at home defender in a primarily defensive role. He earned a reputation as a tough player to play against \u2013 intimidating, physically strong, and a punishing hitter who could, on occasion, fight. His physical strength also gave him a very hard slap shot, which seemed to improve each season, although Ch\u00e1ra was never deployed in an offensive role as an Islander. He was traded to the Ottawa Senators during the 2001 NHL Entry Draft as part of a deal to acquire forward Alexei Yashin. At the time, it was believed that the deal would vastly improve the Islanders, who were never a contending team when Ch\u00e1ra played there.

In 2007 he attempted and landed a world first \u201cSushi Roll\u201d a manoeuvre he named during a photo trip to Japan. In 2008 he became the youngest ever recipient of the Surfer Poll award for \u201cBest Performance of the Year\u201d for his part in Quiksilver's Young Guns III. In 2010 Julian released his own signature film titled \u201cScratching the Surface\u201d that involved a one-year hiatus from competition.\n\nDuring filming Julian busted foot and his break from surfing in events was extended.

Sensationally losing for the first time in his professional career to Columbian bruiser Breidis Prescott in September 2008 - the tempest of conjecture and condemnation fuelled media frenzy was followed in quick succession by a grueling and inspirational new training regime with Coach Freddie Roach in L.A.\n\nThe boy from Bolton came back to the ring with brutal vengeance as he sent Oisin Fagan flailing to the floor in December 2008. Khan did not just convincingly put the boy down for a compelling victory - he exuded a fresh, calm, persona; a measured aggressor spearing his prey with a jab as he circled, finding his target and then unleashing a flurry of blows, taking him apart and sending him to the floor twice inside the first round\u2026 97 seconds into the second it was all over.\n\nKhan's World Title Fight in July 2009 with Kotelnik was an extremely intense match. Both were on top form but it was Khan\u2019s display of speed, stamina and boxing skill that saw him victorious.\n\nLiving to box has been a self proclaimed obsession for Amir Khan; one that has turned him from a talented streetwise boy, into a self assured man and not forgetting to mention, World Champion.\n\nIf you were to ask anyone about Amir Khan's talent, they would undoubtedly say he was born to be a boxer. His calm exterior unnerving to his opponents; his craving to win making him faster and stronger than others; these are but a few reasons why he has become not only a winner, but an icon.\n\nThe fight between Amir Khan and Andreas Kotelnik did not start of as expected. Due to an unfortunate injury, Kotelnik had to postpone the fight until July 18th, subsequently delaying Amir Khan from holding the World Light Welterweight Champion title by just under a month.\n\nThere was a distinct buzz on the night of the match. Everyone who attended the fight or watched it on television could tell that this fight would be a defining moment for Khan. 12 rounds later and that moment arrived, propelling the Bolton Boxer to staggering new heights in his career.\n\nThose who know and train with Khan have expressed their delight at the victory. Freddie Roach exclaimed \"I love bringing the best out of people and he's more of a complete fighter now. He feints better and goes to the body, like an old school fighter. People were saying Amir was done after getting knocked out by Prescott, but in three fights he is world champion.'","birthday":"12\/08\/1986","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"Premier House, Prince Street, Bolton","city":"Bolton","state":"","country":"United Kingdom","zip":"BL1 2NP"},"personal_info":"Bringing you all the latest news, stories, videos, photos, polls, competitions, exclusive content, direct messages and much more from Team Khan and Amir himself!","personal_interests":"Amir of course loves Boxing.

Fan Page NON ufficiale.","bio":"DIEGO ARMANDO MARADONA\n \nMaradona nasce il 30 ottobre 1960 nel quartiere povero di Villa Florito, nella periferia di Buenos Aires, dove trascorre i giorni di bambino giocando per strada e dimostrando gi\u00e0 sprazzi di talento definito unanimamente divino. \nLa sua carriera inizia nell'argentinos Junior, per poi proseguire, sempre in Argentina, nelle fila del Boca Juniors (squadra della quale Maradona \u00e8 sempre rimasto accesissimo tifoso). \nEsordisce a livello internazionale con la nazionale giovanile argentina (con cui vincer\u00e0 il titolo mondiale nel 1979) e da li a poco verr\u00e0 inserito nella nazionale maggiore. \nDopo il mondiale del 1982 in Spagna, viene ingaggiato dal Barcellona e approda finalmente sul palcoscenico del calcio europeo. \nIn spagna Diego gioca per due stagioni, collezionando prestazioni memorabili e un terribile infortunio (Goicoechea, difensore dell'Athletic Bilbao, gli frattura la caviglia sinistra e gli rompe i legamenti con un'entrata assassina). \nNel 1984 l'evento che segna la svolta nella vita calcistica di Maradona: il 30\/06\/1984 firma un contratto con il Napoli. \nLa citt\u00e0 partenopea adotta subito Dieguito a suo idolo e il calore dei tifosi viene ricambiato dall'amore che sempre Maradona manifester\u00e0 nei confronti di quella che diventer\u00e0 la sua \"seconda patria\". \nCon il Napoli Diego raggiunge i traguardi pi\u00f9 prestigiosi: 2 scudetti, 1 coppa italia, 1 coppa UEFA e una supercoppa italiana. \nE' il periodo pi\u00f9 felice di Maradona: ai successi sul campo si affiancano una condizione fisica e tecnica all'apice e una fama inarrivabile nel mondo, in questo periodo Diego E' il calcio. \nNel frattempo trascina la nazionale Argentina alla vittoria nei mondiali del 1986 in Messico: Maradona disputa un torneo strepitoso segnando nella stessa partita due goals(che sarebbero rimasti nella storia) contro l'Inghilterra, uno di mano (la cosiddetta \"mano di Dio\") e il secondo dribblando avversari come birilli e incantando tutti gli appassionati del mondo. \nNegli anni novanta arriva il declino della sua stella: nel 91 viene trovato positivo ad un controllo antidoping in campionato e di conseguenza squalificato per 15 mesi. \nScontata la squalifica Diego rifiuta di tornare al Napoli: l'idillio con la citt\u00e0 \u00e8 rimasto sempre lo stesso, ma i rapporti con la societ\u00e0 sono franati. \nChiede perci\u00f2 di essere ceduto e nel 1992 torna nella Liga spagnola con la maglia del Siviglia. \nL'anno seguente (1993) sembra veder rinascere Diego: ritorna in nazionale e aiuta l'Argentina a superare l'Australia nello spareggio per la qualificazione ai mondiali americani del 94. \nMa ormai la sua carriera ha imboccato il viale del tramonto e tutti gli sportivi soffrono per come questo grande campione riesca a farsi del male: \u00e8 il giugno del 1994, Stati Uniti d'America, campionato mondiale, Diego risulta positivo al test antidoping ed \u00e8 cacciato dalla manifestazione..... \nTorner\u00e0 ancora sui campi da gioco (nel 95 col Boca), ma si tratter\u00e0 solo dell'ombra del campione che fu. \nUna cosa risalta nitidamente agli occhi di tutti gli sportivi: tanto era grande in campo Diego, quanto era debole nella vita. \nLe cronache recenti parlano di un uomo imbolzito, grasso, che fatica a rimettere nei giusti binari una vita rovinata dalla droga, ma chiunque abbia visto un suo goal, una punizione, un dribbling.... o un semplice sorriso che regalava senza protervia, non pu\u00f2 dimenticare il \"Pibe de Oro\", forse il pi\u00f9 grande fantasista del mondo, di certo l'ultimo grande giocatore tutto \"talento e fantasia\" in un calcio gi\u00e0 divenuto troppo tattico e fisico.. \n\nUN BREVE RIASSUNTO DELLA VITA DI MARADONA\n \n30\/10\/1960: Diego Armando Maradona nasce a Lan\u00fas, nella periferia di Buenos Aires.

{"about":"Welcome to FERNANDO TORRES 9 - the facebook fanpage about the best footballer in the world!! Enjoy ;) Your admins www.fb.com\/ft9fan","bio":"Full name: Fernando Jos\u00e9 Torres Sanz\nNickname: El Ni\u00f1o (=\"The Child\")\nDate of birth: 20th March 1984\nPlace of birth: Fuenlabrada, Madrid, Spain\nHeight: 1,86 m (6 ft 1 in)\nWeight: 78 Kg\n\nGirlfriend: Olalla Dom\u00ednguez Liste - now Olalla Torres (birth date: 1 January 1985; wedding date: 27 May 2009)\nDaughter: Nora (birth date: 8 July 2009)\nSon: Leo (birth date: 6 December 2010)\n\nYouth career: \nAtletico Madrid (1995-2001)\n\nSenior career: \nAtletico Madrid (2001-2007), Liverpool (2007-2011), Chelsea (since 2011)\n\nNational team: \nSpain U15 (2000), Spain U16 (2001), Spain U17 (2001), Spain U18 (2001), Spain U19 (2002), Spain U21 (2002\u20132003), Spain (since 2003)\n\n     Fernando Jose Torres Sanz, more commonly known as just Fernando Torres, was born in Madrid, Spain, on 20 March 1984. He currently plays in the Premiership for Liverpool Football Club and is viewed as one of the best strikers in the world. Fernando has been successful throughout his career, from his time in Spain with Atletico Madrid to his time at Liverpool and at international level with Spain.\n     Like many young boys, Torres developed a keen interest to the beautiful game from a young age. His grandfather was a keen Atletico Madrid supporter and his brother played at an amateur level as a goalkeeper. Initially, Fernando Torres wanted to emulate the bit of success his brother had in that position. However, as with many players they find out their best position a few years into playing. Despite starting off as a goalkeeper, Torres developed an eye for goal and after scoring 55 goals for academy club Rayo 13, he soon realized that his best position was upfront.\n     In 1995, Spanish club Atletico Madrid trailed three of Rayo 13's star players, with Fernando being one of them. He impressed at his trial, and they decided to sign the young striker at the age of eleven.\n     Fernando Torres continued to make great progress through the ranks at the club during his teenage years, and his first chance to impress on a global scale came when Atletico Madrid decided to enter a team in the U15 Nike Cup. They won the tournament, with Torres voted the best player. Many were starting to see the potential in him, and his prospect excited many fans of the   Spanish club. At 15, he signed a professional contract with the club, and made his first team debut at the age of 17 against Leganes. Atletico were then promoted back to La Liga in 2001-02 season. Eventually, he went on to become club captain and scored 84 goals from 214 appearances for the team he had been with for many years. Despite this emotional attachment, when Liverpool came in with an offer of around \u00a320 Million, he decided to leave the club for England in 2007.\n     Torres had the opportunity to showcase his skills in the Premiership and for Liverpool. With the high transfer fee, many thought he may not respond well to the pressure being placed on him by the football world. This, however, was not the case.\n     The striker settled quickly at Liverpool, and immediately started to score goals on a regular basis. His first hat-trick was scored in September against Reading. He went on to score 33 goals in total, and since has become a respected figure in the Liverpool team and has scored 9 goals in all competitions so far in the 2008\/09 season.\n     Fernando Torres has also impressed at an international level for Spain and is known for scoring the winning goal against Germany in the Euro 2008 final. He continues to impress for both club and country and is recognized as one of the best strikers in the game.","birthday":"03\/20\/1984","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"!WARNING!\nPage \"Fernando Torres 9\" hasn't any contact with official sources or Fernando.

I learned how to work hard from my father who I always helped out in his auto body shop. I worked with him and realized that this is not the life that I wanted for myself. As a child watching Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movies, made me be fascinated with the idea of becoming a bodybuilder. \nAt 14 years old I was introduced to \u201cthe gym\u201d, which I made in my attic above the garage. At age 18, I started going to a real gym, which now I would call \u201cmy home\u201d. At age 19, I entered my first bodybuilding contest, the Lithuanian Championships in which I took 5th place. From there on out, I knew that this was something I wanted to do.\nI was always a strong guy, so I also decided to compete in power lifting. At the age of twenty I entered a bench press contest, in which I benched 405 lbs. \n\nWhen I turned 21 I had the opportunity to come to the States and I took it. I came to Connecticut, where I continued to work out. I took a brake from competing, so I could build a better physique. \n\nIn 2005, I started to compete in Strongman competitions in New England. Things were going well, however in end of 2006 I decided this is not want I want to do, and I went back to bodybuilding, my true passion. In my first shows I got qualified for the nationals. However, I could not go compete on a national level because I was not a US citizen. I lived in Connecticut until November 2008, and then my wife and I moved to Las Vegas, NV, where we currently live. \n\nThe USA Bodybuilding Championships in 2008 was my first time on a national level stage, were I finished 7th from 28 guys in the super heavy weight division. In 5 weeks I decided to do the North Americans in Ohio and I placed 6th. Competing in these shows was a good experience. In 2009, I came back to the USA\u2019s and placed 3rd. The same year at the NPC Nationals was runner up. Finally in October 2010 I achieved my goal in bodybuilding: became IFBB PRO. \n\nLegs: 3Effects training has had on your life: Made me more confident and disciplined.\nWhat do you like most about competing: Getting on stage and entertaining people.\nPhysique you admire: Jay Cutler\nYour best body part: Arms\nFavorite Food: Steak (medium rare) with baked potato.\nFavorite exercises: Bench press \nLong term goal: To be a top competitor at the Olympia\n","birthday":"07\/08\/1978","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"www.robertburneika.net\nhttp:\/\/burneikasports.com\/pl\/","talking_about_count":15367,"username":"robertburneika","website":"www.robertburneika.net www.burneikasports.com www.hardkorowykoksu.pl","were_here_count":0,"id":"187941397895831","name":"Official Robert Burneika","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/robertburneika","likes":387933,"cover":{"cover_id":645718402118126,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1426731_645718402118126_2135729672_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":40}}

He is an outstanding allrounder, capable of batting anywhere in the top order and also delivers lively medium pace. A fixture in the youth side since his debut, he was handed the captaincy for the 2005 tour of England. The hightlight on that tour was an, unbeaten 123 in the third Test which, although it was not enough to stave of defeat. During the U-19 triangular series involving Bangladesh and England towards the end of 2005, Mathews produced a series impressive, mature innings with the bat. \n\nAn unbeaten 70 set up a win against England and he followed that with 97 not out, in a defeat, against Bangladesh. After a quiet debut first-class season, in 2007-08, he made big strides with 696 runs at 58 and carried his good form in to Sri Lanka A's tour of South Africa. His performances there won the praise of the coach, Chandika Hathurusingha, who identified him as one for the future. He made it to the national side for the tour of Zimbabwe in 2008.\n\nPlease note that the Angelo Mathews Fanpage on facebook is operated by fellow fans of the cricketer and not by Angelo himself.

{"about":"Name:Frank Lampard\nNationality:English\nDate of Birth:20\/06\/1978\nHeight:184 cmWeight:88.0 kg\nPrevious Clubs: Swansea, West Ham\n Position:Midfielde","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"League title winning-goals, FA Cup and Champions League Final strikes, nerveless penalty taking, assists galore and record-breaking sequences of appearances, Frank Lampard has been both the man for the big occasion, and for the week-in, week-out dedication that is the bedrock of genuine achievement. He is without doubt one of the finest players ever to wear the Chelsea blue.\nAfter a quiet start at the Bridge, with just 15 goals in two years following an \u00a311 million transfer from West Ham, Frank bloomed into one of Europe's finest.\nAn early sign of what was to come was his commanding display against Arsenal's Patrick Vieira in an FA Cup Final defeat at the end of his first season, progress that was continued the following campaign.\nIn 2003\/04, the first season under Roman Abramovich's ownership and Frank's third at the club, he retained his place despite many new arrivals and his phenomenal form was only beaten by Thierry Henry when English football's individual awards were handed out.\nThe top performances continued to come in 2004\/05, as did the goals, Frank's powerful shooting firing Chelsea to the Premiership title that season as he top-scored from midfield with 13 in the League and 19 overall. There was no one more appropriate to score the two magical goals at Bolton that sealed the championship triumph.\nThe Sportswriters' Footballer of the Year that year and runner-up in the European and World Player of the Year voting for 2005, Frank continued to prove as close to indispensable as can be found in modern football as his team duplicated the Premiership success in 2005\/06.\nWhen in December 2005, he finally missed a game due to a virus infection, it brought to an end a new Premier League record of 164 consecutive appearances, since surpassed by goalkeeper Brad Friedel.\nIn 2006\/07, his 62 games was the highest total by any Chelsea player in a single campaign and although the next year was affected by two rare injuries and bereavement, Frank continued to drive Chelsea on from midfield game after game after game and made it to the now regular 20-goal mark.\nThe injuries were unfortunate but genuine tragedy struck in April 2008 with the death of Frank's mother. His courage and nerve in scoring a vital Champions League semi-final penalty against Liverpool on his return from compassionate leave, followed by his dramatic equaliser in the Final, were among that season's strongest images.\nSince then Lamps has become Chelsea's top scoring midfield player ever; and is the player to win the most international caps while a Chelsea player.\nA five-year deal was signed in the summer of 2008, and he quickly got into goalscoring form, netting an audacious chip from the edge of the area at Hull in October that year, an automatic Chelsea Goal of the Season contender though eventually edged out by Michael Essien's Champions League volley against Barcelona.\nAs the performances of those around him began to wane, Frank's form remained consistent under Luiz Felipe Scolari, scoring key goals over Christmas 2008 to keep the team in touch with the league leaders.\nThe arrival of Guus Hiddink midway through the campaign brought extended freedom for Lampard, who repaid his coach with late goals in a league win over Wigan and a 4-4 Champions League thriller against Liverpool, before we eventually bowed out of Europe in controversial circumstances against Barcelona. There was however joy when his second-half strike won the 2009 FA Cup against Everton, his goal celebration a nod to that of his father's in an FA Cup semi-final 29 years earlier.\nWith an incredible 27 goals from central midfield in 2009\/10 and a sack-full of assists as Chelsea won the Double, it seemed Frank was improving with age, especially factoring in his resistance to injury and his ability to avoid a single yellow card in the whole of that season.\nHis historic '09\/'10 season began as it would end - at Wembley - where he contributed a Community Shield goal, helped set up another, and then buried a penalty in the successful shootout.\nThe 31-year-old actually went 10 games without a goal before four in three arrived in October.\nAfter a penalty miss at Man City at the beginning of a difficult Christmas period, it was two successful penalties that dug the team out of trouble against Portsmouth and West Ham.\nHe bounced back from Champions League disappointment against Inter Milan in the first knockout round by banging in four league goals against Aston Villa in a 7-1 rout.\nThe feat, the second time he had achieved such a tally in a game, took him over the 150-goal mark for Chelsea and beyond Roy Bentley to become our third-highest scorer of all time.\nAfter converting another penalty against Villa at Wembley to book a place in the FA Cup Final, the focus shifted to league football for the next five games, and it was there where Frank really delivered.\nAt Anfield there were major celebrations as he swept home Nicolas Anelka's centre to confirm crucial victory in the run-in.\nIn the final league game Frank won and took a penalty to put Carlo Ancelotti's team two goals to the good as we ran riot against Wigan, setting up the Double should we beat Portsmouth in the FA Cup Final.\nIt was a Drogba free-kick that broke the deadlock that Wembley May day, and even though Frank's final contribution was to drag a penalty wide at the death, he was there in the Royal Box to lift the trophy alongside John Terry.\nThe 2010\/11 season was a rare one in the Lampard collection in that it was afflicted with lengthy injury. Recovering from a routine hernia op, he suffered a tendon injury at the top of his leg in training which lengthened the absence to four months during which team form declined.\nHe scored his second goal of the season in the first game of 2011 and still collected 13 goals by the end. On April 6th in a home Champions League game against Manchester United, he become only the fourth player to make 500 appearances for Chelsea.\nThe 2011\/12 season featured the sideshow of Lampard slowly but surely edging towards Bobby Tambling's all-time club goalscoring record. It was a vintage Lampard performance at the Reebok, a very happy hunting ground for him and Chelsea, in early October as the midfielder hit a hat-trick. He hit three goals on the spin at the start of 2012 and netted a crucial late penalty against Napoli to level the tie on aggregate, his 14th of the season.\nAs the season drew to a close, Lampard's ability and experience, as so often in the past, rose to the fore. He scored a sublime free-kick in the 5-1 FA Cup semi-final win against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley, as well as teeing up Didier Drogba for what proved to be the winning goal in the Final of the same competition.\nHe finished the season by skippering the side for the Champions League Final in Munich in John Terry's absence, and capped a wonderful display by lifting the trophy alongside the suspended captain after scoring our third penalty in the shoot-out.\nLampard began the current season is typical fashion, scoring our second goal from the penalty spot in the opening-day 2-0 win away at Wigan Athletic, before doing the same three days later against Reading at Stamford Bridge.\nHis first goal of the season from open play came during the 4-1 win against Norwich City when he fired us into a 2-1 lead from the edge of the penalty area, his 189th goal for the club.\nLampard missed a sustained period of the current campaign after picking up a calf injury during our Champions League defeat in Shakhtar Donetsk, before making his return during the 3-1 win at Sunderland in December. After coming on as a substitute in our Club World Cup semi-final against Monterrey, he returned to captain the side for the final defeat against Corinthians.\nIn his 500th Premier League appearance he scored in the 8-0 win against Aston Villa, while his brace in the following game against Everton helped us to a 2-1 win, taking his Chelsea goal tally to 192, just one behind Kerry Dixon in our all-time goalscorers list.\nLampard became the joint-second highest goalscorer in the club's history when he scored from the penalty spot in our 5-1 FA Cup win at Southampton, equalling Dixon's tally of 193. The goal also saw him become our joint-highest scorer in FA Cup history, drawing level with Bobby Tambling on 25.\nA week later, he went ahead of Dixon in the club's goalscoring charts when he scored our third in a 4-0 win at Stoke City. Goals against Arsenal, Reading, Newcastle United and Brentford followed, taking Lampard to within two goals of Tambling's record. \nLampard scored his 200th Chelsea goal in a 2-0 win against former club West Ham United in March, 2013, heading home from Eden Hazard's cross to take him to within two goals of Bobby Tambling's record, while a 44th-minute penalty in the home win against Swansea - scored in front of the watching Tambling - took him to the 201-mark.\nIn the away game at Aston Villa in May Lampard finally surpassed Tambling, winning us the match in the process. Trailing to Christian Benteke's opener, Lampard equalled the club record with Chelsea goal 202, collecting the ball inside the penalty area and firing beyond Brad Guzan.\nBetter was to come in the dying moments of the match when the Blues midfielder made history. Eden Hazard and Ashley Cole exchanged passes inside the box, and the Belgian crossed for Lampard - who had timed his run to perfection in trademark fashion - to finish and become the club's all-time highest scorer.\nPre-Chelsea\nIronically, Frank's ever-present habit was one of the reasons why he was under-appreciated by some at the club that nurtured him.\nWith Frank's father the West Ham first team coach when the teenager broke into the first team there, sections of the support at Upton Park cried nepotism over the son's regular place in their side. He was ever-present in the Hammers team that finished fifth in '98\/'99 and was capped for England the next season.\nHowever when manager Harry Redknapp and Frank senior were sacked in 2001, it was time for Frank to move on and although Leeds was a possible destination at the time, it was across London the player went as he sought a club where he could take his career to the next level.\n\nInternational goal\nAfter a debut against Belgium in 1999, Frank would have to wait until June 2003 to feature for a full 90 minutes in an England shirt, and he scored his first goal that August against Croatia.\nHe was well worth his place in the Euro 2004 team and was voted the England team's Player of the Year after three goals in four tournament games, and he won the poll again in 2005.\nThat made it all the more surprising when Frank failed to register on the score sheet in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, despite shooting more frequently than anyone.\nIt drew outside criticism, his years of incredibly consistent achievement seemingly forgotten, but after a lean spell under Steve McClaren he returned to goalscoring form under Fabio Capello, and Frank's critics began to re-evaluate their opinions and he was finally being appreciated in an England shirt too.\nUnlike in 2006, Frank went into the 2010 World Cup in red-hot scoring form, even by his own extraordinary standards.\nHowever as Capello played with the jigsaw of England's midfield, Frank's goal threat again appeared diminished although he was one of the best players against Slovenia in the third group game, and was infamously denied his first World Cup goal by a ludicrous linesman's decision as England exited versus Germany.\nA hernia operation meant he sat out the beginning of England's Euro 2012 qualifying campaign but he returned in 2011 with goals and victories with the three lions on his chest. No Chelsea player has won more international caps while playing for the club.\nFrank took the captain's armband for England's friendly against Spain in November, scoring the only goal of the game.\nSadly for him, however, after being named in Roy Hodgson's final squad for the tournament, he picked up a hamstring injury shortly after joining up with his teammates and was ruled out of the tournament.\nHowever, in the first friendly following the tournament - against Italy in Berne - Lampard was once again named captain, playing a pivotal role as England came from behind to win 2-1.\nHe was then named in the squad ahead of the World Cup qualifiiers against Moldova and Ukraine, subsequently scoring three times over the course of the two games.\nLampard was named in the squad for the games against San Marino and Poland in October 2012, but was forced to pull out due to a calf injury.\nIn February 2013, he came off the bench to score the winner as England beat Brazil 2-1 at Wembley in a friendly.scoring every time he visits, including May's FA Cup winner against Everton, struck from 25 yards on his weaker left foot, the perfect way to sign off for the summer.\nOnce again it was a campaign in which the midfielder scored consistently, adding another 20 in Chelsea colours to make it 100 over the last five seasons.\nHe quickly got into goalscoring form, netting twice in September before two more followed in October, the latter being an audacious chip from the edge of the area at Hull, an automatic Goal of the Season contender, though eventually edged out by Michael Essien's volley against Barcelona.\nAs the performances of those around him began to wane, Frank's form remained consistent under Luiz Felipe Scolari, scoring key goals over Christmas against West Brom and Fulham to keep us in touch with the league leaders.\nAn overturned red card at Liverpool in February earned rare sympathy from outside Stamford Bridge, and the arrival of Guus Hiddink brought extended freedom for the former West Ham man, who repaid his coach with vital goals in a late win over Wigan and a 4-4 Champions League thriller against Liverpool, before we eventually bowed out in controversial circumstances against Barcelona.\nMonths before committing to a new five-year deal in the summer of 2008, Frank had scored a dramatic equaliser in the Champions League Final in Moscow, while also converting a penalty in the shootout.\nIt remains the one club medal that has eluded him since eyebrows were raised over an original \u00a311 million transfer fee paid eight years ago.\nSince then Lamps has become Chelsea's top scoring midfield player ever; is the club's fifth highest scorer of all-time and is only the second player to win 50 international caps while a Chelsea player.\nIn 2006\/07, his 62 games was the highest total by any Chelsea player in a single campaign and although the next year was affected by two rare injuries and bereavement, Frank continued to drive Chelsea on from midfield game after game after game.\nWhen in December 2005, he finally missed a game due to a virus, it brought to an end a new Premier League record of 164 consecutive appearances.\nIronically, Frank's ever-present habit was one of the reasons why he was under-appreciated by some at the club that nurtured him.\nWith Frank's father the West Ham first team coach, sections of the support at Upton Park cried nepotism over the young player's regular place in their side. He was ever-present in the Hammers team that finished fifth in '98\/'99 and was capped for England the next season.\nWhen manager Harry Redknapp and Frank senior were sacked from Upton Park, it was time for our Frank to move on.\nAfter a quiet start at the Bridge, he bloomed into one of Europe's finest and in 2003\/04, Frank's phenomenal form was only beaten by Thierry Henry when English football's individual awards were handed out.\nHe was well worth his place in the Euro 2004 team and was voted the England team's Player of the Year.\nThe top performances continued to come, as did the goals, Frank's powerful shooting firing Chelsea to the 2004\/05 Championship as he top-scored from midfield with 13 in the League and 19 overall - there was no one more appropriate to score those magical goals at Bolton.\nThe Sportswriters' Footballer of the Year that year (only the second Chelsea winner in over 50 years) and runner-up in the European and World Player of the Year voting for 2005, Frank continued to prove as close to indispensable as can be found in modern squad-based football as his team duplicated the Premiership success in 2005\/06.\nAgain the vice-captain was top scorer, this time with 20 goals. His 16 in the League was the highest total ever by a Premiership midfielder.\nThat made it all the more surprising when Frank failed to register on the score sheet in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, despite shooting more frequently than anyone. \nIt drew outside criticism, his years of incredibly consistent achievement seemingly forgotten overnight.\nHe needed prove himself to nobody at Chelsea, and Frank also continued to create goals at a rate unrivalled at Chelsea, leading former boss Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to simply describe him as unique.\nIn 2007\/08, having missed September with a thigh injury, his return to the side in early October coincided with a gradual climb up the league table. He contributed 11 goals before his other thigh was strained on Boxing Day. Another six weeks were missed.\nThat was unfortunate but genuine tragedy struck in April with the death of Frank's mother. His courage and nerve in scoring a vital Champions League semi-final penalty against Liverpool on his return from compassionate leave, followed by his Moscow goal, were among that season's strongest images.\nEven Frank's harshest critics began to re-evaluate their opinions, and now at the age of 31 he is finally being appreciated in an England shirt too, playing a slightly deeper role to accommodate the Steven Gerrard \/ Wayne Rooney axis.","talking_about_count":1202,"were_here_count":0,"id":"355467498160","name":"Frank Lampard","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Frank-Lampard\/355467498160","likes":137955,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151449909623161","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/310098_10151449909623161_504855212_n.jpg","offset_y":71,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"tweet me www.twitter.com\/dominiquedawes","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"ABOUT DOMINIQUE DAWES, THE ONLY AFRICAN AMERICAN GYMNAST TO WIN A GOLD MEDAL.\n\nFrom Olympic Gold Medalist to Broadway to television analyst to President of the Women\u2019s Sports Foundation to Yahoo! Sports Olympics analyst Dominique Dawes continues on a path to inspire, motivate and lead.\n\nDominique Dawes is best known for her tremendous success as an Olympic gymnast who competed in three Olympic Games, won three medals and has a permanent place in the U.S. Olympic Committee Hall of Fame. Fans across the nation and around the world remember her as a member of the gold-medal-winning \"Magnificent Seven\" at the 1996 Atlanta Games, where she also won a bronze medal as she wowed the crowed with her stunning performance in the floor exercise, becoming the first female African-American gymnast to win an individual medal. She also earned a bronze medal with the U.S. team in the 1992 Barcelona Games and made a surprising comeback in the 2000 Sydney Games.\nDawes\u2019 start in gymnastics began at the age of 6. Her first and only coach, Kelli Hill quickly realized her potential, and Dawes began competing at the age of 10. She burst into the international spotlight at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, where she was the first African-American female to qualify to an Olympic Games through the Olympic trials in Baltimore, MD. At these Games, she and her teammates captured a bronze medal.\nFans will recall that she was the gymnast that wowed the audience with her unique \u2018up-and-back\u2019 tumbling pass that consisted of 11 skills, spanning from one end of the floor to the other.\n\"I could never hear my floor music after that tumbling pass,\u201d Dawes recalled. \u201cThe crowd would be cheering so loud; I would just have to dance to their cheers. It was an amazing feeling.\u201d\nThroughout her career, Dawes has won more National Championship medals than any other athlete, male or female, since 1963, as well as numerous World Championship medals. One of Dawes\u2019 greatest feats came when she swept all four events and won the All Around title at the 1994 National Championships.\n\"Winning my first national title was exciting,\u201d Dawes said. \u201cI was struggling for over a month each and every day of practice leading up to the Nationals. I couldn\u2019t stay on the balance beam to save my life. My consistency and confidence were failing. I am not sure if it was the pressure of the sport getting to me, but whatever it was, it made it difficult to stay focused on my goals. One day after practice, Mrs. Norman, a parent of a teammate, took me aside and said the kindest words to me. She didn\u2019t add pressure or give me advice about training; she showed me compassion. To this day, her words still resonate in my head and inspire me to stay focused whenever times get tough. At that moment I learned that saying the right words, at the right time, can lift someone\u2019s spirit. Words are powerful so today I aspire to offer those same kind words to those that I come in contact with.\"\nDawes is much more than a champion gymnast, though. After retiring from the sport to which she dedicated 18 years of her life, Dawes has found a new passion empowering others. She is an accomplished motivational speaker, speaking to audiences of hundreds and thousands on topics focusing on passion, leadership, teamwork, health, fitness and wellness. Dawes\u2019 message empowers vast audiences, from corporate executives to small business owners, women\u2019s organizations to youth service organizations, and high school to college-age students; her passion and energy is captivating and leaves a lasting effect on those she inspires.\n\nSince Dawes\u2019 first passion in life was gymnastics, she continues to educate those on the grassroots level. She hosts gymnastics clinics for aspiring athletes of all ages, with a focus on fundamentals, goal-setting, and mental toughness. She has served as a spokesperson for multiple local and national campaigns dealing with causes to build the self-esteem of today\u2019s youth and women. Dawes stays involved in high-level competitive gymnastics by working as an analyst in the media, traveling to China in 2008 to report on the Beijing Olympics for Yahoo!

{"about":"The official Facebook page for WWE Diva Kaitlyn","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"When Kaitlyn told the WWE NXT audience she was the kind of gal who\u2019d kiss you behind the bleachers and then give you a wedgie, she wasn\u2019t kidding.\n\nPrior to her debut in WWE, the beautiful and spunky Diva spent years in competitive fitness and bodybuilding, resulting in a strong sense of confidence that she brings with her every time she steps into the squared circle. Of course, the guidance of her WWE Pro Vickie Guerrero didn\u2019t hurt Kaitlyn\u2019s odds in season three of WWE NXT, in which she rose above the pack to win the only all-female competition.\n\nKaitlyn\u2019s now lighting up cameras and busting up Divas on SmackDown, where she previously aligned with her \u201cbestie\u201d AJ. As \u201cThe Chickbusters,\u201d the two gal pals sought to cut a swath through the SmackDown Divas division and enjoy the ride of a lifetime together. Although their friendship became fractured with AJ\u2019s recent unstable outbursts, Kaitlyn focused on her goal of becoming Divas Champion. She made it one step closer after winning a Battle Royal on Raw to become the No. 1 contender.\n\nPrior to her Divas Championship bout with Layla at Night of Champions, however, Kaitlyn was attacked in the locker room area by a mystery blonde assailant and was rendered unable to compete that night. As Kaitlyn was being tended to by WWE medical personnel, SmackDown General Manager Booker T\u2019s assistant Eve informed the injured Diva that her title opportunity would be postponed to a later date.\n\nOn the Nov. 13 edition of Raw, Kaitlyn scored a huge win over Layla in a No. 1 Contender\u2019s Match and went on to challenge Eve at Survivor Series. After warding off another attack from an anonymous blonde in the backstage area \u2014 who turned out to be Aksana in a wig \u2014 Kaitlyn fell short in dethroning her rival.\n\nThen, on the 20th anniversary of Raw, Kaitlyn finally dethroned Eve with a hard-hitting spear to capture the Divas Championship in her hometown of Houston. The following month at Elimination Chamber, Kaitlyn successfully defended her title for the first time on pay-per-view against the intimidating Tamina.\n\nNow, Kaitlyn awaits when she will defend her title against AJ Lee, who won a No. 1 Contender's Diva Battle Royal on the April 22 edition of Raw.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Houston","state":"TX","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":1249,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"152486934780020","name":"Kaitlyn - WWE","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Kaitlyn-WWE\/152486934780020","likes":265426,"cover":{"cover_id":430857413609636,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/546188_430857413609636_273104131_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Va sortir en l'onze inicial i va marcar un gol; el millor debut que es podia imaginar. Xavi tamb\u00e9 va tenir una important participaci\u00f3 en la consecuci\u00f3 de la Lliga 1998-99, amb Van Gaal a la banqueta, amb un gol al Nuevo Zorrilla que va engegar la reacci\u00f3 de l'equip.\nLa temporada 1999-2000 va ser molt bona per a Xavi perqu\u00e8, a causa de la llarga lesi\u00f3 de Guardiola, va ser el '4' titular durant bona part de la campanya. Despr\u00e9s de la marxa del llavors capit\u00e0 al futbol itali\u00e0, es va convertir en l'organitzador del joc blaugrana.\nTant amb Van Gaal, com amb Rexach, Antic, Rijkaard o Guardiola a la banqueta, Xavi ha estat sempre un dels pilars del Bar\u00e7a. Prova del seu paper decisiu en el joc del Bar\u00e7a en les darreres temporades \u00e9s que amb 25 anys, Xavi ja va arribar a la xifra de 300 partits oficials com a blaugrana.\nAmb l'arribada de Rijkaard, el jugador de Terrassa va anar combinant la seva posici\u00f3 en el mig del camp i va ocupar amb la mateixa solv\u00e8ncia qualsevol dels llocs de la medul\u00b7lar. Per aix\u00f2 va ser un dels jugadors m\u00e9s utilitzats pel t\u00e8cnic per aconseguir la Lliga 2004-05 ja que va participar en 36 partits.\nXavi sempre recordar\u00e0 el 2 de desembre de 2005. En un entrenament a la Masia, el migcampista de Terrassa va fer un mal gest al genoll dret i es va trencar els lligaments creuats. Es va recuperar abans del que estava previst i en cinc mesos va tornar a jugar. El 29 d\u2019abril del 2006 contra el C\u00e0dis, Xavi ja va tornar a jugar i va arribar a temps per celebrar la Lliga i la Lliga de Campions amb l\u2019equip.\n\nEn les dues \u00faltimes temporades amb Frank Rijkaard a la banqueta, Xavi va seguir acumulant una gran quantitat de partits i va ser un dels jugadors m\u00e9s utilitzats pel t\u00e8cnic holand\u00e8s. En la 2007-08, a m\u00e9s, va assolir un record individual golejador i va marcar 7 gols a la Lliga, molt per sobre la de seva millor marca fins llavors que havien estat els 4 que havia marcat en les temporades 2001-02 i 2003-04.\n\nEn el primer any de Guardiola Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez continua eixamplant les seves xifres golejadores. Bat el seus propis r\u00e8cords i anota fins a 10 gols en 54 partits, una nova fita per a ell. Juntament amb Iniesta, \u00e9s el motor que fa anar l\u2019equip. Sense ell, no s\u2019ent\u00e9n el Bar\u00e7a del triplet. Ni el posterior Bar\u00e7a de les Sis Copes. Xavi lidera el conjunt que es proclama campi\u00f3 de Lliga 2009\/10 amb uns hist\u00f2rics 99 punts.\n\nA m\u00e9s, en tot aquest temps, Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez tamb\u00e9 ha estat un dels indiscutibles de la selecci\u00f3 espanyola i ja ha participat en tres Mundials (2002, 2006 i 2010) i en dues edicions de l\u2019Eurocopa (2004 i 2008), sent en aquesta \u00faltima considerat com el millor jugador de la competici\u00f3 despr\u00e9s d'aixecar el t\u00edtol amb Espanya. En aquest sentit, el jugador de Terrassa va ser reconegut en els premis FIFA WORLD PLAYER de l'any 2008, en el que va acabar cinqu\u00e8.\n\nEl Mundial del 2010 que va guanyar amb Espanya a Sud-\u00e0frica completa un palmar\u00e8s de luxe. Xavi va ser l\u2019indiscutible cervell de la selecci\u00f3 espanyola i es va erigir en el millor passador de la competici\u00f3.\n\nDes de la temporada 2010\/11, el migcampista ostenta un r\u00e8cord individual que creix dia rere dia: \u00e9s el jugador que m\u00e9s partits oficials ha jugat amb la samarreta del Bar\u00e7a. El 2 de gener del 2011, en el partit de Lliga davant el Llevant (2-1), Xavi va igualar Migueli, que fins aleshores era el propietari del r\u00e8cord amb 549 partits disputats amb el club blaugrana.\n\nPERFIL\nXavi dirigeix l'equip en cada partit sense nervis i amb molta sobrietat. Des que ocupa la posici\u00f3 d'organitzador del Bar\u00e7a, ha demostrat tenir una excel\u00b7lent visi\u00f3 de la jugada. \u00c9s un exemple m\u00e9s de la bona tasca desenvolupada pels equips inferiors blaugrana, especialment pel que es refereix a la posici\u00f3 de '4'.\nAmb els anys, a m\u00e9s, ha sabut adaptar-se i ha demostrat la mateixa qualitat jugant en les diferents posicions del mig del camp. Les seves passades llargues en profunditat i la seva facilitat per a treure's la pressi\u00f3 del damunt l'han convertit en el referent del centre del camp.\nSap protegir la pilota com pocs i aix\u00f2 fa que sigui complicat que en perdi alguna. A m\u00e9s, destaca per les seves tasques defensives i de recuperaci\u00f3 de pilota. El seu xut potent i col\u00b7locat i la seva arribada a l'\u00e0rea tamb\u00e9 l'han perm\u00e8s fer alguns gols tant en jugada com en llan\u00e7aments directes de falta.","birthday":"01\/25\/1980","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Barcelona","state":"","country":"Spain","zip":""},"personal_info":"Benvinguts amics de la p\u00e0gina # 1 de Xavier Hern\u00e1ndez Creus fans de tot el m\u00f3n!

He became the most expensive footballer in history after moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid in a transfer worth \u00a380 million (\u20ac94 million\/$131.6 million), a record that would later be broken by Gareth Bale, who joined Real Madrid in 2013 for \u00a385 million (\u20ac100 million).In addition, Ronaldo's contract with Real Madrid, under the terms of which he is paid \u20ac12 million per year, makes him one of the highest-paid footballers in the world, and his buyout clause is valued at \u20ac1 billion as per his contract.\nRonaldo began his career as a youth player for Andorinha, where he played for two years, before moving to C.D. Nacional. In 1997, he made a move to Portuguese giants Sporting Clube de Portugal. Ronaldo caught the attention of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who signed him for \u00a312.24 million (\u20ac15 million) in 2003. The following season, Ronaldo won his first club honour, the FA Cup.\nRonaldo was the first player playing in England to win all four main PFA and FWA awards, doing so in 2007. In 2008, Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or. He placed second in the Ballon d'Or in 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2012. He was awarded the European Golden Shoe in both 2008 and 2011. In 2008, he won three of the four main PFA and FWA trophies and was named the FIFPro Player of the Year, World Soccer Player of the Year, Onze d'Or, and the FIFA World Player of the Year. In 2007 and 2008, Ronaldo was named FWA Footballer of the Year. Ronaldo was the inaugural winner of the FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award for the Goal of the Year in 2009.\nRonaldo is considered as one of the best footballers in the world. He holds numerous former and current scoring records, including records for most goals scored in a season for Real Madrid, most goals scored per minute in La Liga, first top European league player to reach 40 goals in a single season in two consecutive years, fastest Real Madrid player to reach one hundred league goals, and the first player ever to score against every team in a single season in La LigaIn January 2013, Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 300th club goal.\nRonaldo is a Portuguese international and made his debut against Kazakhstan in August 2003. He has since participated in five major tournaments; UEFA Euro 2004, the 2006 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2008, the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012. He scored his first international goal in the opening game of the Euro 2004 against Greece, in addition to helping Portugal reach the final. He took over the captaincy of the side in July 2008 and went on to captain Portugal to the semi-finals at the Euro 2012 and finished the competition as the joint best scorer with three goals. On 16 October 2012, Ronaldo won his 100th cap against Northern Ireland, making him the third highest capped player for Portugal and became the third youngest European to reach a century of international appearances.","birthday":"02\/05\/1986","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"Madrid, Spain","city":"Madrid","state":"","country":"Spain","zip":""},"talking_about_count":3319,"username":"CR7.Balkan.fans","were_here_count":0,"id":"140937665942419","name":"CR7","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CR7.Balkan.fans","likes":463846,"cover":{"cover_id":571354619567386,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1185520_571354619567386_1805426886_n.jpg","offset_y":64,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"La fan page ufficiale di Mario Balotelli","awards":"-Champions league\n-Scudetto\n-Coppa italia\n-Supercoppa italia","bio":"Mario nasce a Palermo il 12 Agosto 1990, ma dall\u2019et\u00e0 di quasi 2 anni vive a Brescia nella sua nuova famiglia italiana, i Balotelli.\nDa subito mamma, pap\u00e0 e i fratelli Corrado, Giovanni e Cristina di molti anni maggiori di lui, si prendono cura del piccolo Mario offrendogli tutto l\u2019amore che si d\u00e0 ad un figlio o a un fratello.\n\tI primi passi \nGi\u00e0 a cinque anni Mario vuole giocare a calcio e inizia a vestire la maglia nella societ\u00e0 dell\u2019oratorio parrocchiale di Mompiano (Brescia). Subito viene aggregato ai ragazzini pi\u00f9 grandi grazie alle eccezionali doti tecniche. Nel 2001 approda all\u2019A.C. Lumezzane e a 15 anni esordisce nella prima squadra, il 2 Aprile 2006 (Padova-Lumezzane, Stadio Euganeo). Cos\u00ec, anche grazie a una deroga speciale concessa dalla Lega di C (per giocare tra i professionisti occorre aver compiuto 16 anni), Mario \u00e8 il pi\u00f9 giovane esordiente nella storia della categoria.\n\tL\u2019Inter\nNell\u2019estate del 2006, Mario fa un provino di 5 giorni al Camp Nou di Barcellona, segna 8 gol e vive emozioni indimenticabili. I fratelli, partner di una societ\u00e0 di consulenza per il commercio estero, s\u2019incaricano di trovargli la squadra ideale e iniziano una serie di trattative. Ma c\u2019\u00e8 il problema della cittadinanza: nonostante sia nato in Italia, Mario deve attendere la maggiore et\u00e0 per ottenerla. Cos\u00ec saltano le trattative con il Bar\u00e7a. Il 31 agosto arriva l\u2019F.C. Internazionale, il progetto piace e Mario entra a far parte degli Allievi Nazionali del club. Segna gol a raffica e viene promosso alla categoria Primavera: 8 gol in 11 partite e lo Scudetto di Bressanone. Con la Primavera, oltre allo Scudetto 2006-07, Mario vince il Torneo di Viareggio 2008.\n\tEsordio in A \nA 17 anni l\u2019esordio in prima squadra con l\u2019allenatore Roberto Mancini nel finale della partita di campionato Cagliari-Inter (17 dicembre 2007). Poco dopo, gioca titolare in Coppa Italia e firma una doppietta (19 dicembre, Reggina-Inter 1-4). Ma \u00e8 nel gennaio 2008 che Mario si fa conoscere da tutti, con una strepitosa doppietta alla Juventus in Coppa Italia. I media parlano di lui come di un \u201cfenomeno\u201d. Questi 4 gol gli permettono di diventare Capocannoniere Coppa Italia 2007-2008 (con Cruz e Iaquinta). In Atalanta-Inter (0-2), aprile 2008, Mario segna il primo gol in Serie A e contribuisce allo scudetto segnando ancora contro Fiorentina e Siena.\n\tCittadinanza Italiana\nCompiuti i 18 anni, Mario finalmente ottiene la cittadinanza italiana (13 agosto 2008). La legge non contemplava un caso come il suo e Mario non fa in tempo a partecipare alle Olimpiadi di Pechino. La cerimonia si svolge nel Comune di Concesio, alla presenza del Sindaco Diego Peli, dei famigliari, di amici e di molti giornalisti. \u201cRingrazio la mia famiglia, che mi \u00e8 stata vicino anche in questa lunga pratica, e tutti voi. Sono felice di essere un cittadino italiano\u201d, esordisce Mario, che poi regala la sua maglia dell\u2019Inter al Sindaco e riceve una medaglia del Comune, simbolo d\u2019appartenenza alla comunit\u00e0 di Concesio.\n\tLa maglia azzurra\nNel settembre 2008 Mario esordisce in azzurro con l\u2019Under 21 allenata da Pierluigi Casiraghi, segnando subito un gol (Italia-Grecia).\nDue mesi dopo arriva il suo primo gol in Champions League (Anorthosis-Inter, 3-3, novembre 2008).\n\u00c8 il pi\u00f9 giovane marcatore in Champions League della storia dell\u2019Inter.\n\tVittorie in nerazzurro\nLa stagione 2008-2009 si apre con la Supercoppa italiana vinta contro la Roma dopo i calci di rigore (8-7). Mario segna il secondo gol dei nerazzurri e uno dei rigori. Il 1 marzo 2009 realizza la sua prima doppietta in Serie A, nella partita Inter-Roma (3-3). Ma cominciano gli insulti dei tifosi, culminati nei cori razzisti degli ultras della Juventus (aprile 2009). Ancora una volta, per\u00f2, Mario vince lo Scudetto con l\u2019Inter. In totale, sono tre i Campionati vinti in nerazzurro (2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2009-2010). Oltre a una Coppa Italia (2009-2010) e una Supercoppa italiana (2008), con i nerazzurri Mario vince anche la Champions League 2009-2010.\n\tDebutto in Nazionale\nNell\u2019agosto 2010, due giorni prima del suo ventesimo compleanno, Mario debutta a Londra con la Nazionale allenata da Cesare Prandelli. Per lui \u00e8 l\u2019emozione pi\u00f9 grande.\nAllo stadio del West Ham gli Azzurri perdono 1-0 con la Costa d\u2019Avorio, ma i giudizi sull\u2019esordio di Mario sono tutti positivi.\n\tLa nuova squadra: il Manchester City\nIn pochi giorni cambiano tante cose: dopo la Nazionale, il 13 agosto Mario vola a Manchester per firmare il contratto con il City, la sua nuova squadra, dove ritrova l\u2019allenatore Roberto Mancini e debutta con un gol importante.\nIn Europa League, nella partita contro il Timisoara, Mario firma la rete del vantaggio (0-1) dopo un quarto d\u2019ora dal suo ingresso sul terreno di gioco.","birthday":"08\/12\/1990","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Palermo","state":"","country":"Italy","zip":""},"talking_about_count":292,"username":"M45Balotelli","website":"http:\/\/www.mariobalotelli.it\/it\/home\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"303969982964774","name":"Mario Balotelli Barwuah (official)","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/M45Balotelli","likes":187863,"cover":{"cover_id":664350563593379,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/936473_664350563593379_1734634468_n.jpg","offset_y":90,"offset_x":0}}

At Bishop Gorman HS, Murray was considered one of the best running backs in the 2005 recruiting class.  After rushing for 1,947 yards, 27 touchdowns, and gaining a total of 2,571 yards from scrimmage in his senior year, DeMarco was honored as an All-American and was elected to the 2006 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.  It was at the All-American Bowl  where Murray chose the Oklahoma Sooners over the USC Trojans on live television.

In his first game against North Texas he ran for an OU single game record 5 touchdowns and an astounding 201 rushing yards.  DeMarco\u2019s continued success throughout his freshman campaign ended  with Murray be named a Freshman All-American as well as tying Adrian Peterson with OU\u2019s freshman record of 15 total touchdowns.

{"category":"Actor\/director","description":"Julius Winfield Erving II , commonly known by the nickname Dr.\u00a0J, is a retired American basketball player who helped launch a modern style of play that emphasizes leaping and play above the rim. Erving helped legitimize the American Basketball Association , and was the best-known player in that league when it merged with the National Basketball Association after the 1975\u201376 season.Erving won three championships, four Most Valuable Player Awards, and three scoring titles with the ABA's Virginia Squires and New York Nets and the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers. He is the sixth-highest scorer in ABA\/NBA history with 30,026 points . He was well known for slam dunking from the free throw line in Slam Dunk Contests and was the only player voted Most Valuable Player in both the American Basketball Association and the National Basketball Association.Erving was inducted in 1993 into the Basketball Hall of Fame and was also named to the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time team. In 1994, Erving was named by Sports Illustrated as one of the 40 most important athletes of all time. In 2004, he was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame. Most observers consider him one of history's most talented players; he is also widely acknowledged one of the game's best dunkers. While Connie Hawkins, \"Jumping\" Johnny Green, Elgin Baylor, and Gus Johnson performed spectacular dunks before Erving's time, \"Dr. J\" brought the practice into the mainstream. His signature dunk was the \"slam\" dunk, since incorporated into the vernacular and basic skill set of the game in the same manner as the \"cross-over\" dribble and the \"no look\" pass. Before Julius Erving, dunking was a practice most commonly used by the big men to show their brutal strength which was seen as style over substance, even unsportsmanlike, by many purists of the game. However, the way Erving utilized the dunk more as a high-percentage shot made at the end of maneuvers generally starting well away from the basket and not necessarily a \"show of force\" helped to make the shot an acceptable strategy, especially in trying to avoid a blocked shot. Although the slam dunk is still widely used as a show of power, a method of intimidation and a way to fire up a team , Dr. J demonstrated that the there can be great artistry, and almost balletic style, to slamming the ball into the hoop, particularly after a launch several feet from that target.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":102,"website":"http:\/\/sports.espn.go.com\/sports\/tennis\/news\/story?id=4068541","were_here_count":0,"id":"109407105745092","name":"Julius Erving","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Julius-Erving\/109407105745092","likes":95242}

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Diva A.J.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Is AJ Lee the figment of some Manga-geek\u2019s adolescent imagination? She exudes the perfect girl-next-door vibe, is a self-described video gamer, enjoys wearing Catholic schoolgirl plaids, and possesses the physical skills of a gymnast. But don\u2019t be fooled. She\u2019s not as innocent as she looks.\n\nAlthough she stands a petite, 5-foot-2 frame, AJ is a fierce competitor with an energetic, high-flying style that poses a threat to any Diva. This proud New Jersey native first introduced herself to the WWE Universe on the third season of WWE NXT. She finished in third place, but won many WWE fans with her lucha-inspired moveset and indomitable fighting spirit.\n\nA year after debuting on SmackDown in May 2011, AJ was pivotal in the 18-second outcome of the World Heavyweight Championship Match at WrestleMania XXVIII with a kiss to her beau, Daniel Bryan. The couple\u2019s subsequent breakup sent AJ into an emotional tailspin, and she has continued to develop crushes on WWE\u2019s top Superstars, including CM Punk.\n\nShortly after experiencing the love loss of Bryan, AJ began displaying a bizarre pattern of erratic behavior that caught the entire WWE Universe off-guard. Seemingly without reason, she slapped trusted confidante Kaitlyn and began inserting herself fearlessly into big-game situations involving her apparent love interests, including Kane, Punk and Daniel Bryan Daniel Bryan \u2014 whom she was slated to wed on Raw 1,000. \n\nThe happy couple\u2019s nuptials would come to a screeching halt WWE Chairman Mr. McMahon informed the WWE Universe that AJ is the new Raw General Manager, much to Bryan\u2019s dismay.\n\nAJ\u2019s tenure as Raw GM was short-lived, however, and she resigned from her post due to an alleged inappropriate relationship with John Cena, much to the delight of new Raw Managing Supervisor Vickie Guerrero. As The Queen Diva relished the opportunity to humiliate AJ and further expose her fraternization with the Cenation leader, the entire WWE Universe was shocked to learn the fiery Diva was actually in a steamy relationship with the 12-time World Champion, which earned AJ a Slammy Award for Best Kiss of the Year!\n\nEven more surprising was what transpired at WWE TLC, when AJ intervened in Cena\u2019s Money in the Bank Ladder Match with Dolph Ziggler, costing The Cenation Commander-in-Chief a World Championship opportunity and allowing her new boyfriend, The Showoff, to retain his Money in the Bank contract. The following night, AJ made it clear that her allegiance now lies with Ziggler and a mysterious heavy by the name of Big E Langston.\n\nAlthough AJ\u2019s \u201cZiggy\u201d and the imposing Langston were unsuccessful in capturing the WWE Tag Team Titles at WrestleMania, shrieks of disappointment became excited exclamations the following night on Raw. In AJ\u2019s home state of New Jersey, Ziggler cashed in his Money in the Bank contract on Alberto Del Rio to become the new World Heavyweight Champion. After winning a No. 1 Contender\u2019s Divas Battle Royal on Raw, it seems as though AJ is destined for a matching title as the stage is set for a high-stakes confrontation with her former best friend, Divas Champion Kaitlyn.\n\nAfter being pinned by her onetime confidante in a Six-Diva Tag Team Match on the May 6, 2013, edition of Raw, AJ no doubt thirsts for swift revenge against \u201cThe Hybrid Diva\u201d in their forthcoming Divas Title Match. Regardless of when that encounter will take place, one thing remains clear about this pint-sized powder keg: She always keeps us guessing.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Union City","state":"NJ","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":3078,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars\/divas\/divas","were_here_count":0,"id":"150788578283969","name":"A.J. - WWE","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/AJ-WWE\/150788578283969","likes":275132,"cover":{"cover_id":603536029675886,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/575527_603536029675886_300647503_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Since debuting in the Major Leagues in 2004, Molina has spent his entire career with the Cardinals and, as of 2013, has earned five consecutive selections to the All Star Game, six Rawlings Gold Glove Awards and one Silver Slugger Award. In the first ten years of career, the Cardinals appeared in seven playoff tournaments.Coming from a baseball family, Molina grew up in Bayam\u00f3n, Puerto Rico. His father was an amateur second baseman in Puerto Rico, and Yadier's two older brothers, Bengie and Jos\u00e9, were major league catchers from whom he learned the art of catching. Scouts observed Molina's pitch-handling and throwing skills, and the Cardinals selected him in the fourth round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft. Molina ascended through four levels of the minor leagues in four seasons, batting a combined.278. After debuting for the Cardinals, Molina quickly won a reputation for possessing one of the strongest and most accurate arms in the game.

{"about":"This page is not run by Mushfiqur Rahim himself. It's run by one of his close friends & Mushfiqur Rahim Knows about it, (Please Don't Use Bad Words In Any Comments, You Will Be Banned If You Do So!)\n","bio":"Mohammad Mushfiqur Rahim (Bengali: \u09ae\u09cb\u09b9\u09be\u09ae\u09cd\u09ae\u09a6 \u09ae\u09c1\u09b6\u09ab\u09bf\u0995\u09c1\u09b0 \u09b0\u09b9\u09bf\u09ae) (born 1 September 1988) is a Bangladeshi cricketer and captain of the national team. He made his Test debut in 2005, at the age of 16, during Bangladesh's first tour of England and the next year played his first One Day International. Between August 2009 and December 2010 Rahim served as Bangladesh's vice-captain. Standing 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m) tall, he specialises as a wicket-keeper and is a lower-order batsman. At domestic level he represents Rajshahi Division and captains Duronto Rajshahi.\n\nPersonal life: Mohammad Mushfiqur Rahim was born on 1 September 1988 to Mahbub Habib and Rahima Khatun. In between playing cricket, Rahim studied history at the Jahangirnagar University.Formerly, He finished his school life from Bogra Zilla School. He was due to miss the exams for his Master's degree in April 2012 as they clashed with Bangladesh's scheduled tour of Pakistan, however the tour was postponed and Rahim allowed to sit the exams.\n\nCareer: Before playing for the senior national team, Rahim played for Bangladesh Under-19s. He represented them in three Youth Tests and 18 Youth One Day Internationals (ODIs) between 2004 and 2006, averaging 31.75 and 36.00 with the bat in the respective formats. His only half-century in the Tests came against England. Rahim trained at the Bangladesh Institute of Sports. His coach there, Mohammad Salahuddin, praised his hard work, commenting: He comes from one of the most reputed and affluent families of his district. He could have had all the comfort in the world. Instead, he has decided to shape his life through hard work. His work ethic is exemplary, and he is absolutely single-minded about pursuing his goals \u2013 being successful in cricket and career. Mind you, he is academically very sound too. We have had individuals who have been far more talented than Rahim. But some have fallen by the wayside while others have not made the next leap forward. That is why he is different. He has not got distracted and hasn't lost focus. His level of determination is much higher than the average trainee and he carries himself with dignity. He is very polite and disciplined. You won't hear anything negative about him from anyone here.\n\nNational captain: On 20 September 2011, Rahim was named Bangladesh captain, taking over from Shakib Al Hasan after a disappointing tour of Zimbabwe. The announcement was made midway through the BCB Cup, a tournament involving the senior Bangladesh team, Bangladesh A, and a side made up of academy players. Rahim had already been captaining Bangladesh in the tournament on a temporary basis. The competition was won by Bangladesh A.\nBangladesh's next international engagement was hosting the West Indies in October for a T20I, three ODIs, and two Tests. In his first international match as captain, Rahim produced a Man-of-the-Match performance, scoring 41 not out from 26 balls to help his team to victory with one delivery to spare in the only T20I. Bangladesh lost the ODI series 2\u20131 and Rahim was his team's leading run-scorer with 100, including an innings of 69.[49] The following month, Pakistan toured for three ODIs and two Tests. Bangladesh lost the ODI series 3\u20130, and Rahim managed just 12 runs from three innings.\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board founded the six-team Bangladesh Premier League in 2012, a twenty20 tournament to be held in February that year. The BCB made Mushfiq the 'icon player' for Duronto Rajshahi. Under his leadership Duronto overcame a weak start to progress to the semi-finals where they lost to Barisal Burners; Rahim contributed 234 runs from 11 matches. In the 2012 Asia Cup, under Rahim's captaincy, Bangladesh won two out of the three games they have played and reached the final for the first time where they lost to Pakistan in the final. In April his grade A+ central contract was renewed.\n\nPlaying style: According to Jamie Siddons in 2010, then the Bangladesh coach, Rahim's batting is so versatile that he can bat anywhere in the top order, from one to six.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Puran Bogra","country":"Bangladesh","zip":""},"personal_info":"Full name: Mohammad Mushfiqur Rahim\nBorn: 1 September 1988 (Bogra, Bangladesh)\nHeight: 5 ft 3 in (1.60 m)\nBatting style: Right-hand bat\nRole: Wicket-keeper & national captain\nCaptain since: 20 September 2011\nNational side: Bangladesh\nTest debut: 26 May 2005 v England\nODI debut: 6 August 2006 v Zimbabwe","personal_interests":"Playing Cricket For Bangladesh \u003C3","talking_about_count":33283,"username":"MushfiqurRahimMitu","website":"http:\/\/www.cricinfo.com\/ci\/content\/player\/56029.html","were_here_count":0,"id":"551505481545830","name":"Mushfiqur Rahim","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MushfiqurRahimMitu","likes":158071,"cover":{"cover_id":572326949463683,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/379752_572326949463683_1923421523_n.jpg","offset_y":55,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Argentinean Wrestler, National Champ, South-American Champ, Bronze medal at Pan-Am Games, training for the 2016 Olympics. Live Your Passion!","bio":"He was born in Corrientes, Argentina, on April 5th, 1989, in a humble neighborhood of Corrientes, the Province Capital City. At the age of six, he moved to Buenos Aires with his family serching better working conditions for his parents and better educational level for him and his brothers. In his first years with sports activities he practiced several Olympic sports such as swimming and gymnastics, but at the age of nine he started to pay more attention on Olympic Wrestling. He performed in this discipline in a domestic level, achieving very good results from the begining, which encouraged him to a compromise even further with sports. His first appearence in internationals events representing his country was in 2001 in Chile, where he won the gold medal in the Barros Arana International Tournament. Since that event, his name never ceased to appear in Panamerican or Worldclass level international competitions.\nIn spite of his young age, he achieved many international titles representing his country in a professional way. Among his most important accomplishments we found twelve Panamerican Championships medals of several age categories, becoming the most winner of medals of this discipline in Argentina, and besides was the first to win a medal in the Panamerican Games after 20 years without a medal in this kind of competition. Along the years he was recognized with several awards, to prominents sportmen of Corrientes of the 'Secretar\u00eda de Deportes de la Provincia' (Province Sports Secretary), Award Revelation Clar\u00edn Deportivo (sports newspaper Clarin) in 2004, Jorge Newbery Award 2005 as the best sportman of Buenos Aires City in his discipline, and in several times named to Olimpia Awards as the best Argentine Sportman in Wrestling. Currently he belongs to KAV Mansfelder Land e.V. where he will wrestle the 2013\/2011 season in the Ringen Bundesliga (German National Wrestling League).\nAs it is well known, Olympic Wrestling is not a massive sport in Argentina, so Yuri was forced to travel aboard, far of his country, since the begining of his career to be able to get a better training and developement. He spent several seasons in different countries, such as Cuba, USA, Germany and Russia, and he had to be far away from his country for several years. In order to accomplish the results he longs for, he will move to Vladikavkaz, Russia, this present year 2012, determined to have a good training for the 2016 Olympic Games at Rio de Janeiro.","birthday":"04\/05\/1989","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":253,"username":"yurimaier","website":"http:\/\/www.YuriMaier.com\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"201519563220171","name":"Yuri Maier","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/yurimaier","likes":153195,"cover":{"cover_id":608110355894421,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1390481_608110355894421_294125110_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

He made his Test debut in November 1997 and played his first One Day International four months later. He played on Pakistan's Cricket Team as an attacking fast bowler.He has been involved in several controversies during his career, often accused of not being a team player but his presence was always felt by the opponents. Akhtar was sent home during the Test match series in Australia in 2005 for alleged poor attitude. A year later, he was embroiled in a drug scandal after testing positive to a banned substance. However, the ban imposed on him was lifted on court appeal. In September 2007, Akhtar was banned for an indefinite period for his fight with Pakistan team mate and fast bowler Mohammad Asif. On 1 April 2008, Akhtar was banned for five years for publicly criticizing the Pakistan Cricket Board. In October 2008, the Lahore High Court in Pakistan suspended the five-year ban and Akhtar was selected in the 15-man squad for the Twenty20 Quadrangular Tournament in Canada. Pakistani judge Rana Bhagwandas once stated that Akhtar is a legend of Pakistan cricket.

El f\u00fatbol de toque de bal\u00f3n con jugadores de gran t\u00e9cnica que impuso el denominado Dream Team de Johan Cruyff ten\u00eda su gozne en este centrocampista de t\u00e9cnica depurada que protege el bal\u00f3n como nadie y \"lee\" con admirable sencillez el ritmo que debe adquirir el partido en cada fase del juego. Al t\u00e9rmino de la Eurocopa de 2008, que gan\u00f3 la selecci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola por segunda vez en la historia, fue elegido Mejor Jugador del torneo, una distinci\u00f3n que raramente recae en un centrocampista y que reconoc\u00eda su fundamental aportaci\u00f3n. Xavi fue adem\u00e1s una pieza esencial en la consecuci\u00f3n del \"triplete\" del Bar\u00e7a (que gan\u00f3 en 2009 la Liga, la Copa del Rey y la Champions League) y en el triunfo de la selecci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola en el Mundial de Sud\u00e1frica en 2010, en el que Espa\u00f1a se proclam\u00f3 por primera vez campeona del mundo.\n\n\nXavi Hern\u00e1ndez\n\nSu progenitor, que fue jugador del Sabadell, le inculc\u00f3 la pasi\u00f3n por el f\u00fatbol. Los ojeadores del F\u00fatbol Club Barcelona le siguieron en varios partidos infantiles de la ciudad egarense a instancias del padre. Por fin, a los once a\u00f1os, hizo una prueba y en julio de 1991 ingres\u00f3 en la Masia, la residencia de las futuras estrellas del Bar\u00e7a que no proceden de la Ciudad Condal. Xavi se fij\u00f3 de inmediato en su maestro Josep Guardiola, su actual entrenador y figura clave del Dream Team en aquel entonces. Mir\u00e1ndose en aquel espejo, su progresi\u00f3n fue tan mete\u00f3rica que el propio Guardiola, que un d\u00eda lo observaba desde la banda en un partido de juveniles, pronostic\u00f3 a sus compa\u00f1eros: \"\u00c9ste nos va a jubilar a todos\". M\u00e1s o menos as\u00ed ser\u00eda. Xavi se convirti\u00f3 en el sucesor natural de Guardiola, a pesar de que de la cantera surgir\u00edan otros excelentes organizadores que se vieron obligados a abandonar las filas del club, como Cesc F\u00e1bregas o Vlikel Arteta, que disputan la Premier League inglesa y escocesa, respectivamente.\n\nSu predisposici\u00f3n para aprender cosas, la madurez que irradiaba a tan corta edad y su calidad futbol\u00edstica propiciaron que en la temporada 1997-1998 pasara del juvenil al Barca B, en el que de inmediato se convirti\u00f3 en el \"cerebro\" del equipo. Un equipo en el que Xavi no s\u00f3lo mandaba y organizaba, sino que marcaba goles con facilidad gracias a sus inesperadas llegadas al \u00e1rea y a su maestr\u00eda en el lanzamiento de faltas con barrera. Ya entonces, a pesar de su baja estatura (1,70 m) y su menuda complexi\u00f3n (pesa 63 kilos cuando est\u00e1 en plena forma), ser\u00eda un maestro en la conducci\u00f3n del bal\u00f3n y en la protecci\u00f3n del mismo.\n\nEn la temporada siguiente altern\u00f3 sus actuaciones con el B y con el primer equipo, con el que debut\u00f3 el 18 de agosto de 1998 de la mano del t\u00e9cnico neerland\u00e9s Louis Van Gaal, en un partido de la Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a ante el Real Mallorca. Fue titular y, adem\u00e1s, marc\u00f3 un gol. Van Gaal lo hizo debutar en la Liga el 3 de octubre de aquel mismo a\u00f1o en el Mestalla frente al Valencia, que cay\u00f3 derrotado por 1-3. Sus intermitentes actuaciones con el primer equipo dieron alas a un Bar\u00e7a alica\u00eddo que ocupaba la d\u00e9cima posici\u00f3n de la tabla. Xavi marc\u00f3 un gol decisivo que dio la victoria a su equipo en el campo del Valladolid, y a partir de aquella victoria, contando m\u00e1s asiduamente con su presencia, los azulgranas remontaron de forma tan espectacular que ganar\u00edan la Liga 1998-1999. Era su segundo t\u00edtulo profesional, porque poco antes hab\u00eda ganado el Campeonato del Mundo Sub-20 disputado en Nigeria.\n\n\n\nEn la temporada 1999-2000, debido a una lesi\u00f3n de Guardiola, Xavi se consolid\u00f3 en el primer equipo. Convencido de sus posibilidades, su juego madur\u00f3 exponencialmente. Entretanto, su estelar actuaci\u00f3n en Nigeria propici\u00f3 que el 15 de noviembre de 2000 debutara con la selecci\u00f3n absoluta ante los Pa\u00edses Bajos. Pocos a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s ya ser\u00eda convocado regularmente para defender los colores de Espa\u00f1a. A partir de la temporada 2000-2001, y con la marcha de Guardiola al calcio italiano, Xavi se convirti\u00f3 en titular indiscutible, tanto con Van Gaal como con los entrenadores subsiguientes: Carles Reixach, Radomir Antic y Frank Rijkaard. En el Barca, sin embargo, no alcanzar\u00eda su tercer t\u00edtulo, el de Liga, hasta el 14 de mayo de 2005, tras una marcha penosa del equipo y del club por un desierto de desprop\u00f3sitos. En verano del mismo a\u00f1o se proclam\u00f3 campe\u00f3n de la Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, t\u00edtulo que renovar\u00eda al a\u00f1o siguiente, en el que en el partido de vuelta marc\u00f3 un gol decisivo ante el Real Club Espa\u00f1ol, al que los azulgranas superaron por 3-0.\n\nHabitualmente las lesiones lo respetaban, por lo que siempre estuvo en forma cuando se requer\u00eda su participaci\u00f3n. S\u00f3lo cabe mencionar una rotura del ligamento cruzado anterior de la rodilla derecha en un entrenamiento en el Camp Nou, en diciembre de 2005. Aquel percance trunc\u00f3 su proyecci\u00f3n al obligarlo a estar ausente durante cinco meses, hasta finales de abril de 2006, fecha en que reapareci\u00f3 ante el C\u00e1diz C. F. Aquel a\u00f1o los azulgranas consiguieron de nuevo el t\u00edtulo de Liga y la Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a. Pero el mayor momento de gloria de aquel a\u00f1o 2006 para un equipo que funcionaba como una m\u00e1quina (gracias al trabajo de Xavi y Andr\u00e9s Iniesta en la medular y las genialidades de Ronaldinho y Eto'o en la delantera) lleg\u00f3 con la victoria en la Liga de Campeones, la asignatura pendiente del Bar\u00e7a, que s\u00f3lo ten\u00eda en sus vitrinas la conseguida por el Dream Team en 1992. Xavi, sin embargo, no pudo participar en la final ante el Arsenal F. C. debido a su baja forma por la lesi\u00f3n.\n\n\nCelebrando junto a Iniesta la Champions 2009\n\nEn 2007, en el partido de Liga de Campeones ante el Olympique de Lyon, disputado el 19 de septiembre, Xavi igual\u00f3 a Migueli como jugador del F. C. Barcelona que m\u00e1s partidos hab\u00eda disputado en competiciones europeas (85). Y super\u00f3 al m\u00edtico central ceut\u00ed el 2 de octubre de aquel mismo a\u00f1o en un partido frente al VfB Stuttgart. La diferencia, por supuesto, seguir\u00eda aumentando. En cuanto a sus partidos con el Bar\u00e7a, el 24 de noviembre de 2007 y ante el club decano espa\u00f1ol, el Recreativo de Huelva, igual\u00f3 la cifra de 400 partidos oficiales que ostentaba Guardiola.\n\nPero sin el t\u00edtulo de Campe\u00f3n de Europa de Naciones de 2008, en la que Xavi explot\u00f3 al m\u00e1ximo unas cualidades que no prodigaba (pases en profundidad al delantero con mayor ventaja y chutes desde fuera del \u00e1rea), no habr\u00eda ocupado las primeras p\u00e1gina de la prensa. En esa Eurocopa, disputada en Austria y Suiza, el centrocampista azulgrana, adoctrinado por Luis Aragon\u00e9s, adelant\u00f3 su posici\u00f3n con \u00e9xito rotundo. Marc\u00f3 su primer gol el 26 de junio frente a Rusia. Y en la final ante Alemania, Xavi dio el pase de gol a Fernando Torres, quien marc\u00f3 el \u00fanico tanto del encuentro. Su actuaci\u00f3n en la Eurocopa le vali\u00f3 el premio al Mejor Jugador de la competici\u00f3n, una menci\u00f3n que habitualmente recae en un delantero goleador. Los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, sin embargo, coincidieron en que era una elecci\u00f3n acertada. Adem\u00e1s de esta distinci\u00f3n mayor, Xavi hab\u00eda sido galardonado como el mejor futbolista de las temporadas 1998-1999 y 2004-2005 por la revista deportiva Don Bal\u00f3n, y ya en 1999 hab\u00eda recibido el premio El Pa\u00eds como futbolista revelaci\u00f3n.\n\n\nCon David Villa en la final de la Eurocopa 2008\n\nSi con la selecci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola hab\u00eda vivido uno de los mejores momentos al ganar la Eurocopa, la temporada 2008-2009 le reservaba a\u00fan un destino superior: ser parte esencial, junto con Iniesta, de la organizaci\u00f3n del juego del F.C. Barcelona en la que fue sin duda la mejor temporada de la historia del club. El Bar\u00e7a, en efecto, logr\u00f3 algo tan ins\u00f3lito en el f\u00fatbol mundial como el \"triplete\", la victoria en los tres torneos en que participaba: la Liga espa\u00f1ola, la Copa del Rey y la Champions League. El juego exhibido por el equipo maravill\u00f3 a todo el mundo; por supuesto que fue el nuevo entrenador, su admirado Josep Guardiola, el principal art\u00edfice de esa revoluci\u00f3n, pero tales \u00e9xitos no son concebibles sin organizadores de la talla de Iniesta y del propio Xavi.\n\nLa temporada 2009-2010 sum\u00f3 su quinto t\u00edtulo liguero a su palmar\u00e9s, tras una re\u00f1id\u00edsima competici\u00f3n en la que el F\u00fatbol Club Barcelona y el Real Madrid alcanzaron registros vertiginosos tanto en goles como en puntos, ganando 31 de los 38 partidos disputados. El Bar\u00e7a, que se anot\u00f3 tambi\u00e9n la Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, no pudo sin embargo revalidar su victoria en la Champions League al caer en semifinales.\n\nFinalizada la temporada, el Mundial de Sud\u00e1frica de 2010 deparar\u00eda a Xavi el \u00faltimo t\u00edtulo que le quedaba por ganar. Pese a la decepcionante derrota inicial frente a Suiza, la selecci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola entrenada por Vicente del Bosque se mantuvo fiel a su estilo, y de la mano de Xavi y de sus restantes cerebros centrocampistas (Iniesta, Xabi Alonso, Cesc F\u00e0begras) encaden\u00f3 una victoria tras otra hasta derrotar a Alemania en las semifinales y a Holanda en la final. Por primera vez, despu\u00e9s de d\u00e9cadas \u201csin pasar de cuartos\u201d, Espa\u00f1a se proclamaba campeona del mundo.\n\nJugador m\u00e1s bien fr\u00edo en el campo, sus compa\u00f1eros alaban su entereza y su capacidad para remontar un partido que parece perdido. No va de estrella medi\u00e1tica, aunque cualquier equipo de \u00e9lite estar\u00eda encantado de contar con sus servicios. Pero \u00e9l se siente tan identificado con su club de toda la vida y con su afici\u00f3n que no ha escuchado los cantos de sirena de otras ligas y otros clubes; piensa retirarse en el Barcelona, cuyo entrenador lo mima y dosifica por temor a las lesiones, aline\u00e1ndolo en los partidos clave. De la temporada 2010-2011 sin duda se recordar\u00e1 el extraordinario gol con que Xavi abri\u00f3 el marcador frente al Madrid de Mourinho.\n","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"Barcelona, TERRASSA, Spain","zip":""},"talking_about_count":4729,"username":"Elmaestro.Xavier","website":"http:\/\/www.xavihernandez.com ","were_here_count":0,"id":"424281067591316","name":"Xavi Hernandez","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Elmaestro.Xavier","likes":303526,"cover":{"cover_id":651539911532096,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1238128_651539911532096_976800920_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

","affiliation":"SSC Napoli ","bio":"R\u0130VER PLATE\n\nHigua\u00edn started playing in the youth teams and made his debut with River Plate in a 2\u20131 defeat against Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata on 29 May 2005.[1] On 12 February 2006, he scored his first league goal in a 3\u20131 victory over Banfield.[2] Higua\u00edn ended the 2005\u201306 season with five goals in 12 appearances.[3]\nFollowing his brace in the Supercl\u00e1sico derby against Boca Juniors on 8 October 2006, River Plate manager Daniel Passarella declared that Higuain had an \"enormous future\" and was \"destined for superstardom.\"[4] In the following season, he scored eight goals in 17 league matche\n\nREAL MADR\u0130D\n\nOn December 2005, Spanish club Real Madrid signed \nHigua\u00edn for \u20ac13 million, after River Plate had earlier turned down a \u20ac10 million offer for the 19-year-old striker.[5] His debut came on January 11 2007 against Real Betis in the second round of the Copa del Rey in Seville. His presentation at the League came 3 days later, on January 14 2007, against Real Zaragoza at home. Higuain was involved in the creation of numerous scoring chances and in the assistance for the only goal, which earned Madrid the victory. His first goal with Real came on February 24 when the team faced Atletico Madrid in the Madrid derby, scoring the tying goal (1-1) at the Estadio Vicente Calder\u00f3n. Later on the season, Higua\u00edn showed an impressive performance by scoring a last minute goal on a league match against RCD Espanyol to earn his team a 4-3 victory when the tie was rampant on the scoreboard.[6] However, during his first season in the Bernabe\u00fa, Higua\u00edn arose some doubts over his performance due to his lack of goals.\nDuring the 2007-08 season, Higua\u00edn faced a rather intermittent performance. Yet, during the last stages of the league he managed to consolidate an impressive display. He first scored a last minute goal to earn his team a victory in a 2-1 comeback against Osasuna, which allowed Real Madrid to be mathematically crowned League Champions for the second consecutive year. [7] Four days later, Pipita arose to the spotlight once more by scoring the 3rd goal of a 4-1 trashing over Barcelona in El Cl\u00e1sico. This performance was particularly praised due to Higua\u00edn scoring his goal barely 57 seconds after coming in from the bench. [8]\nIn the 2008-09 season Higua\u00edn was offered the chance to be a starter due to the serious injury suffered by the Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy.[9]. On April 21 2009, he accounted another great performance when he defined the match against Getafe with a goal in the last minute, giving Real Madrid a 3-2 victory which enabled the team to follow the trail of Josep Guardiola\u00b4s Barcelona. [10] In August 2008, Higua\u00edn scored the winner in Madrid's victory over Valencia in the Spanish Supercup. [11] Shortly afterwards, he scored all four goals in a 4-3 win against M\u00e1laga. Because of this, he started to gain international recognition, at the same time he got to be one of the leading goalscorers of the Spanish League, alongside his Barcelona counterpart, Samuel Eto'o.[12] That season, the striker was devoted as one of the great promises of world football in the wake of spectacular games, and particularly dazzling last-minute goals. Higua\u00edn ended the season with 22 league goals,[13] 24 in all competitions, shining alongside longtime soccer stars like Diego Forl\u00e1n, David Villa and Thierry Henry.\nThe 2009-10 season saw Higua\u00edn become Real's top goalscorer with 27 league goals, 29 in total, being at the same time the Spanish League's 2nd top goalscorer, behind only to Lionel Messi but suprassing Swedish international Zlatan Ibrahimovic and even his fellow teammate Cristiano Ronaldo.\nIn June 2010, Real Madrid extended Higua\u00edn's contract until 2016.[14] On October 23 2010, he scored Real Madrid's 5200 league goal, against Racing Santander on a 6-1 trashing by the Whites. On November 4 of the same year, Gonzalo enters the history of Real Madrid by being the author of the club's 700th goal in the Champions League.[15]\nOn the first weeks of December 2010, Higua\u00edn was diagnosed with a herniated lumbar disc, and was suggested by Real's medical staff to have it operated.[16] Even though he's still pending a second opinion, he's likely to spend 3-4 months away from the field on a recovery process.[17]\n\n NAT\u0130ONAL SELECT\u0130ON\n\nGonzalo was summoned for the Selection of soccer of youthful Argentina sub 18, but as France (its country of birth) does not allow the double citizenship, he decided not to obtain the Argentinean not to lose the French. This would prevent him, besides playing for the selection of its country, to have communitarian passport, something very important nowadays at the time of being transferred Europe. Therefore, it decided to resign to this call. Even so, the player indicated his intention to dress celestial and the white one, and who if he arrived the day would be a difficult decision to take with the family.\nIn France they compared its race with the one of David Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet, whose father also is Argentine and ended up playing with the French selection. In November of 2006 it was summoned by Raymond Domenech to play with France in a friendly one in front of Greece, but it returned to refuse also to its country of origin and decided not to play for no until outside transferred the old continent.\nIn January of the 2007, after an arduous investigation, player it managed to find the point legal that the Argentine nationality without losing the communitarian passport allowed him to become, thanks to the fact that the law of neither countries questions the other citizenship whereas the applicant has not decided on the Argentine nationality from the date of expedition of the French certificate of nationality to the majority of age. This finding can allow him in the future to play for the selection that it prefers without losing his European communitarian passport.\nFinally Higua\u00edn was summoned by Sergio Batiste for a preparatory friendly party for the Olympic games. The 6 of February of 2008 make debut against Selection of soccer of Guatemala, being the author of two goals where its selection gained 6 to him to 0 to Guatemala. [7] In spite of it, the party was not considered by the FIFA as an encounter the International To, reason why tells neither to their goals nor the disputed be it.\nIn September of the 2009, first call arrives the moment from his at the Argentina Selection of the hand of Diego Arming Maradona. It declared \u201cIs an immense joy and that hoped long ago. Now I am going to try to do all the possible one so that the Selection obtains the classification to the World-wide one\u201d\nThe 10 of October its first party like player of the Argentina Selection was celebrated, this it gambled against Peru and the Pipita (nickname with that is known it in Argentina) was the one who turned the first goal of a party that finished 2-1 in favor of Argentina, Martin Palermo would still mark the second leaving the Argentina Selection with possibilities of participating in next the World-wide one of South Africa 2010.\nMaradona aligned to Higua\u00edn of titling next to Messi in the albiceleste advantage for the last party of classification in front of Uruguay.

Ryback approaches every challenge with brute force and a no-nonsense demeanor that exudes supreme confidence in his own abilities. He doesn\u2019t just possess the skills to destroy a rival at any time \u2014 he carries himself as if that result is never in doubt.\n\nOne only needs to observe how Ryback\u2019s fellow Superstars study him to understand his ruthless reputation. They stare in awe as if they\u2019re watching disaster footage, looking on in shock as Ryback\u2019s ferocity both impresses them and leaves them fearful of being his next target.\n\nHow can anyone measure such an intimidating beast in comparison to the rest of his WWE competition? Few words may deem suitable as he starts to make his mark in the ring by leaving a long line of battered opponents in his wake. And after coming to the rescue of such WWE luminaries as Mick Foley, Jim Ross and WWE Chairman Mr. McMahon, the fledgling behemoth proved his intimidating presence can make any competitor back down \u2014 including WWE Champion CM Punk.\n\nOnly forces beyond Ryback\u2019s control manage to keep the hulking Superstar in check. A rogue referee decided to make a name for himself at Ryback\u2019s expense during the main event at WWE Hell in a Cell 2012. A trio of NXT upstarts called The Shield started their invasion in WWE by targeting the imposing newcomer at Survivor Series 2012 and during the first Raw of 2013. A legend looking for redemption relegated Ryback to runner-up status in the 2013 Royal Rumble Match.\n\nThat legend, John Cena, now sits in the brawny competitor\u2019s crosshairs as a result. Ryback, whose WrestleMania debut ended in defeat to Mark Henry, took out his aggression on the WWE Champion with no clear motive other than wanton destruction. Ryback later explained his actions as a response to feeling betrayed and dismissed by a Cenation leader who was singularly focused on redeeming his own career. Now, he intends to step out of Cena\u2019s shadow and become \u201cthe biggest threat to [Cena\u2019s] WWE Title reign.\u201d And the powerful Superstar will get that chance when he challenges the Cenation leader for the WWE Championship at Extreme Rules 2013.\n\nRegardless of who might dismiss his long-term prospects for success in WWE, Ryback continues to develop his formidable talents and sheer power with each passing day.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Las Vegas","state":"NV","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":1020,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars\/ryback","were_here_count":0,"id":"212597172183684","name":"Ryback - WWE","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ryback-WWE\/212597172183684","likes":211299,"cover":{"cover_id":457975804312485,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1379924_457975804312485_1767779269_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Alberto Del Rio","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Born into Mexican nobility, Alberto Del Rio is the son of famous luchador Dos Caras, who is linked by blood to Spanish royals Ferdinand and Isabella. Although hailing from a wealthy family, Del Rio has great empathy for the working class in addition to his passion for high culture.\n\nDuring summer 2010, Del Rio debuted in WWE, making an immediate impact on SmackDown by interrupting and insulting the 619\u2019s own Rey Mysterio. Later that night, Del Rio backed up his bluster by making the former World Champion tap out to his signature Cross Armbreaker. Del Rio quickly followed up on his early success by winning several high-profile matches, including 2011\u2019s 40-Man Royal Rumble Match and WWE Money in the Bank\u2019s Raw Ladder Match that July. These triumphs were key in helping Del Rio fulfill his \u201cdestiny\u201d at 2011\u2019s SummerSlam, where he cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to defeat CM Punk and become the first-ever Mexican-born WWE Champion.\n\nIn October 2011, Alberto Del Rio captured championship gold a second time, in a Triple Threat Match against CM Punk and John Cena at WWE Hell in a Cell. In April 2012, Del Rio officially became a SmackDown Superstar. Day by day, the Mexican Superstar is proving that his unbounded talent, pride and aggression are more than just a formula for winning inside the ring, but the very \u201cEssence of Excellence\u201d in WWE.\n\nDel Rio\u2019s quest to capture the World Title ran through Night of Champions, where he faced World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus. Heading into the pay-per-view, Del Rio built up a great deal of momentum, even playing an intricate role in SmackDown General Manager Booker T\u2019s banning of Sheamus\u2019 signature Brogue Kick. It seemed that the affluent Superstar\u2019s destiny would be fulfilled, but Booker T reinstated the maneuver before the contest at Night of Champions, and Del Rio ultimately fell to the bottom of Sheamus\u2019 boot.\n\nFor Del Rio\u2019s next target, he set his sights on Randy Orton, attacking The Viper before a No. 1 Contender\u2019s Match. The attack kept Orton from winning that contest, but Del Rio wasn\u2019t done. He unleashed a wave of assaults against Orton, mocking The Viper\u2019s signature poses and christening himself as the \u201cnew Apex Predator of WWE.\u201d At Hell in a Cell, however, Del Rio's attempt to supplant the pecking order fell short when Orton defeated him with his signature RKO.\n\nJust more than a month later at WWE TLC, Del Rio found himself in strange company, teaming with The Miz & The Brooklyn Brawler to challenge and defeat bullies-turned bandmates 3MB.\n\nThen, on the Jan. 8 SmackDown taping, Del Rio finally fulfilled his World Title destiny, defeating Big Show in an epic Last Man Standing Match to claim the World Heavyweight Championship. The new champion was victorious once again in a rematch at the Royal Rumble with identical stipulations, and he made the challenger tap out in another encounter at Elimination Chamber.\n\nDel Rio's next challenge came from Jack Swagger. The self-proclaimed \"Real American,\" along with his xenophobic associate Zeb Colter, felt that Del Rio's Mexican heritage was part of the reason that the America they once knew was fading away. The two met at WrestleMania 29 with the World Heavyweight Title on the line. Though he found himself trapped in Swagger's Patriot Lock, Del Rio fought his way out, eventually forcing his challenger to tap out to the Cross Armbreaker.\n\nThe following night on Raw, Del Rio won his match against Jack Swagger, but was injured during the bout. Taking full advantage of the champion's weakened knee, Mr. Money in the Bank, Dolph Ziggler, decided to cash in. Though he fought valiantly, the combination of an amped-up Showoff and an aching knee was too much for Del Rio to overcome, and Ziggler claimed the World Title.\n\nDel Rio will have a chance at World Heavyweight Championship redemption, however, when he squares off against The Showoff and old foe Jack Swagger at Extreme Rules in a Triple Threat Ladder Match with the title on the line.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"San Luis Potos\u00ed","state":"","country":"Mexico","zip":""},"personal_info":"Alberto Del Rio came to WWE  from the Mexican elite.

{"birthday":"01\/17\/1942","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942) is a retired American boxer and former three-time World Heavyweight Champion. To date, he remains the only man to have won the linear heavyweight championship three times (the linear title is recognized by tracing an - almost - unbroken lineage of titleholders going back over 100 years, with nearly every champion defeating the previous titleholder in the ring). Ali was also the winner of an Olympic Light-heavyweight gold medal. In 1999, Ali was crowned \"Sportsman of the Century\" by Sports Illustrated and the BBC.\n\nCassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., was born in Louisville, Kentucky. He was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr., who was named for the 19th century abolitionist and politician Cassius Clay. Ali changed his name after joining the Nation of Islam in 1964, subsequently converted to Sunni Islam in 1975 and then Sufism.[1]\n\nAli was known for his fighting style, which he described as \"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\". Throughout his career Ali made a name for himself with great handspeed, as well as swift feet and taunting tactics. While Ali was renowned for his fast, sharp out-fighting style, he also had a \"great chin\", displaying great courage and an ability to take a punch throughout his career.","personal_interests":"Biography\n\nEarly life\n\nCassius Clay, Jr., was born on January 17, 1942. His father, Clay Sr., painted billboards and signs, and his mother, Odessa Grady Clay, was a household domestic. Although Clay Sr. was a Methodist, he allowed Odessa to bring up both Clay boys as Baptists.[2]\n\nAmateur career; Olympic gold\n\nClay was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer, Joe E. Martin, who encountered the then twelve-year-old Cassius Clay fuming over the fact that his bicycle had been stolen.[3] However, without Martin knowing, Clay also began training with Fred Stoner at another gym.[who?] In this way, he could continue making $4 a week on Tomorrow's Champions, a TV show that Martin hosted, while benefiting from the coaching of the more-experienced Stoner, who continued working with Clay throughout his amateur career.[who?]\n\nClay's last amateur loss was to Kent Green of Chicago, who could say he was the last person to defeat the champion until Ali lost to Joe Frazier in 1971 as a pro. Under Stoner's guidance, Cassius Clay went on to win six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, two national Golden Gloves titles, an Amateur Athletic Union National Title, and the Light Heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.[4] Clay's record was 100 wins, with five losses, when he ended his amateur career.\n\nAli states (in his 1975 autobiography) that he threw his Olympic gold medal into the Ohio River after being refused service at a 'whites-only' restaurant, and fighting with a white gang. Whether this is true is still debated, although he was given a replacement medal during the opening ceremony of the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where he lit the torch to start the games.\n\nEarly professional career\n\nAfter his Olympic triumph, Clay returned to Louisville to begin his professional career. There, on October 29, 1960, he won his first professional fight, a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker, who was the police chief of Fayetteville, West Virginia.\n\nStanding tall, at 6-ft, 3-in (1.91 m), Clay had a highly unorthodox style for a heavyweight boxer. Rather than the normal style of carrying the hands high to defend the face, he instead relied on foot speed and quickness to avoid punches and carried his hands low.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1963, the young fighter amassed a record of 19-0, with 15 knockouts. He defeated boxers such as Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, Lamar Clark (who had won his previous 40 bouts by knockout), Doug Jones and Henry Cooper.\n\nClay built a reputation by correctly predicting the round in which he would \"finish\" several opponents, and by boasting before his triumphs. Clay admitted he adopted the latter practice from \"Gorgeous\" George Wagner, a popular professional wrestling champion in the Los Angeles area who drew thousands of fans. Often referred to as \"the man you loved to hate,\" George could incite the crowd with a few heated remarks, and Ali followed suit.\n\nAmong Clay's victims were Sonny Banks (who knocked him down during the bout), Alejandro Lavorante, and the aged Archie Moore (a boxing legend who had fought over 200 previous fights, and who had been Clay's trainer prior to Angelo Dundee). Clay had considered continuing using Moore as a trainer following the bout, but Moore had insisted that the cocky \"Louisville Lip\" perform training camp chores such as sweeping and dishwashing. He also considered having his idol, Sugar Ray Robinson, as a manager, but instead hired Dundee.\n\nClay first met Dundee when the latter was in Louisville with light heavyweight champ Willie Pastrano. The teenaged Golden Glove winner traveled downtown to the fighter's hotel, called Dundee from the house phone, and was asked up to their room. He took advantage of the opportunity to query Dundee (who was working with, or had, champions Sugar Ramos and Carmen Basilio) about what his fighters ate, how long they slept, how much roadwork (jogging) they did, and how long they sparred.\n\nFollowing his bout with Moore, Clay won a disputed 10-round decision over Doug Jones in a matchup that was named \"Fight of the Year\" for 1963. Clay's next fight was against Henry Cooper, who knocked Clay down with a left hook near the end of the fourth round. The fight was stopped in the fifth due to deep cuts over Cooper's eyes.\n\nDespite these close calls, Clay became the top contender for Sonny Liston's title. Despite his impressive record, however, he was not widely expected to defeat the champ. The fight was scheduled for February 25, 1964 in Miami, Florida, but was nearly canceled when the promoter, Bill Faversham, heard that Clay had been seen around Miami and in other cities with the controversial Malcolm X. At the time, The Nation of Islam \u2014 of which Malcolm X was a member \u2014 was portrayed as a \"hate group\" by most of the media. Because of this, news of this association was perceived as a potential gate-killer to a bout where, given Liston's overwhelming status as the favorite to win (7-1 odds[5]), had Clay's colorful persona and nonstop braggadocio as its sole appeal.\n\nFaversham confronted Clay about his association with Malcolm X (who, at the time, was actually under suspension by the Nation as a result of controversial comments made in the wake of President Kennedy's assassination, which he called a case of \"the chickens coming home to roost\"). While stopping short of admitting he was a member of the Nation, Clay protested the suggested cancellation of the fight. As a compromise, Faversham asked the fighter to delay his announcement about his conversion to Islam until after the fight. The incident is described in the 1975 book The Greatest: My Own Story by Ali (with Richard Durham).\n\nDuring the weigh-in on the day before the bout, the ever-boastful Clay, who frequently taunted Liston during the buildup by dubbing him \"the big ugly bear\" (among other things), declared that he would \"float like a butterfly and sting like a bee,\" and, summarizing his strategy for avoiding Liston's assaults, said, \"Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see.\"\n\nFirst title fight\n\n    Main article: Muhammad Ali versus Sonny Liston\n\nClay, however, had a plan for the fight. At the pre-fight weigh-in, Clay's pulse rate was around 120, more that double his norm of 54. Liston, along with others, misread this as nervousness, and as such, was typically over-confident and unprepared for any result other than a quick knockout victory in his favor. In the opening rounds, Clay's speed kept him away from Liston's powerful head and body shots, as he used his height advantage to beat Liston to the punch with his own lightning-quick jab.\n\nBy the third round, Clay was ahead on points and had opened a cut under Liston's eye. Liston regained some ground in the fourth, as Clay was blinded by a substance in his eyes. It is unconfirmed whether this was something used to close Liston's cuts, or deliberately applied to Liston's gloves for a nefarious purpose; however, Bert Sugar (author, boxing historian and insider) has recalled at least two other Liston fights in which a similar situation occurred, suggesting the possibility that the Liston corner deliberately attempted to cheat.\n\nWhatever the case, Liston came into the fourth round aggressively looking to put away the challenger. As Clay struggled to recover his vision, he sought to escape Liston's offensive. He was able to keep out of range until his sweat and tears rinsed the substance from his eyes, responding with a flurry of combinations near the end of the fifth round. By the sixth, he was looking for a finish and dominated Liston. Then, Liston shocked the boxing world when he failed to answer the bell for the seventh round, later claiming a shoulder injury as the reason. Cassius Clay had indeed \"Shook up the world!\" just as he had promised.\n\nIn the rematch, which was held in May 1965 in relatively-remote Lewiston, Maine, Ali (who had by now publicly converted to Islam and changed his name) won by knockout in the first round as a result of what came to be called the \"phantom punch.\" Many believe that Liston, possibly as a result of threats from Nation of Islam extremists, or in an attempt to \"throw\" the fight to pay off debts, just wanted to call it a day and waited to be counted out (see Muhammad Ali versus Sonny Liston). Others, however, discount both scenarios and insist that it was a quick, chopping Ali punch to the side of the head that legitimately felled Liston.\n\nIn November 1965 Ali fought Floyd Patterson in his second title defense including his rematch with Liston. Ali completely dominated Patterson, who lost by technical knockout at the end of the 12th round. Ali savagely beat Patterson, because of his refusal to call Ali by his new name, and Patterson's denouncement of the Nation of Islam. Ali defended his title seven times in 1966 and 1967.\n\n...\n\n(cf Wikipedia)","talking_about_count":295,"were_here_count":0,"id":"31094044651","name":"Mohamed Ali","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Mohamed-Ali\/31094044651","likes":221375}

{"about":"The official WWE Universe Facebook page for Daniel Bryan.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Daniel Bryan is no up-and-comer. Trained by WWE Hall of Famer Shawn Michaels, Bryan competed on the indy wrestling circuit for more than 10 years. Honing his craft on multiple continents, Bryan became well-known for his hybrid of Japanese and American offensive styles that made good use of vicious elbow strikes, precise kicks, spine-jarring suplexes and various torturous submission maneuvers like the \u201cNo!\u201d Lock, formerly named after martial arts specialist Gene LeBell.\n\nFirst coming to WWE as part of the inaugural season of WWE NXT, Bryan soon made it clear he was destined for great things.\n\nAfter shaking the drama of The Nexus \u2014 which formed out of WWE NXT season one contestants \u2014 Bryan refocused his efforts on a solo career, exciting the WWE Universe with his unique in-ring style and bone-snapping artillery.\n\nEventually, the determined Superstar\u2019s efforts came full circle, when he enjoyed his first (vegan) taste of title gold in WWE from then\u2013United States Champion The Miz, his former WWE Pro. In summer 2011, Bryan proved he had more tricks up his sleeve when he won the Money in the Bank Ladder Match, which propelled the skilled grappler to his greatest achievement: the World Heavyweight Championship. After Bryan cashed in at WWE TLC 2011, the weightier prize around his waist wasn\u2019t the only difference in the typically humble competitor. Bryan's in-ring performance only got better while holding the World Title, but his newfound attitude distanced him from the WWE Universe that once pulled for the underdog.\n\nAfter losing the World Heavyweight Title at WrestleMania XXVIII in record-breaking time, the former champ broke up with longtime girlfriend AJ Lee. His former gal began her tenure as Raw General Manager by having Bryan taken away by men in white coats for a psychiatric evaluation. Although he was diagnosed with no official mental ailments, Bryan\u2019s behavior became increasingly erratic. The self-affirming Superstar defeated Kane at The 25th Anniversary of SummerSlam, and the two entered anger management therapy together. One week after attempting to \u201chug it out,\u201d their anger management counselor Dr. Shelby arranged for the duo to team up in a match, and the odd couple shockingly became No. 1 contenders to the WWE Tag Team Championship. An even bigger shocker? Kane & Daniel Bryan actually won the titles at Night of Champions 2012!\n\nDubbed Team Hell No by the WWE Universe in a RAWactive vote, the pair slowly got on the same page. Further unity was forced upon them when Kane & Bryan incurred the wrath of Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns \u2014 a trio known as The Shield. Team Hell No joined forces with Ryback to face the so-called enforcers of \u201cjustice\u201d in a massive Six-Man Tables, Ladders & Chairs Match at WWE TLC 2012, which was won by the NXT invaders.\n\nThe year 2013 began a bit more positively, as Kane and Bryan officially graduated Shelby\u2019s program, initiating a mass hug between the Superstars, Shelby, Jerry Lawler, Michael Cole, Dr. Sampson, Justin Roberts and the entire WWE Universe.\n\nKeeping the good feelings going, Team Hell No successfully defended their titles against Team Rhodes Scholars at the Royal Rumble, but weren\u2019t on the same page later that night in the Royal Rumble Match. After Bryan eliminated his own partner, the smaller of the champions found himself knocked out of the ring and into Kane\u2019s arms. The Big Red Monster, left with the decision of dropping his pal or placing him back in the bout, decided on the former. The fickle friends butted heads again during the Elimination Chamber Match in February to determine the No. 1 Contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, though they had seemingly mended fences by March.\n\nTeam Hell No remained on the same page throughout March and April, defeating Dolph Ziggler & Big E Langston at WrestleMania 29 to retain their WWE Tag Team Titles. On Raw the night after The Show of Shows, Team Hell No came to the aid of Kane's brother, The Undertaker, to help The Phenom fend off a 3-on-1 attack by The Shield. At Raw in London on April 22, Team Hell No will join forces with The Deadman to take on The Shield in an epic Six-Man Tag Team Match.\n\nAs Bryan\u2019s short fuse persists, attempts to calm him down have been met with belligerent cries of \u201cNo!\u201d With or without the support of WWE fans, Daniel Bryan strives to force the arms of every opposing Superstar to tap out so that only his may be raised with a triumphant and self-aggrandizing \u201cYES!\u201d","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Aberdeen","state":"WA","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":3049,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"322398166570","name":"Daniel Bryan - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Daniel-Bryan-WWE-Universe\/322398166570","likes":452479,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151574942506571","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/988246_10151574942506571_526459025_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Dedicated to Younis Khan's most loyal fans.","affiliation":"PCB","awards":"Numerous Man of The Match Awards, ICC Test Batsmen Ranking Top, ICC WC T20 2009 etc.","bio":"One of Pakistan's modern batting greats, Younis Khan is the kind of man who responds best in adversity. A Test average of over 50, a triple-hundred, a famous double-hundred against India in India, and a brilliant rearguard partnership to clinch Pakistan's 3-0 Test whitewash over England, leave no doubt about his quality and class. \n\nHe is also one of the most successful fielders for Pakistan, and can bowl respectable slow-medium. As a captain, Younis has enjoyed success in leading Pakistan to the world Twenty20 title in 2009. Much of his persona evokes the idea of the quintessential Pathan warrior - committed, inspired, capable, and bearing the burden of conflict with fortitude and poise. Born in Mardan, a prominent city in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Younis moved at an early age to Karachi, where he caught the eye of Rashid Latif and Saeed Anwar at Malir Gymkhana, one of the city's renowned sports clubs.\n\n The relationship with Latif blossomed into a nurturing mentorship, guiding Younis towards entry onto the world stage. After two impressive domestic seasons, he got a Test call-up, and marked it with a century on debut. Style and aesthetics are not his strongest points. His technique relies on a good deal of bottom hand, which deprives it of the fluidity and grace that is typical of Asia's best batsmen. Yet when Younis gets going, he produces results in the face of steep odds. Indeed, the steeper the odds, the more Younis seems to thrive.\n\n His match-winning 267 and 84 not out in Bangalore came after a string of low scores prompted a sarcastic comment from the team manager that leaked into the media. His greatest captaincy feat - the world Twenty20 championship in England - was achieved weeks after Pakistan cricket had been devastated by the terror attacks in Lahore. And though his triple-century came at home on a flat track, the innings began under pressure when Younis, eschewing the night watchman, stepped out himself in the dying moments of the second day with Pakistan staring at a huge Sri Lankan total. \n\nUnsurprisingly for a rearguard specialist, Younis has emerged a master of the fourth innings. Among players with 1000 or more fourth-innings Test runs, his average is among the highest. Along with these accomplishments, Younis's career has also seen turmoil. Inability to control infighting within the team and display tact with the PCB led to him losing the captaincy in late 2009, and he effected a moody refusal when circumstances changed and it was offered again.\n\n His nature is to be inward-looking and intensely focused, quietly fighting his way through. While this makes for a reclusive personality that shuns the media and runs afoul of officialdom, it has also been the source of Younis's batting strength and his extraordinary resilience as a cricketer.","birthday":"11\/29\/1975","category":"Athlete","description":"Dedicated to Younis Khan's most loyal fans.","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"DHA","city":"Karachi","state":"","country":"Pakistan","zip":"74000"},"personal_info":"Full Name\nMOHAMMAD YOUNIS KHAN. \n\nBirthday\nNovember 29, 1977.\n\nBirthplace\nMardan, North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwah)  Pakistan.\n\nStar Sign\nSagittarius.\n\nHeight\n5ft 11in.\n\nNickname\nYK\n\nResidence\nKarachi.\n\nFamily\nMarried (2 children); Six older brothers, three older sisters.\n\nEducation\nIslamia Arts & College, Karachi .\n","personal_interests":"Cricket, Football, Fishing etc.","talking_about_count":19088,"username":"313YK","website":"http:\/\/www.espncricinfo.com\/ci\/content\/player\/43652.html","were_here_count":0,"id":"148715015151314","name":"Younis Khan","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/313YK","likes":156603,"cover":{"cover_id":648393915183419,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1463415_648393915183419_983663892_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

He scored his maiden ODI hundred, against Canada in a tri-series before the 2007 World Cup and a year later hit his first against a better attack - Pakistan's. His bowling has been penetrative and economical and his partnership with fellow left-armer Abdur Razzak has been a bonus for Bangladesh. Shakib rattled New Zealand with 7 for 36 in the 2008 Chittagong Test, which till date are the best figures by a Bangladesh bowler in an innings. His sensational batting took Bangladesh to their first ever tri-series final, against Sri Lanka, the following year.

It was also India's first gold medal since 1980, when the Men's Field Hockey Team won the gold. He is the first and only Indian to have held both the World and Olympic titles at the same time, a feat he accomplished by capturing the Gold Medal at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, after having won the gold at the 2006 ISSF World Shooting Championships.CareerEarly yearsAbhinav Bindra was born in the home of Punjabi Sikh family. He studied at The Doon School for two years before moving to St. Stephen's School, Chandigarh; he graduated from Stephen's in 2000. His parents had an indoor shooting range installed at their home in Patiala, Punjab. His Mental Coach was Surabh Bhattacharjee and Abhinav Kumar residing in Patna, who has been closely associated with him since the beginning of his career. Bhattacharjee and Lt. Col. Dhillon (who was also his first Coach) were the first ones to spot the potential in Abhinav. Bindra was the youngest Indian participant at the 2000 Olympic Games. His current coach is five-time Olympic shooter Gabriele B\u00fchlmann from Basel, Switzerland, with whom he trained in Germany before the Olympics. In the 2000 Olympics Bindra achieved a score of 590, placing him 11th in the qualification round, and did not qualify for the finals since only the top eight competed in the finals. After his disappointing performance, Bindra said that he has no plans to retire from shooting.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":110,"were_here_count":0,"id":"103764946329498","name":"Abhinav Bindra","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Abhinav-Bindra\/103764946329498","likes":111192}

{"about":"The Official Facebook Page of Stuart Broad","bio":"In his early cricketing career, Broad had been shaping up to be an opening bat just like his dad Chris, until he suddenly shot up. Within 18 months he had transformed himself into a medium-fast bowler and was playing for England Under-19 and Leicestershire's first XI. A few months later and he's gone from England's A team to a call-up to the full one-day side. Talk about a meteoric rise.\n\n\"I thought I may as well try bowling because I can't just stand around in the field all day,\" he shrugged - and promptly took 9 for 72 for England Under-19s in ODIs against Sri Lanka and 30 first-class wickets at 27.69 in ten matches in 2005.\n\nBut those early years as a batsman did not go amiss. After his first eight Tests, he had racked up three half-centuries from the pivotal No. 8 position, and push his Test average above 40 - a mark his father (39.54) just missed out on over the course of his 25-match career.\n\nAt the age of just 19, he was called into the England A set-up in the West Indies to replace James Anderson who flew out to bolster the seniors in India and was twice selected for England A during the 2006 season.\n\nHis early performances for the one-day team, against Pakistan, were promising but he was left out of the Champions Trophy, but more out of a feeling of not wanting to push him too hard, too soon. He was named in the Academy team to be based in Perth during the Ashes and by the end of the winter he had joined the World Cup squad in the Caribbean.\n\nInjury deprived him of a Test debut in May 2007, but he marked his return to the one-day side with 3 for 20 against West Indies at Lord's, and he was then announced in England's squad for the first Test against India in July. His stock continued to rise on tour with England in Sri Lanka when his 11 cheap wickets helped them to a 3-2 series victory.\n\nHe was then called up for the subsequent Test series in December, making his debut on a slab of Colombo concrete and toiling for 36 sweaty overs. The subsequent tour of New Zealand proved to be his making, however. With Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison both lacking form, he was selected for the Wellington Test. The decision was immediately vindicated, if not with a huge match-haul then certainly by the composure and control he showed.\n\nThe following Test in Napier, however, demonstrated his immense allround talent. A vital 42 helped prop up England's first innings before he took 3 for 54, testing all New Zealand's batsmen with pace and bounce. A diving catch at backward square leg confirmed, if there were any doubts, that England had found themselves a Test cricketer of rare class and even rarer composure.\n\nThat impression continued to climb during England's home season in 2008 when no less a technical purist as Geoffrey Boycott likened his tall elegant batting style to Sir Garfield Sobers. Although he has struggled at times for consistency with his bowling, his unmistakable talent was out on show again against South Africa in Durban in 2009 as helped bowl England to a famous innings victory.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_interests":"The Broad Appeal \n\nWebsite: thebroadappeal.org\nTwitter: \u0040thebroadappeal","talking_about_count":9850,"username":"StuartBroadOfficial","website":"http:\/\/www.stuart-broad.com\/, http:\/\/twitter.com\/StuartBroad8","were_here_count":0,"id":"154546228008190","name":"Stuart Broad","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/StuartBroadOfficial","likes":166199,"cover":{"cover_id":354263041369840,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc1\/s720x720\/1002464_354263041369840_392081054_n.jpg","offset_y":37,"offset_x":0}}

I was fortunate enough to have a rich childhood in terms of having lots of friends and a good family. I was always outside playing sports and other games with the kids from the neighborhood. Often I was told that I am too small and I will never make it in the NFL, but I didn't care what they told me. I just simply believed in myself, which is why I am here today playing running back for the New Orleans Saints!\n\nGoing undrafted was a surprise and at the same time no surprise at all. I knew I had my work cut out for me. Shortly after the draft I received a call from the New Orleans Saints inviting me to attend their camp where I would compete for a roster spot. I knew it was not going to be easy, but I never gave up. I always believed. I earned a spot on the roster as a rookie playing on the special teams and the rest is history.\n","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"Welcome to the Official Pierre Thomas Facebook fan page.

{"about":"The official WWE Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar David Otunga.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"After winning notoriety in the world of reality TV (on VH1\u2019s \u201cI Love New York 2\u201d) and in American tabloids (as the fianc\u00e9 of Grammy and Academy Award-winning actress, Jennifer Hudson), David Otunga began making headlines of his own on WWE NXT\u2019s inaugural season.\n\nAs anyone confronted with Otunga's impressive physique can testify, the competitor has more than his fair share of brawn and good looks. But he backs up these natural gifts with intelligence, all powered by a blue chip Harvard Law School education.\n\nAlthough he failed to win WWE NXT, Otunga made a powerful opening statement on Raw, where he joined winner Wade Barrett and his fellow season one Rookies to form The Nexus. This destructive faction, incensed by their perceived poor treatment on NXT, dismantled Superstars indiscriminately, demanding that management grant them bona fide contracts. \n\nThanks to the Anonymous Raw General Manager, Otunga finally signed with WWE in 2010. He\u2019s made the most of his opportunity since, notching the WWE Tag Team Championship twice, with Michael McGillicutty as well as one-time Nexus member John Cena.\n\nIn late 2011, Otunga flew solo and provided pro bono legal counsel to John Laurinaitis \u2014 in between contesting matches with the likes of Randy Orton and Sheamus. After Big Johnny was ousted from WWE, Otunga began representing others, including Ricardo Rodriguez in a lawsuit against World Heavyweight Champion Sheamus. \n\nThe suave Superstar even lit up the silver screen, cast as a police officer in the 2013 Halle Berry film \"The Call.\"\n\nThe jury is still out on the bowtied, litigious Otunga, who comes across like a super-sized Carlton Banks these days. But he knows as well as anyone, in the WWE court of law, the burden of proof is on him to make his case as a legitimate title contender.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Diva Layla.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Utilizing skills honed while a member of the Miami Heat dance squad, Layla won the 2006 Diva Search to earn her opportunity in WWE.\n\nThe flirty contest winner made her first appearance at that year\u2019s SummerSlam, and then the English-born beauty took her sweet dance moves to ECW, where she wowed the WWE Universe as part of the Extreme Expos\u00e9.\n\nBy 2009, Layla joined forces with Michelle McCool to form Team Lay-Cool on SmackDown. The \u201cFlawless\u201d duo seemed inseparable, even going as far as referring to themselves as the self-professed \u201cco\u2013Women\u2019s Champions\u201d when Layla held the title. But it wasn\u2019t long before Layla enjoyed her own time in the spotlight.\n\nAlongside McCool in a 2-on-1 Handicap Match for the title, Layla pinned Beth Phoenix in May 2010 on SmackDown to become the first-ever British Women's Champion, and with that accolade, she also became the last Women\u2019s Champion, as the title was retired shortly thereafter.\n\nThings started to unravel between Lay-Cool in 2011, culminating with a Loser Leaves WWE Match at Extreme Rules, which saw the end to their friendship and McCool\u2019s departure from WWE. Despite the victory over her ex-friend, an injury sidelined the British beauty for the rest of the year.\n\nAfter lengthy rehab on her knee, Layla finally returned to the ring at Extreme Rules 2012 where she defeated Nikki Bella to win the Divas Title, proving that she hadn\u2019t lost a step in her time away from the squared circle.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Wade Barrett.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Trained in bare-knuckle brawling on the mean streets of Preston, England, Wade Barrett brings strength, arrogance and cunning to the ring in equal measure. He\u2019s also imbued with confidence and eloquence, character traits that have propelled the cocky young Brit to the top ranks in WWE. \n\nSince coming to WWE prominence as the winner of WWE NXT season one, Barrett has proven he\u2019s not content merely to share the spotlight with his fellow Superstars. He wants total control, and he\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes to get it.\n\nAfter winning NXT, Barrett shocked the WWE Universe by forming the splinter group The Nexus and staging a hostile takeover on Raw. The Nexus quickly made their intentions clear following their debut, running roughshod on Monday nights and promoting an agenda of fear and intimidation. Barrett\u2019s cold and ruthless leadership proved difficult to withstand. Even the mighty John Cena couldn\u2019t withstand the onslaught, first becoming a lackey to Barrett\u2019s goon squad and then being unceremoniously ousted from WWE after Barrett ordered his firing.\n\nAfter Cena was reinstated, Barrett jumped over to SmackDown, forming The Corre, intent on dominating Friday nights just as handily as he had Mondays. Shortly thereafter, Barrett defeated Kofi Kingston to become the Intercontinental Champion. He then used The Corre as hired muscle to ensure he would keep the championship gold until the group imploded along with Wade\u2019s Intercontinental Title reign. With no other Superstars at his side, the scheming Superstar employed his self-proclaimed \u201cBarrett Barrage\u201d \u2014 a one-man mission of mercilessness that targeted even those at WWE\u2019s peak, most notably Randy Orton.\n\nFollowing a partially dislocated elbow that kept him out of action for nearly seven months, a reinvigorated Barrett made his intense return to WWE in September 2012. The English Superstar used his downtime to get back to basics and \u201creignite the flame\u201d \u2014 presumably through participation in the sort of bare-knuckle boxing he took part in early in his past.\n\nKnocking out anyone in his path with a devastating elbow strike he\u2019s dubbed the Bull Hammer, Barrett racked up victory after victory upon his return, establishing himself as a contender for the Intercontinental Title, which he captured on the Dec. 31, 2012, edition of Raw.\n\nBarrett then set his sights on the Royal Rumble Match and the prize of a World Title opportunity at WrestleMania 29. Barrett had an impressive showing in the over-the-top-rope classic, but was ultimately eliminated by NXT upstart Bo Dallas, who the Brit intends on sending back to the developmental territory he came from.\n\nHe\u2019s also making his foray into films with a role in \u201cDead Man Down.\u201d Barrett beamed as he introduced the film\u2019s trailer on Raw, saying it would make him a star. The Brit isn't taking kindly to anyone who tries to diminish his role in the flick. After Chris Jericho and The Miz ragged on him during the March 11 edition of Raw, Barrett set off a brawl during their No. 1 Contender\u2019s Match that night.\n\nBarrett later defeated both men in a Triple Threat Match. Overconfidence may have cost the British Superstar a match against The Awesome One on the March 26 Raw, though. The Intercontinental Champion brashly interrupted Triple H, leading The Game to deliver a vicious low blow. In the match, Barrett tapped out to The Miz\u2019s Figure-Four Leglock. The result was the same on the WrestleMania 29 Interactive Pre-Show, but this time, The Awesome One walked out of MetLife Stadium with the Intercontinental Title.\n\nThe Brit was on the warpath after his loss, and in a rematch little more than 24 hours later, he reclaimed the Intercontinental Championship from The Miz. With a vicious Bull Hammer elbow, Barrett won his third Intercontinental Title on Raw! Things seemed to be back on track for the former bare-knuckle brawler, until the following week on Raw, when he was upset by R-Truth in a non-title match. Barrett once again found himself needing to bounce back. He did exactly that with two impressive victories, over Justin Gabriel on WWE Main Event and William Regal on a SmackDown from London, respectively.\n\nArmed with an arsenal of brutal strikes, there\u2019s not a doubt in anyone\u2019s mind The Barrett Barrage is back on course.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Stats:\nHeight: 6 feet 5 inches\nWeight: 265\nFrom: Manchester, England","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Manchester","state":"","country":"United Kingdom","zip":""},"talking_about_count":266,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"333832427272","name":"Wade Barrett - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Wade-Barrett-WWE-Universe\/333832427272","likes":343695,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151361976352273","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/940916_10151361976352273_234571543_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

That background has made her a natural to be featured on some of WWE's biggest pay-per-views such as WrestleMania XXVI, Survivor Series 2011 and Royal Rumble 2011, where she triumphed in a Fatal 4-Way Match to claim her second Divas Championship.\n\nEve is willing to use more than just her athletic abilities to get ahead, though. She showed that when she admitted to toying with Zack Ryder\u2019s heart in order to get her arms around John Cena in the early part of 2012. The ploy revealed the Diva to be more conniving than WWE fans ever imagined, but it also proved that nothing will stop her from getting what she wants.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Eve Torres stats \nFrom: Los Angeles\nCareer Highlights: Winner of the 2007 WWE Diva Search","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":290,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"8389000757","name":"Eve Torres - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Eve-Torres-WWE-Universe\/8389000757","likes":360450,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150771209890758","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/561773_10150771209890758_527626879_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

","birthday":"08\/28\/1983","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"galle","zip":""},"personal_info":"Separamadu Lasith Malinga (born August 28, 1983 in Galle) is a Sri Lankan cricketer. He bowls at a very fast pace with a slinging action, releasing the cricket ball low. This distinctive action has earned him the nickname 'Slinga Malinga'. He took six wickets in his Test debut against world champions Australia in 2004. He has constantly troubled batsman with his lively pace and well directed bouncers during his maiden tour of Australia along with his unique bowling action that many batsmen struggle to adapt to.\n\nSubsequently, during the tour of New Zealand in 2004\/2005, his action was found so hard to play by the Kiwi batsmen that the captain, Stephen Fleming requested the umpire to remove his red tie so that they would be able to see the ball being released from Malinga's hand. The umpire did not do so.\n\nAlong with the bouncer, he has a variety of balls, which also include the yorker, which is very hard to play, considering the fact that he regularly bowls between 140 KM and 150 KM.\n\n\nLasith Malinga was the surprise selection for Sri Lanka's tour to Australia in 2004, though he had a fearsome reputation on the domestic circuit. Malinga bowls with a distinctive and explosive round-arm action which generates genuine pace and can disconcert batsmen who struggle to pick up the ball's trajectory. Already, he is rated the fastest bowler in Sri Lanka. His first performance in Sri Lankan colours was also impressive - he took 6 for 90 against a Northern Territory Chief Minister's XI. That paved the way for his inclusion in the Test team, and he acquitted himself quite well too, dismissing Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist in the same over.He is developing into Sri Lanka's key pace-bowling wicket-taker, especially as Chaminda Vaas continues to lose pace. Although he remains quite erratic and has a prope\n\nClaim to fame: Only bowler in the history of one day cricket to pic up 4 wickets in 4 consecutive balls.","personal_interests":"love very much to sleep","talking_about_count":7481,"username":"Lasith.malinga.99","were_here_count":0,"id":"128429940500441","name":"Lasith Malinga","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Lasith.malinga.99","likes":384219,"cover":{"cover_id":637031609640269,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/994529_637031609640269_528751094_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"3 times World Superbike Champion: 2001 - 2006 - 2008 - \u0040TroyBaylisstic on twitter -\nBaylisstic21 on Instagram","bio":"Troy was born on the 30th March 1969, the only son of Warren and Lorraine and his childhood years were spent on the family farm in Taree, New South Wales, Australia with his sister, Jana.\nAt the age of six, Troy\u2019s father gave him a \u201cMonkey\u201d bike to ride around the farm and by the age of 10 he had decided it was time to go racing! For the next four years he traveled the circuits with his father racing in motocross and dirt track events.\nHis love of action sports then led Troy towards surfing and he spent all his spare time on the beach. He met his future wife, Kim, at the age of 18 and his craze for physical fitness made him turn his competitive spirit towards cycle racing. What kind of cycle racing? All kinds\u2026 mountain bikes, speed trials, triathlons. If it had pedals, Troy raced it!\nIn 1992 the attraction of motorcycle racing was too great for Troy to resist and he returned to motorcycle racing, but this time around he would try his hand at road racing. His first races were on his ZXR750 street bike but he thought that he had better \u201cget serious\u201d and changed it for a 250 Sports Production bike.\nHe rode the Kawasaki KR1 in the 250 Sports Production class and was soon winning club events. By the end of the year he entered a few Australian National Sports Production races and won those too. This was fun!\n1993 was a busy year for Troy not only because he wanted to mov\ne up to a bigger bike but also because he married his girlfriend, Kim.\n\nHaving discovered the thrill of racing on circuits, and being eager to start moving up the ladder, Troy raced a Kawasaki 600 and progressed to competing in a few Australian national events by the end of the year.\nIn 1994 Troy rode the same bike to 6th in the Australian National 600 Championship and won the 600 race at Bathurst.\nTroy was, by now, proving that he was a force to be reckoned with in Australia and in 1995 he confirmed that reckoning by taking 2nd place in the championship.\nBy 1996 it was time for Troy to move up another step and, with the backing of Team Kawasaki Australia, entered the Australian Superbike Championship and finished an incredible 3rd.\nIt was in 1997 that the world would see Troy compete in two great World Championship events and recognise his talent and potential. Not only did he improve upon his 1996 placing by finishing 2nd in the Australian Superbike Championship aboard the Ansett Air Freight Suzuki but, entered as a wildcard, he amazed world class teams by finishing 5th in both races of the Phillip Island World Superbike round.\nIf anyone needed further proof of his abilities, they surely had it when the Grand Prix event rolled into town at Phillip Island and, once again as a wildcard entry, Suzuki offered Troy a ride on their 250cc machine. Suzuki had struggled all year to have good results in this incredibly competitive class but Troy immediately qualified it 6th on the grid and even battled for the lead before finally finishing 6th in the race.\nHe thought that the GPs might be his next step but for a phone call from somebody watching that 250 GP race from the other side of the world. If Troy thought that he had made it in 1997, then he certainly hadn\u2019t bargained on the events of the next three years.\nDarrell Healey was the Englishman who had been watching the 1997 Phillip Island 250 GP from the other side of the world.\nAs owner of the Team GSE, he phoned Troy directly after the GP and invited him to move to England to race the GSE Ducati in the British Superbike Championship.\nAt the beginning of 1998, Troy moved his family to England and finished 8th in what was probably the toughest National Championship in the world: The British Superbike Championship.\nIn 1999 having settled into the incredibly professional GSE team, Troy was ready for action. Qualifying in six pole positions and five front row positions (excluding poles), he scored six wins and 14 podium finishes in all and won the British Championship by 28 points.\nTroy was British Superbike Champion! Because he had won the series on a Ducati, his trophy was presented by none other than the World Champion, King Carl Fogarty. Next stop: the United States of America!\n2000 was a typical example of how unpredictable racing can be. Troy had already moved from Australia to England and now, in February of 2000, he moved from England to the US in order to ride a Ducati for the Vance & Hines team in the AMA Superbike Championship. He immediately impressed with his aggressive riding style and set pole position at his first race in the Daytona 200, but crashed out during the race. He then moved on to round 2 at Sears Point and, once again, put the Ducati onto pole position but the race was cancelled because of adverse weather conditions.\nBy this time, Troy was straining at the leash to show how fast he could be. He wouldn\u2019t have to wait long\u2026 Back in Phillip Island, Australia - the place where it had all started for Troy three years ago - World Champion Carl Fogarty had crashed during the second leg of the World Superbike event there. He was badly injured. Troy's phone rang again\u2026 he was approached by the Ducati factory in Italy to replace the injured \u201cKing Carl\u201d. As Troy said, \u201cI get a call from Ducati asking if I was interested in the ride. I didn\u2019t need asking twice!\u201d\n\nTroy crossed the Atlantic again to replace the injured Carl Fogarty and soon astounded the public with a series of spectacular performances. He and the Ducati Infostrada team would only have to wait a few races before he chalked up his first race win at World Championship level.\nThe win, at the incredibly fast Hockenheim circuit in Germany, was followed by another win in front of a supportive British crowd around the very technical Brands Hatch circuit. Troy was now proving himself convincingly.\nTroy\u2019s first ever visit to Assen in Holland left fans in no doubt that he is one of the most spectacular riders in the world. Through awful weather conditions, his battle with the Japanese rider Noriyuki Haga had TV viewers gasping. On a track that was dry on one side of the circuit and wet on the other, the two riders swapped the lead corner after corner until Troy slid off of his Ducati and walked back to the pit garage.\nIt was a walk that had become a common sight during 2000 but everyone around Troy realised that his ability to push the limits is the trademark of a future World Champion.\nDespite missing six races in the 2000 season he had finished 6th in the World Superbike Championship. Troy\u2019s rise to the top has been meteoric but now he faced his biggest step in motorcycle racing: The final step to becoming the Superbike World Champion.\nCombining talent, determination and consistency is what is needed to win the World Superbike Championship. And that was exactly what Troy did.\nThe 2001 season was a fresh start for Troy. From the very start, he put himself on the podium and continued to stay there race after race. And it wasn\u2019t long before he started putting himself at the very top of the podium. By the end of the season, Troy had logged an impressive six wins and nine other podium finishes. In 2001 Troy was crowned World Superbike Champion !\nDespite his dominant riding, however, the title was not as easy as it looked for Troy. In the first race of the 11th round at Oschersleben, he experienced his only technical problem of the year and had to withdraw from the race. This allowed his nearest rival to climb back up in points and threaten Troy\u2019s championship hopes. This disturbing change of events might have pressurised other riders, but it didn\u2019t bother the Aussie. Instead, Troy put the incident behind him and proceeded to get back on the podium in the second race. This race day highlighted what is best about Troy: His ability to take each race as it comes. No other rider comes close to keeping the focus on the moment the way Troy does.\nTroy helped Ducati back to the very top in 2001. He scored their 100th pole position, helped them win their 10th Manufacturers\u2019 Title and won their 9th Riders\u2019 Title\nAs World Champion, 2002 wouldn\u2019t be any different for Troy. It would be another year made up of individual races. It would be another year in which he was determined to succeed.\nThe reigning World Champion started 2002 on an incredible note with six 1st place finishes, putting him into the record books with the most consecutive wins at the start of any season.\nEven after his streak was brought to a halt at Sugo - probably the toughest track to win at for non-locals - Troy resumed his double-winning form at Monza and then again at Lausitzring and Misano. He tallied an incredible six double-wins, with 14 wins overall in the season.\nTroy showed his characteristic grit when he crashed at Brands Hatch and damaged his back and ribs. In spite of the severe beating, he got back on his bike and rode through the pain to 3rd and 2nd place finishes. Not even the crash at Assen, which allowed his nearest rival to slip ahead in the standings by one point, would cause the Aussie\u2019s confidence to waver: \u201cNow I\u2019ve got to go out and do it all at Imola.\u201d\nImola will be forever remembered. Racing fans around the world saw one of the most spectacular races in history at this \u201cwinner takes all\u201d event. Troy Bayliss and Colin Edwards fought two incredible battles, swapping the lead and sometimes their paint too! In the end there could only be one winner and on that day it was Edwards.\nTroy finished the championship second overall, but no one will forget the grace in which he conceded his title: There was still a big smile for all his fans as he stepped up to the podium after this final race of the season. Troy\u2019s tremendous efforts throughout the year had, however, helped Ducati win their 11th Manufacturers\u2019 Title.\n2003 was to be a big year for both Troy and Ducati as they moved into MotoGP together. The effort invested in the new Ducati MotoGP Team had been massive and pre-season tests were encouraging. Troy was to have to deal with the pressures of being at the sharp end of a project in which both the press and fans now expected so much. Few doubted that Troy would carry his characteristic \u201cnever say die\u201d attitude with him, but apart from it being the first year for the Desmosedici machine, most realised that few riders actually make the transfer from Superbike to Grand Prix successfully. They should not have counted Troy in that number! Few were disappointed when the lights finally turned to green on Troy\u2019s first MotoGP season. It may have been a different championship but it was the same old Troy.\nTwo front row positions, three podium places and 6th in the World Championship was an incredible start in MotoGP. Just two points in the series stole 5th position away from Troy and the \u201cRookie of the Year\u201d award but if the world of Grand Prix had never heard of Troy Bayliss before they certainly knew him now. In just the second GP of the year and at a circuit he\u2019d never seen before, Troy took the lead in the South African GP at Welkom from the third row of the grid and held it until one-third distance. He fought tooth and nail with reigning World Champion Valentino Rossi at half race distance and eventually brought the Ducati home in 4th position.\nBy the next race in Jerez, Troy Bayliss was not only on the podium but also on the lips of every race fan around the world. This 34-year-old family man, who had been given the chance to rocket to fame in World Superbike, was now doing the same in MotoGP seemingly oblivious to the fact that he was now rubbing shoulders with the fastest riders on the planet. To Troy, it was just another bike and just another race and his \u201cjust get on with the job\u201d attitude continued to win him fans from all around the world.\nIn 2004 Troy lined up with his team-mate Loris Capirossi once again for the Ducati Moto GP team. Competing at this level will never be easy, and this was a tough season, particularly after a great rookie year, the expectations were high.\nThe end of this season will see Troy leave Ducati after many successful years with the Italian brand.\nAdmittedly Troy had a season below expectations but he finished in great style with a podium finish at Valencia. After the race Troy commented: \"You probably haven't seen me smile like this for a while ... It's been a tough year for me and everyone at Ducati but the bike has come good in the second half of the season. And after we tested some new stuff at Phillip Island it's felt like a new bike for me. \"\n\"I really wanted to have a go at Max (Biaggi) but in the end I thought third was better than putting it in the dirt. I've had some great years with Ducati, with some great times together, so it's nice to leave on a happy note. I wish them all the best for the future, I know they're going to have a strong bike in 2005.\"\nTroy finished 14th in the championship.\nThe 2005 season will see former World Superbike champion Troy Bayliss break his long time Ducati links with a move to the satellite Camel Honda Team, joining veteran Brazilian GP rider Alex Barros for the 2005 MotoGP World Championship.\n\"For me the switch from Ducati to Honda is a bigger change than coming from Superbikes to MotoGP,\" commented Troy. \" But it is a challenge which I am ready to take on and it gives me a lot of motivation\".\nFull of challenges and never at home on his new ride, the season unfolded as a very difficult one for Troy. After an average first half season, news got worst when Troy injured his wrist while training on his motocross bike in Australia. Troy will then miss Motegui , his home race Phillip Island and eventually the rest of the season's races.\nTroy Finished overall in 12th position in the championship.\nThe 2006 season will see Troy bring back his aggressive and spectacular riding style to World Superbikes.\nTroy Bayliss is, to put it simply, a legend for Ducati and the 36-year-old from Taree in Australia now returns to the championship where he made his name. The Ducati Xerox Team rider will surely be one of the protagonists in this year's series.\n\u201cThe biggest thing is that it feels like I\u2019m coming home ... and I don\u2019t mean to Australia!\u201d commented Bayliss. \u201cEven though the bike has changed quite a lot, the engine is still very similar and has been much improved since I\u2019ve been away so it\u2019s a built-in package already waiting there for me. It reminds me of the bike I rode in 2002, especially after the couple of changes we made during the recent tests in Qatar. I think I\u2019m pretty much there, it just needs a little bit of fine-tuning because we\u2019re already at the level we expected to be. The championship is looking strong now, all the manufacturers are back and it\u2019s going to be great to be there with Ducati and challenge all the other guys for the title.\u201d\n2007 always SBK Ducati Xerox and 2008 he won his 3 World SBK Title and he wrote THE END on his carrier in WSBK Championship.\nNow he is Ducati collaudator and instructor and world ducati image man.","birthday":"03\/30\/1969","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"Management \/ Manager\nSponsorships and events \/ Sponsorizzazioni ed eventi\n\nSilvia Mangione silvia\u0040sgagency.it\nSilvia Borella silvia.borella\u0040sgagency.it","personal_interests":"Bike","talking_about_count":8242,"username":"Troy.Bayliss.21","website":"http:\/\/www.troybayliss.com ","were_here_count":0,"id":"19531332694","name":"Troy Bayliss","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Troy.Bayliss.21","likes":215950,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151262541422695","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/424418_10151262541422695_1209177247_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

In 1976 the Kerala State Government started a Sports School for women, and Usha was chosen to represent her district.CareerIn 1979 P. T. Usha participated in the National School Games, where she was noticed by O. M. Nambiar, who coached her throughout her career. Her debut in the 1980 Moscow Olympics proved lacklustre. In the 1982 New Delhi Asiad, she got the silver medal in the 100m and the 200m, but at the Asian Track and Field Championship in Kuwait a year later, Usha took the gold in the 400m with a new Asian record . From 1983-89, Usha garnered 13 golds at ATF meets.At the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, she finished first in the semi-finals of the 400 metres hurdles, but narrowly missed a medal in the finals, reminiscent of Milkha Singh's 1960 defeat. There was a nail-biting photo finish for the third place. Usha lost the bronze by 1\/100th of a second. She became the first Indian woman (and the fifth Indian) to reach the final of an Olympic event by winning her 400m hurdles semi-final.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":312,"website":"http:\/\/www.indianathletics.in\/records\/Records\u002520seniors\u002520(As\u002520on\u00252031.12.2011).pdf","were_here_count":0,"id":"113041012044041","name":"P.

Bond is a right-arm fast bowler. His fastest recorded delivery was clocked at 156.4 km\/h against India in the 2003 World Cup.Bond's career was plagued with injuries, chiefly recurring stress fractures of the back. He had surgery in 2004 to try to prevent further injury, but it was only partially successful. In recent years he has suffered back problems, knee injuries and an abdominal tear. These problems, in conjunction with a late start to his fully professional cricket career, have limited his appearances in both international and domestic cricket. Since his debut in the 2001\/02 season, he only managed to appear in 18 Test matches for New Zealand.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Heath Slater.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Fueled by a mouth that never stops running and arrogance as scorching as the shock of red hair on his head, Heath Slater certainly lives up to his self-imposed moniker, \u201cThe One-Man Band.\u201d\n\nHailing from West Virginia, Slater first exploded onto the WWE scene as a rookie on WWE NXT\u2019s inaugural season. Right out of the gate, Slater made an impact, defeating Carlito and becoming the first-ever NXT Rookie to defeat a WWE Pro in a singles match. From there, he teamed up with The Nexus, joining Wade Barrett in his hostile takeover of WWE. After CM Punk staged a coup and emerged as the new leader of The Nexus, Slater walked away from the group and helped form the splinter faction, The Corre. As the black and yellow arm-banded group had on Raw, The Corre set about on a mission of domination on SmackDown, targeting Superstars like Edge, Big Show and Kane.\n\nSlater was a key member of the collective and managed to win the WWE Tag Team Championship with Justin Gabriel, defeating Vladimir Kozlov & Santino Marella at WWE Elimination Chamber 2011. The Corre even landed a match at WrestleMania XXVII, taking on Big Show, Kane, Santino and Kofi Kingston. They came up short in that bout, setting off a chain of events that led to the group\u2019s ultimate dissolution.\n\nSince the crumbling of The Corre, Slater rocked forth, trying to make an impact as a singles star. The only thing standing in his way? A long line of WWE Legends, including Vader, Diamond Dallas Page and Bob Backlund, who have put a damper on Heath's good time.\n\nAs The One-Man Band attempted to recover from devastating losses to a host of Legends, Slater formed a band of other underachievers including Jinder Mahal and Drew McIntyre. On the Oct. 1 edition of Raw, the three reminded the WWE Universe that they intend to achieve great success. Two weeks later on Raw, the motley crew identified themselves as 3MB and took a Nashville, Tenn., open mic night by storm. The trio is as dangerous in the squared circle as they are on a concert stage. On the Survivor Series Pre-Show, Slater and Mahal defeated Team CoBro -- Santino Marella & Zack Ryder -- when McIntyre played a dastardly role at ringside.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Stats:\nHeight: 6 foot 2\nWeight: 230 pounds\nFrom: West Virginia","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Pineville","state":"WV","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":198,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"315841261378","name":"Heath Slater - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Heath-Slater-WWE-Universe\/315841261378","likes":179086,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151431130426379","source":"http:\/\/sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash2\/s720x720\/216221_10151431130426379_1525805003_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}


{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Evan Bourne.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"Don't let all his boyish smiles and peace signs cloud your judgment. Next thing you know, Evan Bourne will be executing a Shooting Star Press off a ladder \u2013 from just above those clouds \u2013 right onto your face.\n\n\"Air Bourne,\" as he calls the move, is perhaps the most breathtaking aerial assault in WWE, but it's far from the only trick in the high-flyer's arsenal. Bourne has proven time and time again that he's willing to throw caution to the wind, especially when opponents least expect it. When you look like a happy-go-lucky sprout in a land of snarling giants, extreme measures need to be taken.\n\nLeave it to the hardcore faithful, then, to be the first to embrace Bourne in his WWE debut. The electric youngster dazzled ECW crowds in 2008 and 2009 and proved he wasn't afraid of taking on much bigger combatants like Mike Knox. It didn't take him long to win over the WWE Universe, either, as he took home a Slammy Award for \"Best Finishing Maneuver\" in his rookie year.\n\nRaw viewers who watched Bourne team up with Rey Mysterio in 2008 were no doubt drawing some comparisons. That's because Mysterio, another acrobat who's more dangerous than his size indicates, has long been one of the blossoming Superstar's idols.\n\nOver the years, Bourne has continued to play the role of David in bouts against Goliaths with matches against Sheamus and Jack Swagger, whom he defeated at WWE Capitol Punishment in 2011. But the contests that have truly showcased Bourne's action-packed style have been Money in the Bank Ladder Matches, one of which took place on The Grandest Stage of Them All.\n\nBourne has made it clear he's not done climbing to new heights and, in his ascent, the ranks of WWE. Teaming up with fellow high-adrenaline Superstar, Kofi Kingston, wound up being his most spectacular move yet. The dynamic duo known as Air Boom won the WWE Tag Team Championships on the Aug. 22, 2011 edition of Raw, launching Bourne to new heights.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Evan Bourne stats:\nHeight: 5 foot 9\nWeight: 185 pounds\nWWE Debut: June 10, 2008","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":424,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"40215022192","name":"Evan Bourne - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Evan-Bourne-WWE-Universe\/40215022192","likes":232877,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150875446157193","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/574747_10150875446157193_2124472757_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent face in the bodybuilding sport long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.\n\nFor many years, he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected Governor, he was appointed executive editor of both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 a year to the Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. The magazine MuscleMag International has a monthly two-page article on him, and refers to him as \"The King\".\n\nOne of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965.[3] He won Mr. Europe the following year, at age 19.[3][12] He would go on to compete in and win many bodybuilding contests, as well as some weightlifting contests, including five Mr. Universe (4 \u2013 NABBA [England], 1 \u2013 IFBB [USA]) wins, and seven Mr. Olympia wins, a record which would stand until Lee Haney won his eighth consecutive Mr. Olympia title in 1991.\n\nCompetition Weight: 240 lbs (top 250 lbs)\n\nOff Season Weight: 260 lbs\n\nStrongmanIn 1967, Schwarzenegger competed in and won the Munich stone-lifting contest, in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds (254 kg\/560 lbs.) is lifted between the legs while standing on two foot rests.\n\nMr. OlympiaSchwarzenegger's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, which meant becoming Mr. Olympia.[3][12] His first attempt was in 1969, when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva. However, Schwarzenegger came back in 1970 and won the competition, making him the youngest ever Mr. Olympia at the age of 23, a record he holds to this day.[12]\n\nHe continued his winning streak in the 1971\u20131974 competitions.[12] In 1975, Schwarzenegger was once again in top form, and won the title for the sixth consecutive time,[12] beating Franco Columbu. After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding.[12]\n\nMonths before the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest, filmmakers George Butler and Robert Fiore persuaded Schwarzenegger to compete, in order to film his training in the bodybuilding documentary called Pumping Iron. Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition, after losing significant weight to appear in the film Stay Hungry with Jeff Bridges. Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat, and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia.\n\nSchwarzenegger came out of retirement, however, to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia.[3] Schwarzenegger was training for his role in Conan, and he got into such good shape because of the running, horseback riding and sword training, that he decided he wanted to win the Mr. Olympia contest one last time. He kept this plan a secret, in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face. Schwarzenegger had been hired to provide color commentary for network television, when he announced at the eleventh hour that while he was there: \"Why not compete?\" Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation. After being declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time, Schwarzenegger officially retired from competition.","bio":"When I'm pumping my guns, in complete concentration and I get distracted when someone shouts to me \"Hey Arnold!\".","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"personal_info":"What is bodybuilding?\n\nIt's not lifting weights, its not dieting, it's not steroids.

{"about":"The official Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Tyson Kidd.","affiliation":"WWE","bio":"No matter where his promising WWE career takes him, Tyson Kidd will always have Hart.\n\nKidd has that legendary surname to thank for grooming him into an up-and-coming WWE Superstar. Hailing from the same stomping grounds in Calgary, Alberta, as the Hart clan, Kidd trained under the family patriarch Stu Hart at the influential Dungeon, then later under the personal guidance of WWE Hall of Famer Bret \u201cHit Man\u201d Hart.\n\nTo pay tribute to the famous family that took him under their wing, Kidd donned the pink and black with David Hart Smith and Natayla to form The Hart Dynasty, reinvigorating the WWE tag team ranks with the a pulsing spirit not unlike The Hart Foundation decades earlier. The successful pairing showed their guts by coming to the aid of Bret Hart in his match against WWE Chairman Mr. McMahon at WrestleMania XXVI. \u201cHit Man\u201d repaid the favor one month later by supporting The Hart Dynasty at ringside as they won the Unified Tag Team Championship from Big Show & The Miz in April 2010.\n\nThough Kidd spent time honing his craft as solo Superstar following the split of The Hart Dynasty, the former \u201cStampede Kid\u201d had no trouble stealing the show in the singles ranks. Although he was unsuccessful, it can be argued Kidd was the breakout star of the 2012 World Heavyweight Title Contract Money in the Bank Ladder Match.\n\nIn late December, the hiccup-quick aerial artist was dealt a severe setback when he hyperextended his knee and suffered several injuries (ligament and meniscus tears in his right knee and a fracture in his tibia plateau). With the subsequent surgery declared a success, doctors have estimated Kidd will require seven to nine months of recovery time, but the former WWE Tag Team Champion says he is aiming for six months on the mend.\n\nWhen the last graduate of the fabled Hart Dungeon is cleared to return, success certainly won\u2019t be far off on the horizon.","category":"Athlete","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Calgary","state":"AB","country":"Canada","zip":""},"talking_about_count":798,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"71312021102","name":"Tyson Kidd - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Tyson-Kidd-WWE-Universe\/71312021102","likes":172257,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150782875221103","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/539571_10150782875221103_516065919_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Then, on the April 20 edition of SmackDown, General Manager John Laurinaitis formally placed Darren Young and his newfound ally Titus O\u2019Neil on the SmackDown roster.\n\nTaking on the name of The Prime Time Players, Young and O\u2019Neil are ready to prove to the WWE Universe that they\u2019re worth the \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d they says they are. It seemed as if they were prepared to do just that, emphatically winning a Triple Threat Tag Team Match on the Sept. 7 SmackDown to earn the No. 1 contendership to the WWE Tag Team Titles.\n\nTheir chance at the championships went up in smoke the following Monday, when they were forced to put their title opportunity on the line against the impromptu pair of Kane and Daniel Bryan. Their furious foes emerged victorious, leaving The Prime Time Players hungry for another opportunity.\n\nYoung and O\u2019Neil showed that hunger on the Sept. 17 Raw. They viciously attacked Rey Mysterio and Sin Cara after the masked marvels\u2019 match, before declaring that nothing was going to be taken from them anymore. The Prime Time Players declared that, from now on, they\u2019ll be taking what they want, when they want.\n\nAfter being upset by Mysterio and Sin Cara in a tournament to determine the No. 1 contenders to the WWE Tag Team Titles, O\u2019Neil and Young set out for retribution against the masked marvels. They finally got one up on their rivals on SuperSmackDown LIVE in Birmingham, England. Picking up the win, The Prime Time Players instantly declared that their victory would be worth millions of dollars.\n\nYoung and O'Neil attempted to make a statement on the Nov. 19 edition of Raw, interrupting a match between WWE Tag Team Champions Team Hell No and Mysterio & Sin Cara. Their attack backfired, as the two teams launched a counter attack that culminated with a double 619 on The Prime Time Players.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling what Titus O\u2019Neil and Darren Young will do to get what they feel is rightfully theirs: the WWE Tag Team Titles.","category":"Athlete","company_overview":"Stats:\nHeight: 6 foot 1\nWeight: 240 pounds\nFrom: Miami, FL","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Miami","state":"FL","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":1566,"website":"http:\/\/www.wwe.com\/superstars","were_here_count":0,"id":"321466494134","name":"Darren Young - WWE Universe","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Darren-Young-WWE-Universe\/321466494134","likes":255887,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151668093614135","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1385413_10151668093614135_1951013254_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

The nickname JJ was given to him by his twin older sisters Alyssa and Catie. At a young age, JJ moved to Roanoke, Virginia, where he was home-schooled with the rest of his siblings. In 5th grade, JJ switched to public school where his basketball skills were quickly noticed on the playground. As a child, JJ could usually be found shooting hoops at the basket that stood at the end of his driveway. JJ\u2019s jumper was well known around Roanoke, but when JJ started his high school career at Cave Spring High School, he began receiving national attention.\n\nHe averaged 20 points a game in his freshman and sophomore years, making him one of the most sought after recruits in the country. Ever since watching the Blue Devils win their consecutive championships in 1991 and 1992, JJ dreamed of playing at Duke for Coach K. Despite attempts by many of the nation\u2019s top colleges, JJ committed to Duke before his junior year. He was a participant in the McDonald\u2019s All-American game, where he won MVP of the game as well as the 3-point contest. JJ was named Virginia\u2019s Player of the Year and led his Cave Spring team to the 2002 AAA State Championship, scoring a career high 43 points in the final game. He also won two national championships with his AAU team during this time. \n\nJJ arrived at Duke with loads of hype and expectations, and it didn\u2019t take him long to make an impact during his freshman year. He averaged 15 points a game and finished second for ACC Freshman of the Year honors. In his sophomore year, JJ led the Blue Devils in scoring during a memorable season that was highlighted by an ACC record streak of 54-straight made free throws. That year\u2019s team made it to the Final Four, but failed to venture any further. In his junior year, JJ was named an All-American, was the ACC Player of the Year, and won the Rupp National Player of the Year Award. He led both the Blue Devils and the ACC in scoring that season, averaging over 21 points a game. JJ also won the ACC Tournament MVP by scoring over 25 points per game en route to the tournament title. \n\nAfter his junior year, JJ elected to stay in school for his senior season and to finish his education. The decision to stay for his senior year was a good one as JJ set numerous records and received many prestigious awards. During his final year at Duke, JJ set the records for most points scored in ACC history, highest free-throw percentage in ACC history, most points in a single season in Duke history, and most points in ACC tournament history. He also broke the NCAA record for most 3 pointers made on his way to winning the Wooden, Naismith, and Rupp awards for the College Basketball Player of the Year.\n\nAfter graduating from Duke University, JJ took his talents to the NBA where he was drafted 11th in the 2006 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic. JJ\u2019s rookie year was full of ups and downs. He helped the Magic reach the playoffs; however, they were quickly defeated by the Detroit Pistons. JJ participated in the summer league and got to play with some of the best players in the world at the US National Team practices. During the 2007-2008 season, JJ was motivated and ready to build off of his rookie season and help the Magic go deeper into the playoffs. The Magic defeated the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the playoffs before losing to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals. During the offseason, JJ trimmed his body fat, increased his strength, and increased his lateral quickness. Magic Coach Stan Van Gundy has taken notice and predicts that JJ will have an even larger impact on the Magic in the 2008-2009 season.","talking_about_count":179,"username":"jjredick","website":"http:\/\/www.redicklive.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"43651623844","name":"J.J.

Originally an attacker, he primarily plays as a left-back and is described as \"the classic example of a modern full-back\" who is renowned for his \"pace, athleticism, and determination\". Evra \"offers a genuine attacking outlet down the left\" and is also \"strong in the air\" despite his noticeably small frame. Evra, whom Sir Alex Ferguson praised for his leadership, has served as captain for both Manchester United and France.The son of a diplomat, Evra was born in Senegal and arrived in Europe when he was a year old. He was raised in France and began his football career playing for various clubs in the \u00cele-de-France region such as hometown club CO Les Ulis and CSF Br\u00e9tigny. In 1997, he had a stint at professional club Paris Saint-Germain. A year later, Evra seized his first footballing opportunity in neighbouring Italy when he signed his first professional contract with Marsala in Sicily. He made his professional debut with the club and, in the ensuing season, joined Monza. After a year playing with Monza, Evra returned to France to play for Nice. Originally a midfielder, while playing at Nice, he was converted into a full-back.
