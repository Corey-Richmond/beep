{"about":"Night Visions DLX is NOW available: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/NightVisionsDLX","band_interests":"Smiling people.","band_members":"Dan Reynolds (Vox), D. Wayne Sermon (Guitar), Daniel \"Z\" Platzman (Drums),  Ben McKee (Bass)","bio":"After the last note played on the last song of a marathon set a few years ago, Dan\nReynolds, frontman for Las Vegas based rockers Imagine Dragons, realized it was all\nstarting to come together. \u201cWe were playing a gig at this place called O\u2019Sheas, which\nhas the cheapest beer on the strip,\u201d Reynolds remembers. \u201cI was basically standing\non top of the drums, the stage was so small. We were on our final song of a six-hour\nset. I got to the end of the song and just fully passed out in the middle of singing.\nI came to, got up, finished the song, and we got a standing ovation from all these\npeople at this tiny little casino at three am on a weekday in Vegas. Something about\nthat moment bonded us and made us realize that we were building a connection\nwith people from all over the country.\u201d\n\nSince then that connection has only grown. Reynolds and his bandmates \u2013 guitarist\nWayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman \u2013 independently\nreleased three EPs, toured extensively, and racked up numerous best-of-Vegas\nawards. Then, earlier this year, the band made their major label debut with the\nrelease of their Continued Silence EP available on Grammy award winning producer\nAlex Da Kid\u2019s (Eminem, Rihanna) label, KIDinaKORNER. From the epic slow-\nburn throb of \u201cRadioactive\u201d to the upbeat percussive intimacy of \u201cOn Top of the\nWorld\u201d to the delicate blend of acoustic guitar and synthetic pop on \u201cRound and\nRound,\u201d the collection showcases Imagine Dragons\u2019 signature diversity of sound\nand sentiment. \u201cIt\u2019s Time,\u201d the EP\u2019s anthemic, emotionally bare, foot-stomping lead\nsingle has become Imagine Dragon\u2019s calling card. And it\u2019s the song that sets the tone\nfor what\u2019s to come as the band prepares to enter the studio this summer to record\ntheir full-length debut with Alex Da Kid.\n\n\u201cI wrote \u2018It\u2019s Time\u2019 during a very transitional period in my life,\u201d Reynolds recalls. \u201cIt\nseemed like everything was going wrong. I was trying to decide what I wanted to do\nwith my life, trying to figure out how seriously to take music. I was making decisions\nabout who I was. I\u2019m a pretty young guy and I\u2019m still trying to figure out the answer\nto those questions. But I wrote that song just standing my kitchen stomping my feet\nand clapping my hands. I wasn\u2019t thinking about writing a great song, I was thinking\nabout what was important to me\u2014about wanting to stay true to your roots but also\nnot be afraid to go outside your boundaries.\u201d\n\nThat balance between riding steady and risking it all is the core tension at the heart\nof Imagine Dragons\u2019 sound and identity, and it\u2019s a reflection of the city they call\nhome. \u201cOur band wouldn\u2019t exist without Las Vegas,\u201d Reynolds says simply. \u201cIt\u2019s\na great place for an artist to start out.\u201d Sin City isn\u2019t known as a creative hotbed\nbut, weirdly, that works to the advantage of the musicians who live there. \u201cIt\u2019s not\noversaturated,\u201d he explains. \u201cAs a new band you play the casinos - half covers, half\nyour own stuff \u2013 and you make ends meet. We were able to buy a band house and\nsupport ourselves. Eating ramen, but still.\u201d Eking out a living as a Vegas rocker\nmight be relatively easy, but competition is cutthroat because the city is like boot\ncamp for performers. Unlike in New York or LA where your biggest concern is being\nthe hottest rock act around, in Las Vegas you\u2019ve got to compete with showgirls\n\nand roulette and Cher at the Caesars Palace. \u201cYou learn to stand out because\nyou\u2019re competing for the attention of people sitting at slot machines,\u201d Reynolds\nexplains. \u201cYou have to bring everything you have and learn what grabs people\u2019s\nattention enough that they look up from the card table and say, hey, let\u2019s check this\nout!\u201d\n\nFor Imagine Dragons that means a blend of hip-hop influenced backbeats layered\nunder thrillingly direct guitar, bass, and drums. \u201cWe like making raw natural noises\nand keeping them raw and natural but transforming them into synthetic noises,\u201d\nSermon says. \u201cWe are gearheads. We do a lot of experimenting with percussion\nthat\u2019s electric and acoustic on top of each other.\u201d Every band member except\nReynolds attended Boston\u2019s prestigious Berklee College of Music, and the technical\nskill and precision that comes with that education has impacted Imagine Dragons\u2019\nsound and process. \u201cI\u2019m a musician that goes by ear. And when you put those two\ntypes of people in a room together that\u2019s when the magic happens,\u201d say Reynolds.\n\nIn a world where any teenager with a webcam can become a rock star then a has-\nbeen all in the space of a few months, Imagine Dragons are a refreshing return to\nthe tried-and-true traditions of great rock and roll. They\u2019ve learned how to be a\nband the old fashioned way, by writing great songs and playing them live to an\nincreasingly large audience. But their secret weapon is the one element we\u2019ve\ntruly lost in this exhibitionistic post-internet music culture: mystery. \u201cThe name\nof the band is an anagram,\u201d Wayne says. \u201cWe had this phrase but it was something\nwe didn\u2019t really want to call the band so we agreed to switch the letters around\nand came up with Imagine Dragons. We haven\u2019t even told our own mothers what\nthe phrase was. As an artist you put so much of yourself out there it\u2019s fun to have\nsomething you keep to yourself.\u201d","booking_agent":"Corrie Christopher, Paradigm, cchristopher\u0040paradigmagency.com, Europe\/UK: James Whitting, Coda Agency, james\u0040codaagency.com","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Mac Reynolds, mac\u0040reynoldsmgmt.com","genre":"Alternative Rock","hometown":"Las Vegas","influences":"People smiling.","is_published":true,"press_contact":"U.S.:  Hillary.Siskind\u0040umusic.com           \/\/\/\/\/\/           International:  Nick.Miller\u0040umusic.com","talking_about_count":161740,"username":"ImagineDragons","website":"http:\/\/www.imaginedragonsmusic.com http:\/\/twitter.com\/imaginedragons http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/ImagineDragons","were_here_count":0,"id":"39643821406","name":"Imagine Dragons","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ImagineDragons","likes":3231219,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151942158476407","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1375097_10151942158476407_1895795838_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"\"The Sons\" www.mumfordandsons.com. ","band_members":"Ted Dwane  \nBen Lovett  \nMarcus Mumford\nCountry Winston  ","bio":"\u201cWe wanted to do something unashamed,\u201d says Ben Lovett. \u201cWe\u2019re confident and happy to be where we are as a band \u2014 everything that\u2019s happened with us has exceeded expectations, and it\u2019s all been a surprise, it\u2019s all much bigger than what we were prepared for. So when we came to recording this record we had a choice: to shy away from that, or to realise that people dig what we\u2019re doing, and make something robust, with that energy.\u201d\n\nIt was December 2010, and Mumford and Sons had been on the road since the previous summer: a glorious, eventful, yet relentless time. Standing somewhere between exhilarated and exhausted, the plan now was for the band\u2019s four members to spend a few weeks apart, write, recuperate, and then reconvene in Nashville in the New Year, with the intention of trying out material for their second album.\n\nThe informality of the set-up in Tennessee perhaps helped to dispel any nerves they may have had about following up 2009\u2019s Sigh No More \u2014 an album that had gone four times platinum in the UK, and twice platinum in the US. The band assembled in the front room of a house and set about sharing the songs they had been working on alone. \u201cIt was a coming together, a sharing of some stuff,\u201d explains Lovett (keys, accordion, drums), \u201ca pool of ideas that would come out of our time apart. So if there was nervousness, it wasn\u2019t nervousness about the record, it was nervousness about how a couple of these new song ideas would go down. But we knew we were going to play music, and it wasn\u2019t time to get into the nuts and bolts of it, it was more like we were starting another year from this point. And that felt very good. Very fresh, and natural.\u201d\n\nOut of that time in Nashville came a couple of songs for the new record \u2014 the gorgeous Lovers\u2019 Eyes and Hopeless Wanderer. Then followed more touring, performances at the Grammys and the Brits, before the chance came in the summer to head into a studio in Bermondsey, south London. Here the band recorded the title song for the soundtrack to Wuthering Heights, as well as finding the footings for several of the new album\u2019s songs: Babel, I Will Wait, Not With Haste, Broken Crown, Lover of the Light. \u201cAnd then,\u201d recalls Marcus Mumford (lead vocals, guitar, drums), \u201cwe went down to a farm in Somerset and played the 10 song game, which is where you have to write 10 songs each in a set period of time without any criteria for quality.\u201d The result of the 10 song game, the band recall with some amusement, was firstly that Ted Dwane (string bass, drums, guitar) has a natural propensity for writing murder ballads, and secondly a new album track named Reminder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a nice exercise because it removes your focus on perfection,\u201d says Dwane. \u201cYou drop your guard down and you sort of bash about.\u201d For Mumford, it also helped to re-focus to the material already amassed. \u201cThere were various points in the album where we felt maybe we needed to inject more directness, and maybe that\u2019s what Reminder did,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit more obscurity in this album and Reminder is a really emotionally identifiable song. I think I Will Wait Was the Same. And in terms of making the best record we could we felt like we needed those songs.\u201d\n\n2011 took shape slowly \u2014 throughout that year they were establishing the album\u2019s \u201ccornerstone songs\u201d, discussing the new material with producer Markus Dravs \u2014 who had also steered Sigh No More (\u201cHe\u2019s like a mind master,\u201d says Lovett) and engineer Robin Baynton (\u201cHe has the best ears,\u201d says Mumford \u201cbut he\u2019ll never sacrifice vibe for accuracy\u201d) finding more writing and studio time wherever their schedule would allow. But more importantly they were trying to work out just what kind of record they were making. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us had any idea then about what we were trying to do,\u201d says Lovett, frankly. \u201cWe had a body of songs and we just really wanted to record them. And we thought that was all you needed. But we learned that wasn\u2019t quite the case.\u201d\n\nShortly before Christmas, they decided to stand back and take stock of what they had, heading down to Lovett\u2019s parents\u2019 home in Devon for a review of the new material. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really where we had the vision for the album,\u201d says Mumford, \u201cor where it solidified.\u201d \u201cWe were suddenly really confident and happy with what we were making,\u201d adds Dwane. \u201cWe were all on-site, all pistols firing. I think the album started to assert its own identity a little bit, it started to make sense, and we knew then what we were making.\u201d\n\nBabel\u2019s identity Dwane describes as simply \u201cVery us. When we made the first album it was to be a snapshot of Mumford & Sons in 2009. This is exactly the same \u2014 but it\u2019s us now, and there\u2019s a lot of the live energy in there \u2014 that was very much what we were trying to capture. Creating the album over the course of a year, going into the studio then back out touring, then back into the studio \u2026 it\u2019s almost as if the road has rubbed off on the album.\u201d\n\nThe influence of the phenomenal live band Mumford and Sons have become is much in evidence on Babel, from the fire and fury of the title track to the keen and tender yearning of the album\u2019s closer, Not With Haste. \u201cI think over the past few years we\u2019ve realised how much we have to play the songs that we\u2019ve recorded,\u201d says Mumford. \u201cSo we thought harder about these songs, feeling confident that we could play them again and again and again, and that however you record a song gives it its own life.\u201d\n\nAs a result, several songs on Babel were recorded live. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a room with headphones and microphones and no one else, you play it quite differently to how you play it live,\u201d says Mumford. \u201cHaving played live as much as we have these past five years, it\u2019s probably made us a bit more high-octane, a bit more adrenaline-filled, but because of that we probably also need to counter it more. But we really wanted to allow permission for quiet songs on the album, so that we could allow permission for them live as well.\u201d\n\nMore than anything, there is a real a sense of completeness to Babel, a satisfying wholeness and a kind of musical and lyrical wealth \u2014 romanticism tempered by strength and vigour; a brawniness balanced by beauty. \u201cI think there\u2019s more subject-matter on this album, and I think we\u2019ve grown up a little bit,\u201d says Mumford. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s more exposed, more naked. Ted always talked about wanting to make an album like a story,\u201d he adds. \u201cNot necessarily one that has a plot, but one that you can listen from top to bottom and it makes sense. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to do, and what we\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nWinston concludes, \u201cAnd now we\u2019ve finished it we can get touring again, which is what we set out to do when we started the band. Back to business.\u201d","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"London","genre":"Folk and Roll","hometown":"London","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":19937,"username":"mumfordandsons","website":"http:\/\/www.mumfordandsons.com\/ https:\/\/twitter.com\/MumfordAndSons www.myspace.com\/mumfordandsons http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/mumfordandsons http:\/\/www.gentlemenoftheroad.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"35370633792","name":"Mumford and Sons","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mumfordandsons","likes":4857962,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151401625423793","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/559031_10151401625423793_921068535_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

It is an afternoon shindig hosted by the blog Brooklyn Vegan, at the 2009 South by Southwest festival. The sun is setting and it is a classic make-it-or-break-it moment for Passion Pit, who is headlining despite having just released a lone EP, Chunk of Change. The crowd is giddy on both free Izze fruit soda and the Boston band\u2019s bubbly pop. Between songs, frontman Michael Angelakos runs his fingers and sweat through his thick, curly, Greek hair. He starts to rant\u2014about a shirt he bought for his new girlfriend, about veganism, about inane blog comments. After a few awkward minutes, the music kicks back in. By the end of the performance, Michael is rolling on a red Persian rug amongst many, many keyboard and effects pedal cables, clutching his microphone, wailing in his signature helium falsetto. The audience cheers, the Tweeters tweet, the bloggers blog ecstatically. \n\nMichael leaves the stage and begins crying. He has made it, and he has broken.\n\nWhen the festival ends, the rest of the Passion Pit guys van back to Massachusetts. Michael stays behind in Texas. He calls a friend for support and begs her to come be with him. In a panic, he buys her a plane ticket. It is for the wrong year, 2010. He calls his parents in Buffalo, New York. \u201cI\u2019m going to a hospital,\u201d he tells them.\n\nMichael is standing with his father outside a hospital in Houston, looking at mock-ups of album artwork on his cellphone. Passion Pit has just signed to Columbia Records, and a debut album, Manners, is due in a couple months. The record cover is green and messy and murky. Michael is not crazy about it, but there is no time, as the hospital is about to take his phone away from him. \u201cIt looks fine, Michael,\u201d his dad says. \u201cJust go.\u201d\n\nIn the hospital, Michael is not allowed to talk about work. \u201cUp there, onstage, you\u2019re alone, darling, \u201d a nurse tells him. \u201cAnd if your life evolves into ruin, everyone will watch what you're doing.\u201d Michael thinks these would make good lyrics. His friends smuggle in positive reviews of Manners. When one magazine blesses the record with an 8 out of ten, he almost cries again.\n\n-------------------\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll Be Alright\u201d\n\nThis first sentence was not always the first. Originally, I was going to start with a simile: Michael Angelakos\u2019 brain is like a shaken can of spray paint with no nozzle. Millions of particles of bright ideas bounce around in there. When inspiration punctures his head, art sprays out. Often, someone else must puncture the can, or smash it. Only, if you hold Michael\u2019s bursting skull up to a canvas, you would not get a cloudy splatter of dripping bits. The paint would land perfectly in a detailed map of the knotty Tokyo subway system.\n\nYou can hear this \u201cI\u2019ll Be Alright,\u201d the second song on Gossamer, in which a sudden seizure of skittering programmed drums swarms over diced synths. \u201cMy brain is racing and I feel like I\u2019ll explode!\u201d Michael sings amidst the orchestral glitch. He compares it to the sensation you feel after an orgasm.\n\nWriting about creativity is like architecturing about dance. When I sat down to describe Michael\u2019s thought process, a can of paint formed in my mind for whatever reason. After that, I thought no nozzle, because I like the alliteration. Then I tacked on a subject and verb. I start with a phrase, an image or a rhythm of words and construct around it. I\u2019m not a beginning-to-end sentence builder. Michael asked me to write this piece because he intuited, correctly, that my writing is akin to his song crafting.\n\nA spark of a Passion Pit song might be found in the fuzz of a guitar pedal. It might be a stumbled-upon drum loop, the tintinnabulation of layered chimes or some gibberish harmony he\u2019s humming. It might be one of the 200 scratch melodies Michael has stored on his iPhone. Later, Michael might sit at a keyboard and work out a melody. \u201cI do things backwards,\u201d he admits, \u201cand I\u2019m a maximalist.\u201d Indeed. The songs on Gossamer carry anywhere from 60 to 200 instrumental tracks, according to Michael. If you ask Alex Aldi, Michael\u2019s engineer, they number 80 to 120. (The maximum output on their version of ProTools is 120 tracks.) Whatever, it\u2019s a fuckton. But it\u2019s important to talk to Alex.\n\n-------------------\n\u201cConstant Conversations\u201d\n\nWhen Alex and Michael set forth to record Gossamer in January of 2011, the two first rented a studio near the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn\u2019s DUMBO neighborhood. Well, it was technically an office space. The new Passion Pit headquarters shared the building with digital media start-ups, dot.coms, that sort of thing, which were not appreciative of gut-rumbling bass bumps rattling the uninsulated walls. \n\n\u201cWe'd blast these huge R. Kelly\u2013like booms,\u201d Michael says. \u201cThere would be fists pounding the walls,\u201d Alex remembers. \n\nThe duo began working from 6PM to 6AM, partly to avoid pissing off the neighbors, partly because Michael is \u201creally OCD about who\u2019s hearing me\u201d In the wee hours, Michael would toil at his array of keyboards, sequencers and computers. \n\nThe fruit of this first stage is the stunning slow jam \u201cConstant Conversations.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of stank-faced, flesh-slapping R&B groove that makes a name like \u201cPassion Pit\u201d sound positively filthy. That is, until you pay attention to the lyrics. They are not nocturnal; they are dark. \u201cI'm drunker than before \/ They told me drinking doesn't make me nice,\u201d Michael sings. \u201cWell, you're standing in the kitchen and you\u2019re pouring out my drink.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s important to pay attention to the lyrics.\n-------------------\n\u201cSlip-ups in this town are like a sentence to life.\u201d \n\u2013\u201cMirrored Sea\u201d\nWhat makes Southern California\u2019s orange sherbet sunsets so gorgeous? It\u2019s the life-strangling smog. Toxic clouds can sometimes lead to beauty. \n\nIn June of 2011, Michael headed to L.A. to continue work on Gossamer with a variety of big name producers. One producer would bring in pretty girls to sit on a couch in the studio. He would play back tracks at top volume. If the girls got up and danced, it was a hit. \n\nMichael slept in another studio beneath the control room, where he could hear some dude fucking people\u2019s brains out all night. The walls were marble. \n\nMichael slept where Fiona Apple once slept. Michael recorded in a fancy house outside of which photographers snapped models in lingerie. Michael worked with a prominent hip-hop producer. They tinkered with \u201cHideaway,\u201d an upbeat tune set to a speech a nurse once gave him. Michael played the hip-hop producer his demo. \u201cYou don\u2019t need anyone to produce you,\u201d the producer humbly admitted. Michael flew back to Brooklyn, ending what he now calls his \u201cJune gloom.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone let\u2019s me make these mistakes,\u201d Michael says.\n-------------------\n\u201cCarried Away\u201d\n\n\u201cHe plays music so loud in his headphones, I can hear everything he\u2019s doing. When he's working, he won\u2019t get up to use the bathroom or to take a sip of water. Watching him is watching someone in their element, someone doing what they were born to do. But it can be a waiting game for him to get an idea. Then, bam, ninety minutes later there\u2019s this amazing finished song. He does stuff on the fly. Michael thrives on that, the immediate pressure.  Everyone else game-plans. The game-plan is in Michael\u2019s head and he\u2019s twenty steps ahead. Conveying that is difficult. It\u2019s information overload.\u2019\u201d \u2014 engineer Alex Aldi\n-------------------\n\u201cIt\u2019s Not My Fault, I\u2019m Happy\u201d\n\nAside from the sarcastic \u201cLove Is Greed,\u201d all the songs on Gossamer are one-hundred-percent true. I know this because I\u2019ve compared the lyric sheet to a 3,672 word life story Michael emailed me. It begins, \u201cA main talking point seems to be about the fact that there is a dichotomy in my music.\u201d It ends with, \u201cThe next day I quit drinking.\u201d I read it one evening while listening to \u201cIt\u2019s Not My Fault I\u2019m Happy\u201d repeatedly as tears welled in my eyes.\n\nUnlike some songwriters, Michael does not write in character. He compares the album to a collection of John Cheever stories. \u201cIt\u2019s non-fiction, but dramatized. It\u2019s euphoric pain,\u201d he tells me. \n\nThe record is more intimate than that. Listening and reading along, I feel as if I am reading his chart. I am eavesdropping. I am putting him inside one of the TSA\u2019s full-body millimeter wave scanners. \n\nAh, I think, \u201cTake A Walk\u201d must be about his father and his father\u2019s father, his Papou, who sold old roses and owned a candy kitchen, using his savings to bring his village to America.\n\nHearing the celestas and xylophones skittering about the opening of \u201cLove Is Greed,\u201d I envision bolts of blue electricity flashing across Michael\u2019s grey matter. The systolic, panicked pulse of \u201cMirrored Sea\u201d is awash in adrenaline and amphetamine salts. The pomp and silver twinkle of \u201cOn My Way\u201d is confetti for a forthcoming wedding. \n\n\u201cAre you sure you want to be this open,\u201d Alex asked when he first heard the lyrics.\n\n\u201cThis music is so on point with myself, I don\u2019t know that I could do it any other way,\u201d Michael replied.\n\nYes, Michael\u2019s music juxtaposes dark subject matter and ebullient pop. It is at once escape and reality. It is also consciously androgynous. In the past, this was suitably captured with Michael\u2019s falsetto. Now the unisexuality is enhanced by Erato, a female Swedish a cappella trio, two brunettes and one blonde, who went viral with a performance of Robyn\u2019s \u201cCall Your Girlfriend\u201d on empty yogurt cups. Michael likes the idea of us not being able to discern if he or they are singing in certain parts. This is not duality or dichotomy. This is depth and honesty. Human beings are emotional, messy and murky creatures.\n-------------------\n\u201cOn My Way\u201d\n\nIt is a misconception that Manners was written for a girl. It was a record about Michael. Gossamer was written for a couple. \u201cIt\u2019s an album about making an album that\u2019s straining the relationship that\u2019s helping you make that album. But say it better than that,\u201d he tells me.\n\nKristy is an editor for a prominent food website. Her face appears throughout the Gossamer artwork. The back cover is a letter Michael wrote to her. He proposes to her in the chorus of \u201cOn My Way.\u201d Originally the tune was called \u201cBallerina.\u201d \n\n\u201cJust believe in me Kristina,\u201d he sings. \u201cAll these demons, I can beat \u2019em.\u201d\n\n-------------------\n\n\u201cWhere We Belong\u201d\n\nUpon returning to Brooklyn from California, Michael reconnected with producer Chris Zane, who helmed Manners. Here is a sporting analogy, hockey specifically, according to Michael:\n\n\u201cChris is the general manager and Alex is the coach. Without Chris I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do this record. Without Alex I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do anything.\u201d\n\nAlex is ten years Michael's senior, Chris a little older. Michaels refers to them as his older brother and his older, older brother. The trio hunkered down in Gigantic Studios and started over on Gossamer as a mild winter fell upon New York. Michael admits he will often redo songs \u201clike thirteen times. It\u2019s one of my worst habits.\u201d\nManners was largely built on three keyboards. There was a conscious effort this time to avoid the same process, to use more organic ingredients. Composer Nico Muhly dropped in, dueling pianos with Michael on \u201cLove Is Greed\u201d and arranging strings. That being said, there were still dozens of keyboards, walls of keyboards, \u201csome Herbie Hancock shit.\u201d Yamahas, Moogs, Arps, MS-20s, SH-101s, Junos, Prophets, a Japanese piano. They flipped over a couch in the control room to stuff in even more keyboards. Ask Michael to explain the differences between these many keyboards and he synesthetically describes it by texture: \u201cOne is felt, one is 100\u0025 cotton, one is tweed\u2026\u201d\nAlex would watch and listen in a busted La-Z-Boy recliner permanently stuck in the recumbent position. \n\n\u201cI did a calculation of the time I spent on this record. It was 4\u0025 of my life,\u201d Alex tells me. He has recently heard the finished record. We chat about the sequence of the songs and debate the decision to cut a string section that originally opened the album. \u201cIt dawned on me this morning\u201d he says. \u201cAfter having a best friend for thirteen months, Michael is gone. I\u2019m like, what the fuck do I do now?\u201d\n\nWhen I hang up, I must immediately play Gossamer again.\n","booking_agent":"ryan\u0040windishagency.com (US) \/ robzifarelli\u0040theagencygroup.com (Canada) \/ natashabent\u0040theagencygroup.com (UK\/EU) ","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Cambridge, MA","general_manager":"rich\u0040mickmgmt.com","genre":"Pop","hometown":"Cambridge MA","influences":"Our Friends","is_published":true,"press_contact":"nikki.bennett\u0040sonymusic.com ","record_label":"Columbia","talking_about_count":3745,"username":"passionpitofficial","website":"www.passionpitmusic.com  www.twitter.com\/passionpit ","were_here_count":0,"id":"63224190085","name":"Passion Pit","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/passionpitofficial","likes":1242416,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151857676555086","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/971059_10151857676555086_645296007_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Get 'Mechanical Bull' on iTunes now - http:\/\/smarturl.it\/MechanicalBull?iqid=fb\n","band_members":"Caleb Followill - lead vocals, rhythm guitar \nJared Followill - bass\nMatthew Followill - lead guitar\nNathan Followill - drums ","bio":"When Kings of Leon released their third album Because Of The Times in April 2007, Entertainment Weekly called it their \u201ccrowning achievement,\u201d while Rolling Stone wondered: \u201cHow good can the Kings of Leon get? They\u2019ve already gone further than anybody could have guessed.\u201d  \n\nComing as it did on the heels of 2003\u2019s rowdy Youth and Young Manhood and 2005\u2019s brawny Aha Shake Heartbreak, the expansive Because of The Times was indeed a pivotal and game-changing album. It led the Followills \u2014 Tennessee-bred Caleb, Nathan, and Jared, and their cousin Matthew \u2014 to astonishing success around the world. In the U.S., the band has sold out New York City\u2019s fabled Radio City Music Hall and The Greek Theatre in Hollywood. In the U.K., Kings of Leon headlined this summer\u2019s legendary Glastonbury Festival, as well as the Oxygen Festival in Ireland, and sold out their upcoming December show at London\u2019s 20,000-seat 02  Arena (where Led Zeppelin held its reunion concert) in less than an hour. \n\nBut if critics thought that Because of The Times was the work of a band \u201cat the peak of its powers\u201d (as the Los Angeles Times put it), they may want to reconsider that assessment after hearing Kings of Leon\u2019s new album Only By The Night, due from RCA Records on September 23rd. Only By The Night picks up where Because of The Times left off, continuing Kings of Leon\u2019s shape-shifting evolution and cementing their status as a world-class rock band.\n\n\u201cAfter three records and touring for five years straight, we knew what we were capable of,\u201d says the band\u2019s drummer Nathan, \u201cwe just had to put our money where our mouths were. We had to take it to the next level. You always want your next record to be better than your last.\u201d Adds frontman and lyricist Caleb: \u201cThere\u2019s never a time that we\u2019ll make a record and won\u2019t attempt to do something better than what came before.\u201d\n\nWith its stunning melodies, ringing guitars, and razor-sharp grooves, Only By The Night delivers on the promise Kings of Leon have shown throughout their career. From the desolate atmospherics of the opening track \u201cCloser\u201d (which Caleb says is about a lovesick vampire) to the emotional intensity of the closing ballad \u201cCold Desert\u201d (\u201cabout a man at the end of his rope who picks himself back up\u201d), Only By The Night is all heart from start to finish. \n\nAlbum highlights include the insistently chugging first single \u201cSex on Fire\u201d (\u201cthere\u2019s always been an element of sex in our music, so I thought I\u2019d just wrap it all up in one song and be done with the sex for the rest of the record,\u201d Caleb jokes), the throbbing, propulsive \u201cCrawl\u201d (about relationships of all kinds and taking them for granted), and the sonically sweeping \u201cUse Somebody,\u201d which Caleb wrote while feeling lonely on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s about being far from home.\u201d Then there\u2019s the soaring uplift of \u201cManhattan,\u201d which is partly about dancing and enjoying life and partly about the struggles of Native Americans. \u201c\u2019Manhattan\u2019 is actually a Native American word that means \u2018island of many hills,\u2019\u201d says Caleb, who adds that his family has Native American blood. Finally there\u2019s the driving, forceful \u201cNotion,\u201d which finds the singer pushing back against anyone who says anything against anyone in his band. \n\nCaleb\u2019s instinct for insularity is not surprising given that the band is made up of family members. The familial vibe extended to the recording process when Kings of Leon returned to Nashville\u2019s Blackbird Studio in April 2008 with their long-time producer Angelo Petraglia and Nashville-based producer\/engineer Jacquire King, who also mixed Aha Shake Heartbreak. \u201cAngelo keeps it fun and youthful,\u201d Nathan says. \u201cHe and Jacquire were cool enough to tell us when we really needed to stop playing Wall Ball and get serious, rather than being stern and scaring the shit out of us. It kind of took the pressure off.\u201d \n\nPetraglia and King also encouraged the experimental process the Followills first engaged in when making Because Of The Times, giving the band the freedom to explore all of their ideas. \u201cWe had the opportunity to really get in there and be more hands-on as far as the production goes,\u201d Caleb says. \u201cWe wanted to prove ourselves a bit more. We got to kick our heels up, have drinks, and relax while recording.\u201d Adds Nathan: \u201cYou can tell from the music that we\u2019re definitely comfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me it sounds like the Kings of Leon are back not only as a band, but as friends,\u201d Caleb says. \u201cEvery night after recording we\u2019d go to a bar together, hang out and talk about what we were going to do the next day, rather than all of us going to our separate homes. It was really a big family vibe. That\u2019s where the title comes from. It\u2019s also a reference to a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, and it has five syllables, like all of our album titles.\u201d \n\nCaleb had written most of the lyrics and melodies for Only By The Night during some downtime at home recovering from shoulder surgery. \u201cI think the pain pills inspired him a little more than he realized,\u201d Nathan says with a laugh. \u201cHe would play us a song and we\u2019d say, \u2018When did you write that?\u2019 and he\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t really remember writing it. I just woke up with an empty bottle of wine and my songbook open and these words written down.\u2019\u201d Says Caleb: \u201cThose pills can make you feel so nice. I think a lot of the pretty melodies came from that and from me just opening more.\u201d \n\nAnother influence could be their experiences playing arenas, not only in support of Because Of The Times, but while opening for U2 in 2005 and Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam in 2006 and 2008. \u201cWe definitely wanted the songs to sound good in a 15,000-seat venue, but we also wanted them to have the kind of intimacy that would get the point across at a club show for 300 kids,\u201d Nathan says.\n\nOverall, the Followills knew it was time to be honest about their ambitions and prove what they could really do. Caleb, for one, unleashes some of the most righteous, anguished singing he\u2019s ever recorded. \u201cI knew it was a risk for me to go in there and really open up and belt the way that I know that I can; the way that I used to when I was younger,\u201d he says. \u201cI just hid my singing for so long because I was nervous that people would listen to my lyrics, assume I wasn\u2019t intelligent because I\u2019m from Tennessee, and pick me apart, so that\u2019s why I sang the way I did. But going into this, I knew these melodies that we were playing were too beautiful for me to fuck it up. I had to go for it.\u201d \n\n\u201cBasically we got the point where we realized that we can be known as a band that hit it hard for three records and disappeared, or be a band that was smart enough to realize that not very many bands get to make four records, so let\u2019s make the most of this,\u201d Nathan says. \u201cBecause honestly, we were horrible housepainters and that\u2019s what we\u2019d be doing if we weren\u2019t doing this!\u201d  \n","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Nashville, TN","genre":"Rock","is_published":true,"record_label":"RCA Records","talking_about_count":63003,"username":"KingsOfLeon","website":"http:\/\/www.kingsofleon.com\nhttp:\/\/www.myspace.com\/kingsofleon \nhttp:\/\/www.ilike.com\/artist\/Kings+Of+Leon","were_here_count":0,"id":"6174621106","name":"Kings Of Leon","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/KingsOfLeon","likes":11945219,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151859104336107","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1395974_10151859104336107_289010445_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990.\n\nWith the lead single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" from the group's second album Nevermind (1991), Nirvana entered into the mainstream, bringing along with it a subgenre of alternative rock called grunge. Other Seattle grunge bands such as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden also gained popularity, and, as a result, alternative rock became a dominant genre on radio and music television in the United States during the early-to-middle 1990s. As Nirvana's frontman, Kurt Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the \"spokesman of a generation\", with Nirvana the \"flagship band\" of \"Generation X\". Cobain was uncomfortable with the attention and placed his focus on the band's music, challenging the band's audience with its third studio album In Utero (1993).\n\nNirvana's brief run ended with Cobain's death in April 1994, but the band's popularity continued in the years that followed. More than eight years later, \"You Know You're Right\", an unfinished demo from the band's final recording session, topped radio playlists around the world. Since their debut, the band has sold over fifty million albums worldwide. Nirvana are often credited with being one of the most popular and important rock bands of recent years.","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Rock","hometown":"Aberdeen (Washington)","is_published":true,"record_label":"Sub Pop \/ Geffen","talking_about_count":145312,"username":"Nirvana","website":"www.nirvana.com; http:\/\/store.feamerch.com\/nirvana","were_here_count":0,"id":"49436315526","name":"Nirvana","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Nirvana","likes":24394457,"cover":{"cover_id":"10153277493910527","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/994598_10153277493910527_998410670_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Exclusive \"Long Forgotten Songs: B-Sides &\nCovers 2000-2013\" Fan Bundles at http:\/\/smarturl.it\/LFSBundle ","band_members":"Tim\nJoe\nBrandon\nZach","bio":"\n\nDoomsday scenarios are often predictive about an ending in life, revealing just what would occur if the world pushed itself to the brink of extinction. And the term \u201cendgame\u201d typically parallels such thinking, often evoking concepts of finality or termination. \n\nBut for Rise Against, this particular endgame might just be their beginning.\n\nAs the title of the band\u2019s sixth full-length studio album\u2014and the moniker of the album\u2019s title track\u2014Endgame is indicative of both a world that has run its course, and perhaps ushering in an entirely new start.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a dangerous time in civilization, the end of life,\u201d says vocalist\/guitarist Tim McIlrath. \u201cWhat if the life that we\u2019re living right now is this unsustainable bubble that cannot go on and perhaps does not deserve to go on? What if the world we created is a place that is so unnatural and ugly that it is a world that needs to come to an end, so that we could have a world that is better for everybody? It sounds very utopian, but it\u2019s not about a perfect place, but maybe some of these things we\u2019re doing, they need to come to an end.\u201d\n\nMcIlrath, bassist Joe Principe, drummer Brandon Barnes and guitarist Zach Blair have been making these striking personal and political statements, and providing prompts of great magnitude throughout their remarkable catalog by offering songs that aren\u2019t just merely sung, but very much thought about. \n\nAnd it\u2019s thought that has made Rise Against such an important band to its ever-expanding fanbase. For the Chicago-based punk group, the creation of dialogue and discourse with listeners has allowed for a response and career trajectory that\u2019s been overwhelmingly positive since the band\u2019s launch over a decade ago.\n\nRise Against\u2019s previous effort, 2008\u2019s Appeal to Reason, further escalated the noteworthy attention already generated by prior successes, including The Sufferer and the Witness (2006) and Siren Song for the Counterculture (2004), which had provided such hits as \u201cSwing Life Away,\u201d \u201cReady to Fall,\u201d \u201cPrayer of the Refugee\u201d and \u201cSavior.\u201d And Endgame simply picks up on such highlights.\n\nEndgame was largely assembled in the latter half of 2010. The band opted to return to production veterans Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colo., and mixed with Chris Lord-Alge, who also worked on Rise Against\u2019s previous two albums.\n\nThe album\u2019s first single, \u201cHelp Is On The Way\u201d was inspired by McIlrath\u2019s recent visit during a retreat in New Orleans.\n\n\u201cIt was a post-Katrina New Orleans, and I was down at the Gulf, going to the Lower Ninth Ward, seeing the damage and meeting people,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was so eye opening to see how important the city was and to realize that a city like this existed within American borders at all and to see how much it was hurting was something that was really emotional and dramatic.\u201d\n\nMcIlrath notes that the song stems from a lot of that imagery that remains embedded in his thoughts. \n\n\u201cI wanted to paint a picture of what happened down there and what is happening down there, and even though New Orleans is moving away from the spotlight a little bit, there\u2019s still a lot recovery that people don\u2019t see that takes place every day and it\u2019s still an important place in America and in the world. It\u2019s a place that should not be forgotten about. It\u2019s a hopeful title in a sense, but there are a couple different things, as in help is on the way but it never came. It still needs a lot more help, it still needs to happen.\u201d\n\nOn Endgame, Rise Against also shifts the spotlight to homophobia via \u201cMake it Stop,\u201d a topic McIlrath says really hasn\u2019t been addressed in the rock scene. The catalyst for the song occurred in September 2010, after a wave of gay teen suicides. According to McIlrath, the band received e-mails from gay fans who had contemplated suicide due to the harsh climates in which they live and the harsh world that judges who they are.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve seen firsthand,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s bummed me out to create this community of fans, where you want everybody to feel accepted, but then to realize that there are people that don\u2019t feel accepted, even at your own shows, even at a Rise Against show, where we go out of our way to let you know that if you are here, you belong here, no matter who you are. It\u2019s a place where everyone is welcome. But we\u2019d hear from fans about homophobia in the scene, or even hear from fans who are unsure about how Rise Against feels about homosexuality. That was what alarmed me the most, was to have a fan that even had a question in their mind about where we stood on it. I guess I looked back on our career and Rise Against had never made a definitive statement.\u201d\n\nThe definitive statement Rise Against makes on Endgame is that the band is open to any sexual preference. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we certainly don\u2019t judge,\u201d McIlrath says. \u201cI felt there needed to be a song, which came from our world, because I feel that the rock world stays pretty silent. I wanted to put water where the fire was. I wanted to do a song that, first, lets fans know that we don\u2019t tolerate bigotry in our audience and, second, empower fans who are coming to grips with their own sexuality, empower them to be proud of who they are and that we accept them, and create a community that accepts them.\u201d\n\nEndgame also features \u201cArchitect,\u201d a song inspired by the forefathers and historical figures of civil rights and activism, including Thoreau, Malcolm X and Howard Zinn. \n\n\n\u201cThey were designing a world in which we would be able to live in,\u201d McIlrath says. \u201cThey fought for the design of everything that we can enjoy as Americans and people in the world today. The song is posing the question: Is our generation producing those architects now? It\u2019s wondering if our generation is so overcome with cynicism and apathy that we are in danger of not creating these architects. Every right that we enjoy as Americans, somebody was out there with a picket sign to get it.\u201d\n\nAnd McIlrath sees Endgame\u2019s \u201cSurvivor Guilt\u201d as a sequel to \u201cHero of War,\u201d which appeared on Appeal to Reason, hailing from the perspective of a ghost of a soldier who fought for his or her country.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to note that the spectrum of material presented on Endgame is counterbalanced with a number of personal subjects, including the song \u201cThis Is Letting Go\u201d which is based around a story McIlrath had penned.\n\n\u201cThe songs to me are a selection of who we are as people,\u201d says McIlrath. \u201cWe\u2019re not 100 percent political or 100 percent personal. We\u2019re people with many different cares and passions. Many different things make up our daily lives. I don\u2019t consider myself any more political than those out there who care about the world they live in.\u201d\n\nAnd as for the pressure in following up its string of successes\u2014which now includes three gold-awarded albums and gold singles\u2014McIlrath says it\u2019s all internally generated.\n\n\u201cThe pressure that we feel is the pressure that we put on ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cWe try to step up our game on each record and create something that\u2019s relevant, new and fresh, and is still Rise Against. I want to give my perspective, and from the punk community, take in what\u2019s happening, interpret that and put it into a song, letting the world know how we feel about it. That\u2019s the goal behind a lot of the music.\u201d \n","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Chicago, IL","genre":"Punk Rock","hometown":"Chicago","is_published":true,"record_label":"DGC\/Interscope","talking_about_count":11600,"username":"riseagainst","website":"www.riseagainst.com\nwww.myspace.com\/riseagainst\nwww.twitter.com\/riseagainst","were_here_count":0,"id":"43541175704","name":"Rise Against","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/riseagainst","likes":4107247,"cover":{"cover_id":"10153207511235705","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1185719_10153207511235705_121097692_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"FOLLOW ME ON TWITTER : http:\/\/twitter.com\/davidguetta","band_members":"David Guetta","bio":"With 2009\u2019s multi-platinum One Love, two-time-Grammy-winning artist\/producer\/DJ David Guetta cemented his status as a genre-busting hitmaker whose in-your-face fusion of electro and hip-hop beautifully warps the pop landscape. Now, with his fifth studio album Nothing But The Beat, Guetta builds on that breakthrough momentum and takes his decades-spanning career to a frenetic new level marked by bigger hooks and more brain-bending beats. A star- packed powerhouse showcasing today\u2019s hottest hip-hop and R&B artists, Nothing But The Beat backs up its high-gloss pop with ingenious electronic stylings that deftly flaunt Guetta\u2019s DJ pedigree. In a nod to the driving force behind Guetta\u2019s crossover success, the double album (due out August 29) also offers an all-instrumental disc designed to turn new listeners on to the hypnotic sound of house music.\n\nOne of the most wildly anticipated albums of the year, Nothing But The Beat comes hot on the heels of the rush release of its first smash single, \u201cWhere Them Girls At\u201d (featuring Flo Rida & Nicki Minaj). Already his fasting selling single to reach gold status in the USA, the dizzying and deadly catchy \u201cWhere Them Girls At\u201d marks a one-time return to the straight-up club-anthem sensibility of Guetta\u2019s \u201cSexy Bitch\u201d (the 2009 monster hit that moved 5 million units worldwide). \u201cWhen I listen to the radio in the U.S., every song sounds like \u2018Sexy Bitch,\u2019\u201d says Guetta. \u201cThe urban dance thing has become huge. Now I have to push it because my sound has become so popular. It\u2019s a challenge, but I like that.\u201d\n\nFor help in blowing up those musical boundaries, Guetta assembled an A-team of collaborators sure to thrill enthusiasts from all ends of the pop spectrum. Nothing But The Beat features no fewer than 17 guest artists, from hip-hop royalty (Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, Timbaland) and game-changing rappers (Minaj, Lil Wayne) to R&B superstars (Usher, Chris Brown, Akon) and breakout pop acts (Dev, Jessie J). Rounded out by Jennifer Hudson, Flo Rida, Taio Cruz, Sia, and Guetta\u2019s \u201cfellow mad scientist\u201d Will.I.Am., that roster was carefully culled to guarantee a filler-free album destined to deliver hit after hit. \u201cI produced about 40 songs to get these 13 records together,\u201d Guetta explains. \u201cI wanted every song to be huge, phenomenal.\u201d\n\nNot only boasting massive pop appeal, Nothing But The Beat bears a broad, adventurous scope of sound that reaffirms Guetta\u2019s role as a pioneer of the electronica\/urban music hybrid. To start, the album blasts off with the dancefloor- ruling trinity of \u201cWhere Them Girls At,\u201d \u201cLittle Bad Girl,\u201d and \u201cTurn Me On,\u201d a triple threat that quickly proves Nothing But The Beat to be a high-energy hit machine. Riding off the feel-good frenzy of \u201cWhere Them Girls At,\u201d \u201cLittle Bad Girl\u201d pairs\n\nLudacris\u2019s masterfully bombastic flow with the smooth, sexed-up vocals of singer\/rapper Taio Cruz\u2014all while repurposing classic house-music elements (lush synth loops, crisp beats) into a radio-ready knockout. On the glorious and gut-punching \u201cTurn Me On,\u201d meanwhile, Guetta grants Nicki Minaj her stunning debut as a full-fledged songbird. \u201cEveryone knows she\u2019s the best female rapper right now,\u201d says Guetta. \u201cI wanted to take her somewhere she\u2019s never been.\u201d The track brilliantly contrasts Minaj\u2019s trademark madcap rapping with disarmingly tender vocal work, complementing her persona-switching performance with a slick barrage of erratic beats and spaced-out effects.\n\nEver experimental, Guetta transports his collaborators to previously unexplored sonic spaces all throughout Nothing But The Beat. On \u201cSweat,\u201d for instance, Guetta remixes one of his most prized DJ records as a stark, synth-heavy electro-hop track that spotlights Snoop Dogg\u2019s strikingly sleek vocals. Elsewhere on the album, guest artists match Guetta\u2019s ingenuity with their own brand of beamed-in-from-another-dimension whimsy and weirdness. Just as \u201cI Can Only Imagine\u201d alternates shimmering, buoyant beats with wildly skidding synth, the track continually trades off Chris Brown\u2019s warm melodies with the lyrical mischief- making of Lil Wayne (whom Guetta dubs \u201ca big genius\u201d). And on \u201cI Just Wanna F,\u201d Timbaland and Dev play a deliciously dirty version of the alphabet game while Guetta lays down a densely textured groove that makes this futuristic fever dream one of the album\u2019s most irresistible moments.\n\nAt the heart of Nothing But The Beat is a selection of soul-stirring songs that reveal the spirit behind Guetta\u2019s gorgeously crafted beats. With all the passion and power of an old-school dance anthem, \u201cNight Of Your Life\u201d shows off Jennifer Hudson\u2019s heavenly voice and remarkable range. On the slow-building \u201cWithout You,\u201d Usher opens with achingly vulnerable vocals that soon swell into a soaring, sweeping performance ultimately backed by delicate piano work. \u201cIt\u2019s possibly the biggest track on the album,\u201d says Guetta of \u201cWithout You.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a monster\u2014so big, so emotional.\u201d In a one-two punch, Guetta follows \u201cWithout You\u201d with the equally wistful opening moments of \u201cNothing Really Matters\u201d\u2014then turns it all around and elevates the Will.I.Am-led track into an escapist party jam. \u201cI love playing with both worlds,\u201d says Guetta, noting the bold disparity between the \u201ccrazy electro-beat and the super-sophisticated string arrangement\u201d on \u201cNothing Really Matters.\u201d To close out Nothing But The Beat, Guetta taps into the otherworldly vocal prowess of Australian indie-pop star Sia. Ethereal yet anthemic, \u201cTitanium\u201d enchants the listener with trance-inducing beats and a lyrical intensity unrivaled on the pop scene today.\n\nSwitching gears for the 10-track accompanying disc, Guetta reconnects with his electro roots and primary fan base. \u201cI didn\u2019t want people who\u2019ve been following me for years to feel left out,\u201d says Guetta. \u201cI feel like if I lose my original fans, it\u2019s over. Without those people that inspire me, I\u2019m just another pop producer.\u201d From tripped-out techno to drum-driven dubstep experiments to raw and riotous dirty house, the instrumental element of Nothing But The Beat illuminates Guetta\u2019s\nvirtuosity as a DJ\u2014an art he continues to hone and expand even as he racks up chart-topping records. That evidence of Guetta\u2019s remaining firmly rooted in club culture will no doubt satisfy longtime electronica devotees, while at the same time ushering a whole new audience into the dance-music underground. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a DJ first, I wanted to use my success to introduce newer fans to what my culture is about and where my inspiration comes from,\u201d Guetta notes.\n\nThat sizable success isn\u2019t nearly limited to Guetta\u2019s work as a recording artist and DJ. In addition to selling more than 5 million albums worldwide since his 2001 debut, Guetta acted as producer on the Black Eyed Peas\u2019 \u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d (the highest-selling digital release in music history). Along with his two Grammys (one for his remix of Madonna\u2019s \u201cRevolver\u201d in 2011, the other for his remix of One Love\u2019s \u201cWhen Love Takes Over), Guetta took home the Best DJ, Best Producer, and Best-Selling French Artist prizes at the 2010 World Music Awards. And having kicked off his DJ career as a teenager in his native France, Guetta also partners with his wife Cathy on promoting duties for the legendary F*** Me I\u2019m Famous dance parties (held in locations like Ibiza, Miami, New York, and Las Vegas since 1995). \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I make a beat that\u2019s going to be a song on the radio, or if I make a record that\u2019s meant to please DJs,\u201d Guetta says of continuing to bridge the gap between electronic and pop on Nothing But The Beat. \u201cI always just think of making people dance\u2014that\u2019s my first priority.\u201d","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Paris, FR","genre":"Electro \/ House","is_published":true,"record_label":"WHAT A MUSIC \/ EMI","talking_about_count":385414,"username":"DavidGuetta","website":"http:\/\/www.davidguetta.com http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/davidguetta http:\/\/twitter.com\/davidguetta ","were_here_count":0,"id":"7619396355","name":"David Guetta","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DavidGuetta","likes":47662021,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151608729911356","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1175094_10151608729911356_2108069061_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Today, as bandleader of The Lumineers, Wesley's replaced his pencil with a guitar and his drawings with songs.  He still practices a lot, and it still turns out good.\n\nIn the spring of 2005, childhood friends Wesley and Jeremiah began to collaborate, writing together and playing gigs around New York. After battling the city's cutthroat music scene and impossibly high cost of living, the two decided to expand their horizons. They packed everything they owned\u2014nothing more than a couple suitcases of clothes and a trailer full of musical instruments\u2014and headed for Denver, Colorado. It was less a pilgrimage than act of stubborn hopefulness.\n\nThe first thing they did in Denver was place a Craigslist ad for a cellist, and the first person to respond was Neyla Pekarek, a classically trained Denver native. As a trio, they began playing at the Meadowlark, a gritty basement club where the city's most talented songwriters gathered every Tuesday for an open mic and dollar PBRs. Neyla softened Wes and Jer's rough edges while expanding her skills to mandolin and piano. And so The Lumineers sound took shape; an amalgam of  heart-swelling stomp-and-clap acoustic rock, classic pop, and front-porch folk.\n\nIn 2011, an eponymous, self-recorded EP led to a self-booked tour, and before long The Lumineers started attracting devout fans, first across the Western US, then back in their old East Coast stamping grounds. Young, old and in-between, they're drawn by songs like \"Ho Hey\" and \"Stubborn Love,\" Americana-inflected barnburners in the vein of the Avett Brothers and Mumford & Sons. They're drawn by songs like \"Slow it Down\" and \"Dead Sea,\" slow, sultry ballads that suggest the raw revelations of Jeff Buckley and Ryan Adams.

{"about":"http:\/\/www.deathcabforcutie.com\/tour","band_members":"Benjamin Gibbard, Nicholas Harmer, Jason McGerr, Christopher Walla","bio":"By their seventh studio album, many bands are running out of creative steam and original ideas. But in the case of Death Cab for Cutie, nothing could be further from the truth. Codes and Keys is singular in the quartet\u2019s catalog when it comes to sonic exploration and lyrical ambition. If anything, the band has never sounded more excited to experiment with textures, words, sounds and even the process of recording itself. \n\nDeath Cab created Codes and Keys in studios up and down the West Coast, in short bursts over a period of seven months. These studios included Sound City in Van Nuys, California (where the band recorded The Twilight Saga: New Moon single \u201cMeet Me on the Equinox\u201d), The Warehouse in Vancouver, drummer Jason McGerr\u2019s own Two Sticks Audio and Tiny Telephone in San Francisco. In between these ten-day or two-week recording sessions, they would put the songs aside and let them \u201cgestate,\u201d bassist Nick Harmer says. \n\nWhile Death Cab for Cutie has always produced their best work by recording in a piecemeal fashion like this, Harmer says that the process of making Codes and Keys was \u201cmost fragmented that we\u2019ve done in terms of time-on-time-off.\u201d But McGerr found a real benefit to having some distance from the music: \u201cThere was this constant renewal of fresh inspiration that came from moving from studio to studio.\u201d \n\nBut unlike the studio process for 2008's Grammy-nominated Narrow Stairs \u2013 an album the band recorded to tape in real time, with minimal overdubs and studio trickery \u2013 Codes and Keys turned into what guitarist\/multi-instrumentalist\/producer Chris Walla has taken to calling a \u201cconstruction project.\u201d \n\nThe band focused on capturing the best take of their parts \u2013 at times separately, at other times in pairs \u2013 and built songs by layering these performances (and other musical ideas) on top of each other. \u201cWe've deconstructed little pieces of songs before like this,\u201d Walla says. \u201c[But] we've never pulled the thread out of the whole sweater and then made a new sweater out of it. Not like this.\u201d\n\nCodes and Keys immediately makes a statement with the first song, \u201cHome Is a Fire.\u201d Staticky percussion chatters beneath several layers of bustling rhythms and echoing, spooky vocals. The lush instrumentation continues with the title track, on which strings from San Francisco\u2019s Magik*Magik Orchestra sway in time with oompah drums and graceful vaudeville piano. The orchestra also adds lightness to \u201cStay Young, Go Dancing,\u201d an upbeat album-ender that\u2019s as fanciful as Randy Newman\u2019s Pixar movie contributions. \n\nElsewhere, the New Order-like \u201cDoors Unlocked and Open\u201d has a dense, dark bassline, while the centerpiece \u201cUnobstructed Views\u201d meshes floating-in-space electronic noises with angelic twinkling and strident piano; the effect is a heavenly Explosions in the Sky. \u201cSt. Peter\u2019s Cathedral\u201d begins with Gibbard singing a cappella, and gradually blooms into a mournful but somehow joyous song filled with wordless, bubbly harmonies and cinematic synthesized drone. \n\n\u201cWith all the songs that Ben wrote, he really experimented a lot with his songwriting,\u201d McGerr observes. \u201cHe started to use his voice more as an instrument than just somebody singing lyrics.\u201d \n\nWalla too says he approached Codes and Keys as an experiment, and he\u2019s grateful that his bandmates \u201cwere all willing to let me lead them down the rabbit hole on a lot of different songs.\u201d He approached some tunes as if he was a scientist doing an experiment, constructing elaborate gear setups (think a Rube Goldberg machine) to create, manipulate or trigger certain sounds. The result is a complex album whose gifts only reveal themselves with repeated listens. Even Codes and Keys\u2019 poppiest moments, \u201cMonday Morning\u201d and \u201cUnderneath the Sycamore,\u201d have dense layers of bustling texture lurking below the surface. \n\n\u201c[In the last couple of years] I for one have been really moved by a lot of records that have some pretty unconventional palettes,\u201d Walla says. \u201cI've been learning that there's a way to present a song and a way to move somebody with a landscape they haven't necessarily seen or heard before. I really wanted to try to do that. I wanted to try and make a new visual for the cinema of song.\u201d \n\nDespite the nomadic recording process \u2013 and the expanded sonic palette -- it\u2019s a testament to the band\u2019s talent and chemistry that Codes and Keys is a cohesive statement, a collection of songs that hangs together as a well-sequenced album. Walla says that cohesion is something he discussed with Codes and Keys' mixer, Alan Moulder. \u201cI was really interested in making a record rather than a recording,\u201d Walla says. \u201cAnd particularly when it came to vocal treatments and drawing big, heavy dark lines between verses and choruses and doing that sort of thing, I asked him to be pretty brave and pretty bold with all of that stuff.\u201d \n\nIndeed, Moulder's deft mixing touches helped Codes and Keys' nuanced details stand out. \u201cEvery song is its own little sonic journey, which is a cheesy way of putting it,\u201d Gibbard says. \u201cHe found a place on the shelf for every little sound.\u201d \n\nAdds Harmer, \u201cI\u2019m so thankful he was a part of this process. His mixes are incredible, and he brought something to the band that we\u2019ve never had, just that outside perspective. It was nice to have an editor, for lack of a better word, at the very end of it to be able to sift through all of the ideas and focus in on the things that he thought were the most salient and most important ones to save.\u201d \n\nThe attention to detail in the music matches the measured precision of Gibbard\u2019s lyrics on Codes and Keys. Silence is just as important as what words are spoken, and economy of language is prized. \u201cThroughout writing almost all of the songs on this record, [I found] that I wanted to keep it really concise,\u201d Gibbard says. \u201cI wanted songs to have more hooks, less lyrics, if that makes sense.\u201d \n\nIf anything, often the lyrics are the hooks. The verses of \u201cDoors Unlocked and Open,\u201d for instance, are a series of clipped but evocative phrases: \u201cIsolations \/ Dotted lines \/ Seas of concrete \/ With wild eyes \/ Streaking colors.\u201d On \u201cUnobstructed Views,\u201d the song blooms into a section of stacked, Beach Boys-go-prog harmonies cooing, \u201cNew love.\u201d \n\n\u201cThis record\u2019s more oblique than the last couple of records were,\u201d Walla says. \u201cIt\u2019s really economical, but it\u2019s also not hyper-literal. There are pieces of it that are, but it\u2019s not as plain in story terms -- or language terms, I guess, than the last couple records have been. And I for one am really thrilled that I don\u2019t have any idea what like five or six of these songs are about.\u201d \n\nThe mystery doesn\u2019t diminish the impact of the songs \u2013 if anything, they\u2019re more relatable because listeners can apply their own interpretation of the lyrics. \u201c[As a band] we\u2019ve always encouraged Ben to write from his heart \u2013 what do you know, what are you going through \u2013 and that will be the truth,\u201d Harmer says. \n\nAs always, that soul-searching guided Gibbard to dark and light places. But while acknowledging that he wrote several songs \u201cwith a heavy pen\u201d Gibbard says he\u2019s most proud that Codes and Keys is a \u201cvery even, well-balanced record, emotionally speaking.\u201d Indeed, the songs run the gamut from \u201cSt. Peter\u2019s Cathedral\u201d \u2013 which ends with a gut-wrenching refrain, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing past this\u201d -- to the title track\u2019s assertion, \u201cWe are one, we are alive.\u201d \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily know it at the time, but [I was writing Narrow Stairs in] a very dark period of my life,\u201d Gibbard says. \u201cI had lost control over a lot of things that I should have had control over, and I needed to make a lot of changes in my life. The record is a very dark album in a lot of ways. And after we finished making that record and I was listening back to it, I had this realization that I don\u2019t want to write this record ever again. I don\u2019t want this to be the thing that I write all the time.\u201d \n\nChange is certainly something that the members of Death Cab for Cutie experienced in the years between recording Narrow Stairs and Codes and Keys. McGerr now has two children, Walla ended a long relationship and moved away from Portland and Harmer got married. Gibbard\u2019s own life changes, in fact, inspired one of the recurring themes of Codes and Keys \u2013 musings about the search for (and idea of) home. \n\nThe lyrical phrases in \u201cHome Is a Fire\u201d display a certain anxiety \u2013 \u201cBricks make me nervous,\u201d \u201cPlates they will shift\/houses will shake\u201d \u2013 and ends with the resigned realization, \u201cNothing\u2019s the same.\u201d The album\u2019s first single, \u201cYou Are a Tourist,\u201d makes the insightful observation, \u201cAnd if you feel just like a tourist in the city you were born, then it\u2019s time to go\/And define your destination: there\u2019s so many different places to call home.\u201d \n\n\u201cI feel like if there is a theme of home throughout the record, it has as much to do because of the changes that have happened in my life,\u201d Gibbard says. \u201cI\u2019ve moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, I\u2019ve gotten married, I\u2019ve rediscovered what the definition of home is.\u201d The latter discovery spurred Gibbard to reflect on and revisit \u2013 intentionally \u2013 some of his past lyrics. \n\nFor instance, the line \u201cLife is sweet in the belly of the beast\u201d on \u201cStay Young, Go Dancing\u201d softens the staunch anti-California sentiments on The Photo Album\u2019s \u201cWhy You\u2019d Want to Live Here.\u201d The bird metaphor of Narrow Stairs\u2019 \u201cTalking Bird,\u201d meanwhile, is now turned around and applied to the protagonist of \u201cMonday Morning.\u201d \u201c[There is] a re-engineering of the lyrics in a handful of spots on the record,\u201d Gibbard says, \u201cjust because I want to reclaim sentiment that I wrote about and re-evaluate it and re-present it.\u201d \n\nIndeed, Codes and Keys' lyrics are very much focused on the here-and-now, which is something Harmer admires. \u201cI\u2019m really happy that his songs are at a maturity level and have a level of wisdom that reflect his age and his adventures,\u201d he says. \u201cThey ring true with me in that sense.\u201d \n\nWalla agrees. \u201cI\u2019m so into this record and connected to this record lyrically in a way that I have only been in pieces for the last couple of records,\u201d he says, citing the \u201cinvitation and celebration\u201d of them. \n\nIn conversation, it\u2019s obvious that the members of Death Cab for Cutie are still each other\u2019s biggest fans. More important, they genuinely enjoy making music with each other and being in a band together. Their only motivation is to create music they like \u2013 and to impress and satisfy each other. Theirs might not be a controversial rock & roll story \u2013 but it is one rooted in stable, supportive brotherhood. \n\n\u201cWe left college and spent years in a van together, and we\u2019ve spent all of this time learning from one another and growing emotionally and otherwise over the years,\u201d Harmer says. \u201cThe fabric of our relationships is very complex and certainly something that is very important to me, and probably to everyone in the band. We are a support network for each other; we are so much more than four guys who get together and play music.\u201d\n\n\n","booking_agent":"Billions Booking","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Seattle, WA","general_manager":"Zeitgeist Artist Management","genre":"Alternative Rock","hometown":"Seattle, WA","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Atlantic Records","record_label":"Atlantic Records","talking_about_count":8238,"username":"deathcabforcutie","website":"http:\/\/www.deathcabforcutie.com http:\/\/twitter.com\/dcfc","were_here_count":0,"id":"6871006677","name":"Death Cab for Cutie","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/deathcabforcutie","likes":2395641,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150985577601678","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/318194_10150985577601678_1756330682_n.jpg","offset_y":100,"offset_x":0}}

Propelled by the omniscience of a song called \u2018Sweet Disposition\u2019, the album sold nearly a million copies worldwide. The Melbourne four-piece made a breakthrough at odds with the flash-in-the-pan nature of rock\u2019s revolving door, resulting in a Brit nomination for International Breakthrough Artist and two sell-out UK tours including a trio of shows at London\u2019s Shepherds Bush Empire. \u2018Sweet Disposition\u2019 may have been their not-so-secret weapon, but they backed it up with an album of nuanced epic-pop perfection and a work ethic that would mean they wouldn\u2019t see their own beds for the best part of three years.\n\nDougy Mandagi (vocals, guitar), Lorenzo Sillitto (guitar), Jonny Aherne (bass) and Toby Dundas (drums) had barely relocated from Melbourne to London when they made a tour bus their home-from-home. They\u2019d arrived in 2009 as a band wet behind the ears but armed with songs fit to headline festivals and an ambition that was keen on getting them there. Having recorded \u2018Conditions\u2019 with Arctic Monkeys producer Jim Abbiss, their debut was released in August 2009 and what followed was an extensive period of intensive, relentless touring that only ended at the beginning of 2011. If they\u2019d pitched up in the English capital as relative novices, come the end of the year, they\u2019d most definitely found their feet. \u201cMy expectations were to play as many shows as possible and see where it went from there,\u201d says Sillitto. \u201cThe thought of getting into the Top Ten and selling however many records that we did was never really a goal. As high points go, we played a festival in Australia called Splendour In The Grass and at that point it was the biggest crowd we\u2019d ever played to, like 20,000 people, the reaction was just incredible.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re onstage and the crowd are singing so loud that you can\u2019t hear yourself,\u201d adds Mandagi, \u201cthat\u2019s quite an amazing moment.\u201d\n\nAnd so, it was in these triumphant circumstances that The Temper Trap, now bolstered to a five-piece with the permanent addition of Joseph Greer on keyboards, reconvened after a shorter-than-expected holiday (\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019m gonna disappear for a year\u2019, but after a week and a half, I was so bored,\u201d laughs Mandagi) to begin work on their second album. With minimal writing having taken place amidst the whirlwind of the Conditions\u2019 touring cycle, the band entered sessions for album two with a clean slate and little idea of what would surface. Mandagi, though, was aware he had little control over what the main lyrical themes would entail. \u201cI was in a relationship whilst touring the last album and it went bad. I guess I opened the floodgates \u2013 I thought I was over it but I had a lot of things to get off my chest so I started writing all these mopey heartbreak songs.\u201d \n\nSituated in their adopted home of Hackney, the band approached the writing sessions much as they did their debut, \u201csitting there and nutting things out,\u201d as Sillitto puts it. By the time they were ready to head to the famous Sound Factory studios in Los Angeles to record with Beck collaborator Tony Hoffer (in Aherne\u2019s words: \u201ca great guy with great ideas\u201d), they\u2019d written 35 songs that were whittled down to 17 to record. Of these, says Mandagi, \u201c4 or 5 are heartbreak songs \u2013 the rest didn\u2019t make the cut.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing in LA was the right choice for this album,\u201d explains Greer. \u201cTony has his own studio so we didn't need to spend a lot of time trying get things sounding right. On top of that, the weather was amazing the whole time and I'm sure that did a lot to elevate our moods.\u201d\n\nWhat emerges is their self-titled second album, a record of two distinct personalities, one of melancholic, mesmeric balladry and one of synth-led, anthemic powerhouse pop. \u201cEach time I play my friends these songs they all have a different favorite,\u201d says Aherne. \u201cThis really feels like a record that could have something for everyone.\u201d\n\nTheir trick isn\u2019t that perfunctory, though; most songs on \u2018The Temper Trap\u2019 see the band\u2019s two disparate sides bleed into each other. So, the fuzzy stomp of \u2018Need Your Love\u2019 appears to be a stadium-slaying cocksure sing-along but is in fact underpinned with lost soul yearning, whilst \u2018Dreams\u2019 should be a slow-burning album track but is in fact loaded with one of the record\u2019s hookiest choruses. Wonderful contradictions spring up all over the place; \u2018I\u2019m Gonna Wait\u2019, a song recorded after repeated listens to the last Zola Jesus record, is a brooding slow snarl that has a celestial chant at its core, \u2018Rabbit Hole\u2019 is an intimate, solemn vignette that explodes in a frenzied, euphoric climax and \u2018Trembling Hands\u2019 is swirling fire\u2019n\u2019brimstone alt-rock. \n\n\u2018The Sea Is Calling\u2019 is one of the starkest and most soulful things they\u2019ve done (\u201clyrically, Dougy just transports me to another place,\u201d says Greer) and the forlorn surge of \u2018This Isn\u2019t Happiness\u2019 allows the taut interplay of the band\u2019s rhythm section to flourish. The pop grandeur of \u2018Where Do We Go From Here\u2019 and the jagged menace of \u2018Never Again\u2019, meanwhile, highlight the shift in dynamics from their debut by revolving around Greer\u2019s searing keyboard parts. More new avenues are explored on \u2018Miracle\u2019 and final track \u2018Leaving The Heartbreak Hotel\u2019, the former flickering into life around intricate beats and sparse soundscapes and the latter using a reverb-drenched dubstep groove as a starting point upon which they build an achingly tender atmospheric closer. \n\nWhilst the majority of these songs ingrain themselves upon you with repeated listens, there is one that will stand out from the off. \u2018London\u2019s Burning\u2019 was written in the aftermath of last summer\u2019s riots as Mandagi struggled to deal with what he\u2019d watched unfold outside his flat on Mare Street. \u201cIt was bizarre,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it was such a significant moment than I just had to write about it.\u201d Again, their playful contrariness comes into focus \u2013 its subject matter might be dark and devious, but London\u2019s Burning\u2019s sounds like The Clash soundtracking a glam rock musical.  \n\nAt the center of everything is the charismatic, enigmatic Mandagi and that voice, a swooping croon that could lift a 747. The Indonesian-born, Melbourne-raised, London-living frontman is the driving force behind \u2018The Temper Trap\u2019s recurring theme of displacement. \u201cI definitely went through phases where the only place I felt like I belonged was on the road, on the stage, in a bus,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing on the road gave me a sense of purpose. I love it and there\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be, but at the same time it can be lonely. That\u2019s all ammo for me as a lyricist.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s exactly the sort of juxtaposition that makes \u2018The Temper Trap\u2019 such an intriguing listen. It\u2019s a snapshot of a band blossoming, their songs matching their own skyscraping expectations. \u201cI\u2019m an ambitious person,\u201d says Dougy. \u201cI want this album to be bigger, and I want the record to do well, I don\u2019t want just one or two songs to do well, I want people to realise we\u2019re capable of making records.\u201d Rest assured, the penny is about to drop.

{"about":"Download the Goo Goo Dolls new album Magnetic on iTunes! http:\/\/smarturl.it\/iTunesMagnetic. Watch the \"Come To Me\" video: http:\/\/youtu.be\/U8VMYLniuDk","band_members":"John Rzeznik\nRob Takac\nMike Malinin","bio":"After more than two decades as a band, with nine albums, a catalog of songs that have become ingrained in the pop consciousness and countless concerts for millions of fans, the Goo Goo Dolls are feeling particularly good about their new album: Magnetic.\n\nMore to the point, the Goo Goo Dolls are feeling particularly good. Period.\n\u201cThis album was really upbeat and fun,\u201d says John Rzeznik, the trio\u2019s primary singer, songwriter and guitarist since it was founded in Buffalo in 1986. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve made a record like this in a while. Just had a great time doing it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a great time overall for the musicians. Bassist Robby Takac, whose partnership with Rzeznik has been the band\u2019s foundation since the start, and his wife have just had their first child. And Rzeznik is getting married this summer. \nNot to mention that recently three of the band\u2019s songs placed in Billboard\u2019s Top 100 of 1992-2012, with \u201cIris\u201d standing at No. 1. That song has also connected with a new generation, as Dolls fan Taylor Swift has been performing it in her concerts. \n\nThat joy is all there in the spirit of the 11 new songs on the album, for which Rzeznik, Takac and drummer Mike Malinin \u2014 the lineup steady since 1995 \u2014 recorded in New York, London and Los Angeles with Gregg Wattenberg (Train), Rob Cavallo (Green Day), John Shanks (Bon Jovi) and Greg Wells (Katy Perry). From the celebratory single \u201cRebel Beat\u201d to the love-rediscovery ballad \u201cSlow It Down,\u201d from the blue-collar anthem \u201cKeep the Car Running\u201d to the meltingly romantic \u201cCome to Me,\u201d Magnetic is an album bursting with a spirit of renewal. And nowhere is it more explicit than in one of two Takac-penned songs: \u201cHappiest of Days.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the writing is an extension of ourselves,\u201d Rzeznik says. \u201cMy life\u2019s amazing. When I sit and think about my life, it really has been incredible.\u201d\nNo argument from Takac.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing to me,\u201d he says. \u201cAll these years now we\u2019ve been playing in this band together and we still somehow manage to grow. That allows us to keep making it happen. We never denied what the situation was at the moment. Right now we\u2019re here and living this moment, and some cool things are happening in our lives.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a contrast from the poetically introspective tone of 2010\u2019s Something For the Rest of Us, which reflected some personal turmoil.\n\n\u201cThis album feels like this is where we came out the other side and are in the daylight again,\u201d he says. \u201cGot a little dark on the last record. But that was something I needed to do, where I was at. This is where I am now. Yeah, you know \u2014 I got myself up, brushed myself off and looked around, and things were fine. Why not celebrate?\u201d\n\nEven a dark-sounding title, such as \u201cWhen The World Breaks Your Heart,\u201d reveals a world of happiness.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a song about friendship,\u201d he says. \u201cReal friendship. About when you find out who the people are who really care about you and love you, like on moving day, or times of need.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, the making of the album represented a break from past methods too. Rzeznik first worked with those collaborators on writing and pre-production of the songs. \n\n\u201cI approached it a lot differently this time,\u201d Rzeznik says. \u201cRather than writing a whole bunch of songs and then going into the studio and recording them and seeing if it worked, as we\u2019d done before, I would write a song, make a demo, then Robby and Mike came in and we played it. Wound up being much quicker. And I did some co-writing with Gregg Wattenberg and John Shanks, tried to let go of the outcome.\u201d\n\nInspiration came from many sources. \u201cA lot of it got cut in a recording studio that sits 12 floors above Times Square, full of windows,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re at the cultural epicenter of Western civilization. It was unbelievably stimulating. In a lot of ways this is a real New York record.\u201d \n\nOpening song \u201cRebel Beat,\u201d co-written by Rzeznik with Wattenberg, sets that tone, growing out of a summer stroll the singer took in Lower Manhattan, coming across an Italian neighborhood street party.\n\n\u201cEveryone was having a great time, little kids, old people \u2014 and the smell of everything, and it was so hot. I just wanted to be part of it so bad!\u201d\nSuch scenes are evoked throughout, the music carrying the spirit as much as the lyrics. For \u201cMore of You,\u201d Shanks and Rzeznik experimented, subtly, with electronics, the anthemic sound portraying a resolute pursuit of love. The two painted the \u201ccomplications\u201d of relationships with equal flair with the elated-yet-tumultuous sound of \u201cCaught in the Storm.\u201d Takac brings another rock twist to \u201cBringing On the Light,\u201d with piano and organ giving a feel that he says is in part inspired by the great English band Badfinger.\n\nAnd for \u201cBulletproof Angel,\u201d a soaring ballad co-written by Rzeznik and long-time friend Andy Stochansky, producer Greg Wells brought in orchestrator Joel McNeely for a full strings arrangement, the latter recorded at London\u2019s legendary Abbey Road.\n\nAt the core throughout is the Goo Goo Dolls\u2019 blue-collar Buffalo origins, the same energy that fueled the group when if first garnered buzz on the local, then regional and then national club scenes. Nowhere is it more explicit than on \u201cKeep the Car Running,\u201d a song about the disillusionment of youth, about wanting to escape, but also an earnest love-letter to home. \n\n\u201cBuffalo had its own unique sound,\u201d Rzeznik says. \u201cI think we definitely retain that. When I pick up an acoustic guitar and start singing, it\u2019s me. We can\u2019t be anybody else. I like what I sing. We like what we write. And if we don\u2019t like it, we don\u2019t play it.\u201d \n","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Los Angeles, CA","hometown":"Buffalo.

{"about":"\"Native\" the new album from OneRepublic out now at iTunes: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/Native","band_members":"Ryan Tedder: Lead Vocals\/Guitar\/Piano\nZach Filkins: Guitar\/Vocals \nEddie Fisher: Drums\nBrent Kutzle: Bass\/Cello\/Vocals \nDrew Brown: Guitar","bio":"To those who do not know the full story on OneRepublic, they may see a talented pop-rock group propelled to \u201covernight\u201d success after being discovered by one of the world\u2019s most celebrated super-producers. The band\u2019s first single, \u201cApologize,\u201d which was remixed by Timbaland, has been Top 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 for ten consecutive weeks, rocketing all the way to 2. The song has sold two million legal downloads, maintained its 1 position on the Top 40 chart for two months, and entered the history books by shattering the record for the most spins at radio in just one week with over 10,000 spins. All of which adds up to one of the most eagerly-anticipated CDs of the year- Dreaming Out Loud \u2013 OneRepublic\u2019s Mosley Music Group\/Interscope debut. \n\nHowever, explaining away the success of this band as an overnight sensation would be short-sighted and inaccurate. The story of the band\u2019s road to success, and how that journey is expressed in the inspiring lyrical content of this album, would be lost, as well. Facing opposition and disappointment, OneRepublic has clung to its dreams \u2013 and that tenacity is finally paying off. \n\nWhile OneRepublic might be the first rock band on Mosley Music group, it isn\u2019t the first time that OneRepublic\u2019s frontman, Ryan Tedder, and Timbaland\u2019s paths have crossed. OneRepublic has had a circuitous journey from then to now. That journey began in 2001. Tedder was living in Nashville and nabbed a record deal for winning a singer-songwriter contest; a validation for someone who strove to be a songwriter who could write \u201dmore than just a catchy tune. There\u2019s nothing like a good pop song, but there\u2019s a fine line between accessibility and credibility,\u201d says Tedder. \n\nThanks to a mutual friend, Tedder got a call from Timbaland, who wanted him to come work with him. Just like in the movies, 21-year-old Tedder quit his day job, sold his car to buy equipment, and enrolled in \u201cProduction 101 at the University of Timbaland.\u201d Taken under the A-list producer\u2019s wing, Tedder was given the opportunity to get behind the boards in state-of-the-art studios from Miami to NY to LA; \u201cIt was a dream come true.\u201d Despite the invaluable education, it was clear that while Tedder wanted to become an artist, his mentor wanted to develop Tedder as a producer. After two years, and with Timbaland\u2019s blessing, Tedder moved on and soon became that guy. Working under the nom de plume \u201cAlias,\u201d Tedder racked up production\/songwriter credits for artists ranging from techno star Paul Oakenfold, pop\/R&B singers Leona Lewis and Natasha Bedingfield, and rapper Bubba Sparxxx. In fact, just this past year, Tedder penned and produced three international 1\u2019s, a top 10, and two top 40\u2019s, including Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Top 20 banger, \u201cDo It Well.\u201d \n\nYet, Tedder\u2019s desire to be the guy in front of the mic was still burning. In 2002, he returned to Colorado Springs, Colorado, and looked up high school friend, guitarist Zach Filkins, who had spent his childhood studying classical guitar in Barcelona, Spain and then moved to Colorado Springs. \n\nIn 2003, Tedder and Filkins moved to Los Angeles to put a band together. They soon found out that doing that is not so easy, and had to figure out how to get by. At points, there was not even enough money to buy groceries. Hard times made it difficult to keep a band together and the membership kept changing- until Tedder and Filkins connected with Drew Brown (guitar), Brent Kutzle (bass, cello), and Eddie Fisher (drums). \n\nNow solidified, OneRepublic got a major label deal, but for various reasons it fell through, and they were left in limbo and demoralized. \u201cAfter all that time trying to get to where we were, getting dropped took the wind out of my sails,\u201d Tedder says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t sure if we wanted to go on (with the band).\u201d At that time, however, their MySpace page started getting thousands of hits, making them the biggest band on the site. \u201cMaybe the music climate changed,\u201d Filkins explains. \u201cAll of a sudden, we were getting e-mails from kids saying that because of one of our songs, they didn\u2019t commit suicide or they got through their parents\u2019 divorce. We finally connected with the audience. We said to ourselves, \u2018we can\u2019t quit now.\u2019\u201d \n\nSoon enough, the labels came knocking, including Timbaland, with his Mosley Music Group label. Timbaland knew first-hand the depth of Tedder\u2019s talent and OneRepublic\u2019s potential. So everything came full circle when Tim brought OneRepublic into the Mosley Music Group family, making them the first rock band on his label, and executive-producing Dreaming Out Loud. \n\nThe success OneRepublic has achieved since then might have taken some by surprise, but not the group\u2019s singer\/songwriter. The toughest thing to do is write a hit song,\u201c says Tedder, \u201cbut sometimes you just know when you\u2019ve written something special. \u2018Apologize\u2019 gave me goose bumps as soon as I finished it.\u201d \n\nThe first clue that his instincts were right came early in 2007, when Timbaland\u2019s \u201cApologize\u201d remix (both that and the original version are featured on Dreaming Out Loud) appeared on his platinum plus Timbaland Presents: Shock Value. \n\n\u201cRyan is a great person, a great songwriter and just so musically talented,\u201d Timbaland says. \u201cOneRepublic bring something out of each other. They work so well together and it\u2019s a very natural chemistry.\u201d \n\nLargely produced by Greg Wells (Rufus Wainwright, Pink, Mika) and with a couple tracks produced by Tedder, that chemistry is evident in the songs, such as the second single, \u201cStop And Stare,\u201d a fusion of anthemic guitars and insistent vocals, and the hushed ballad \u201cCome Home\u201d (one of three songs on the album produced by Tedder). Dreaming Out Loud introduces a group committed to the idea that people want real songs, with real truths, not marketing strategies. \n\nFolks talk a lot about fate and timing; two things OneRepublic knows quite well. Having ricocheted back-and-forth between near-success, disappointment, and fruition, OneRepublic has stayed true to their dreams - and seen them come true in ways they could never have imagined. Tedder holds that \u201cthere are certain things that are within your control and that\u2019s how hard you work, how determined you are, how much you want it, but you can\u2019t control timing. It\u2019s going to happen when it\u2019s meant to happen, and right now, that\u2019s how it is for OneRepublic. It took a long time but all of this has come at the right time.\u201d \n","booking_agent":"U.S. and Canada Booking: CAA \/ International Booking: ian\u0040itb.co.uk","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Rock \/ Alternative","hometown":"Denver, CO\/ City of Angels, CA","influences":"The Beatles \nDebbie Gibson? \nMagnet !! \nRadiohead \nU2 \nBobby Brown \nAnother Bad Creation \nThe Verve \nPink Floyd \nWilson Philips \nThe Cure ","is_published":true,"press_contact":"1R Questions: email.onerepublic\u0040gmail.com","record_label":"Mosley Music Group \/ Interscope","talking_about_count":83117,"username":"OneRepublic","website":"http:\/\/www.onerepublic.com\/ http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/onerepublic http:\/\/twitter.com\/onerepublic Ping: http:\/\/bit.ly\/fCLmzn ","were_here_count":0,"id":"24983228911","name":"OneRepublic","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/OneRepublic","likes":5066889,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152297977698912","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/5912_10152297977698912_84540368_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Make Yourself Foundation: http:\/\/www.makeyourselffoundation.org","artists_we_like":"The Police, Bjork, Mute Math, Phish, Massive Attack","band_members":"Brandon Boyd\nMike Einziger\nJose Pasillas\nChris Kilmore\nBen Kenney","bio":"Success is a devilish opiate. A swift and heady drink that goes down smooth at first, and then starts to burn your throat and rattle your bones. Only to leave crater sized holes in your constitution the next day. We all love a good success story, don't we? But interestingly, what usually makes it 'good' are not the 'good' things about the story. No. It's the bad things that perk our ears up. It's the tragedy inherent in the struggle that keeps us tuned in. I am in a band called Incubus. We are all about the same age; and we started our band in 1991. Our story is not unlike other success stories. It has its peaks and valleys, its struggles, its triumphs, its highest highs and lowest lows. But it's not the bad parts of our unfolding story that have intrigued people over all of these years. To tell you the truth, I am not sure exactly what has kept people interested in us this long. I'd like to think it's the music we make and ultimately share. I'd like to think it's because we have struck chords with people at very specific times in their lives and that when they hear certain songs they are harkened back to the not so distant past wherein life changing events and turns in their own stories coincided with lyrics and rhythms. Sounds meandering into symmetry with an individual's psyche like that rare moment when your body and your shadow line up on a wall. If the music has been the true catalyst for our (once again) unfolding success story, than I'd say we were right on track. Perhaps we are wanderers who have tasted the drug, smiled and mused at the kaleidoscope it wrought, then woke the next day, shook it off and kept truckin'. \n\nStill mildly hungover from our night on the town, we decided that it was hi-time we wrote another record. It had been five years since the release of 'Light Grenades', our last full length offering, and we were feeling a collective itch to chase that dragon once again. \nBy about three songs into the writing process, I think we began to understand that we were unearthing something new. And excitedly, we began chasing that new rabbit as far down, around and into the wormhole as it led us. At a certain point amongst all of this creative wandering we began to understand quite clearly that certain creative mantras were reemerging. Both consciously and unconsciously. Words like, 'economy', 'elegance', 'space', and 'restraint' kept creeping back into our many conversations. Words we had toyed with in the past, but never so deliberately and never so confidently. Sprinkle into this caldron a dash of whimsy and a pinch of psychedelia, let it stew in the recording studio for a couple of months and you get this: 'If Not Now, When?\u2019 Our unabashed, romantic, lush, sonic love letter to the world. It's darker, slower, more rich, more refined,  and more involved than anything Incubus has birthed to date. And I am so happy to share it with all of you. This entire time, Incubus has essentially been searching for a sense of balance between all of the possibilities inherent in crafting a song. I do believe that for many years now we have been searching for something different. Something unique, both to the world and to us as a band. We decided that 'If Not Now, When?\u2019 our 6th full length studio album would be just that.\n\nIn the title track, we set the tone of the album. A stirring in the water somewhere, a long time ago, sends ripples outward. Beautifully. Symmetrically, and relentlessly pulsing out, out, out. They travel countless miles and eventually arrive at shallow waters. Then the triumphant finale. The breaking wave, after gaining thousands of miles of momentum, arcs forward into the future; the wave is about to break. If not now, when? A unique event in space and time. Never to be repeated ever again. Now. Now. Now. \n\nOur first single, 'Adolescents' is perhaps the most familiar sounding Incubus song on this new album. It begins with Michael's unmistakable and inimitable guitar work and rolls its way into a kind of drunken waltz. Creeping its way into the idea that we are collectively just about to reach our cultural teenage years. It does seem like we've been around forever. Us, I mean. People. Culture. But all it takes is a sojourn into Earth's biological record to realize that WE are quite new! And the transitions at play in our complex little game are akin to the struggles that an adolescent might endure. \n\n'Promises, Promises', is our homage to the pop songs of yester-morrow. Referencing the deservedly ubiquitous artists of our parents' generation, we are here attempting to craft an artisan's clock. A piece that ticks effortlessly on the strength of its good design, its beauty and its simplicity. Herein a young girl, after so many failed attempts at love, has resigned herself to a \"road of least resistance\". Armoring herself against the pain of intimacy by only engaging in surface affairs. Only to meet someone who she CAN trust with her most valued of possessions, her heart. But she can barely recognize what the real thing looks like after so much time running away from it. \n\n'Friends and Lovers' is a song that I always hoped we would write. I do believe it is my most favorite thus far. It speaks to the heart of many of our culturally held biases about relationships and what love looks like. It combats the long held notions of love and intimacy and plainly states that Friends make the best Lovers. And that love can in fact be born of friendship and can indeed last outside of our pre-prescribed notions of what it looks like, feels like and how it endures. Movies and Religion have largely defined our cultural notions of this most important of topics. And in this song it was my attempt to share a different idea of what modern love might look like. \n\n'Tomorrow's Food' was written about two years ago. Making it the first song penned for this album. Here Michael shows us once again how deep his musical well runs. A vibrant, sonic quilt is wrapped around us and we are lulled by its choices and its warmth. Lyrically I am specifically referencing Philosopher Ken Wilbur's quote from 'A Brief History Of Everything\u2019, \"No epoch is finally privileged. We are all tomorrow's food. The process continues. And spirit is found in the process itself, not in any particular epoch, or time, or place.\" No one had ever put so succinctly and eloquently into words how I felt about growing up. About reaching my mid-thirties. After reading this quote, and witnessing the vast push and pull at play between the old and the new, the young and the not so young, I saw the inherent beauty and wisdom in the process of it all. And consequently, wrote a song about it. It is in this reporter's opinion that we are in the midst of a massive shift. Culturally, ethically, artistically, technologically, intellectually, philosophically and spiritually. Almost of the \"-ally's\". This shift has occurred before; with different details and end results of course. And this shift will happen again. Absolutely. The new thing at play is our awareness of this shift. The awareness that there is never an 'end of the world'. Only the process and the choice to witness and to participate. What may feel like the end of the world is that humbling moment when you realize that a new set of ideas has usurped your generation's ideas. Confused and confounded by the \"way things are going\" you can't help but think it's all going to shit, and that you have to fight to defend what you've built. But in actuality what is occurring is a necessary evolution. A handing over of the collective baton. If not now, when?\n\nWhen we recorded and released our first album 'S.C.I.E.N.C.E.', we were but wee lads overflowing with enthusiasm and energy. We'd never really toured, we'd never had an audience other than our family and friends. We ended up touring around America and Europe quite relentlessly for over two years in search of... rock and roll? By the time we sputtered, coughed and crawled our way home we were exhausted. But strangely inspired. We began writing songs for what became our sophomore effort, 'Make Yourself'. An album that when finished, evoked a kind of head scratching reaction out of us. Being that we had unintentionally helped define a new sub-genre of music with the previous one. It seemed almost counterintuitive that we had just written a rock and roll album filled with melody, restraint, thoughtfulness (both musically and lyrically), and God forbid...singles! (If this narrative had moving imagery attached, I would place a quick edit to Godzilla tearing apart a city somewhere. People running frantically in all directions and a few brave souls here and there pointing up at the fiendish, pre-historic creature from the deep.) Make Yourself was met with trepidation by our newfound listeners. We had flipped the switch on them. Pulled the old switcheroo. We even got nervous at certain points that perhaps we had made a mistake in trusting those instincts to keep moving in this more 'song' oriented direction. But a few months after its release, things began slowly arcing towards success. And I stress, slowly. Slowly but surely. In the end, our creative instincts had pointed us in the right direction. It was a meandering compass, but a good one. \n\nIf Not Now, When? is the coalescing of this slow arc. The wave that has been traveling so long, about to break. A force that is capable of both beauty and destruction, but is most noteworthy because of it's uniqueness as an event that will never occur again. Waves have broken before it, waves will break afterwards, but each one is an individual canvas. This one is ours. Yours and mine. \n\nSo, if success is a drug, then Incubus is a functioning addict. I know how trite it sounds to be commenting on our own success but I see our addiction as a collective one. You have enabled us thus far and what we are creating in the process will be worthy of conversation for a long time to come. When I say 'WE' I mean you and I. All of us. This is, after all, a conversation that started in the early 90's and has continued until today. A stroll along a winding path through many landscapes and over much terrain. Yes, our bones ache, our dogs are barkin', our shoes have holes in them, and we don't look as good with our shirts off anymore. But that doesn't mean we won't keep walking! And conversing along the way. I'd like to start thinking of success less as an opiate and more of a segue into the good parts of a conversation. \n\nSee you soon, girls and boys. We love making music and we feel blessed and grateful to have your attentions today and hopefully tomorrow!\n\nCheers,\n\nBrandon Boyd\n","booking_agent":"Variety Artists, William Morris","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Los Angeles","genre":"Rock","hometown":"California","influences":"Primus, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Mr Bungle, Beastie Boys, Alice in Chains, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Phish, Faith No More, Bjork, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeath","is_published":true,"press_contact":"REN Management","record_label":"Epic","talking_about_count":73630,"username":"incubus","website":"www.incubushq.com www.enjoyincubus.com www.twitter.com\/incubusband www.makeyourselffoundation.org http:\/\/www.myplaydirect.com\/incubus ","were_here_count":0,"id":"5509303998","name":"Incubus","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/incubus","likes":5258494,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151852833358999","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1394783_10151852833358999_1799626407_n.jpg","offset_y":13,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Direct Hits is available for pre-order: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/idirecthitsdlx | Sign Up Here: http:\/\/idj.to\/WgBzzo","bio":"Inspiration has never eluded Las Vegas' The Killers, and it's a damn good thing it hasn't, because their newest record, their third studio album entitled Day & Age, is full of their finest songs to date.  \"I think about moments when we were coming up with 'When You Were Young,' or, in this case, 'Spaceman,'\" Flowers says. \"If we'd decided at that moment, 'Let's go to the park,' they might not have happened. It's scary. It almost makes me not want to stop because I could be missing out on these wonderful songs. They're out there for the taking--you've just got to grab them.\"\n\nTogether with bassist Mark Stoermer, guitarist Dave Keuning, and drummer Ronnie Vannucci, Flowers helped to mold the album into 10 songs that work best together as a whole, each individually describing an evolution of the Las Vegas band's sound. \"We're always pushing ourselves,\" says Stoermer, \"and there's a lot of diversity here--from anthemic rock to dance songs.\"  Flowers adds: \"We felt like Sam's Town was a continuation of Hot Fuss, and we feel like this is a continuation of Sam's Town.  But at the same time, Day and Age is totally different from both of them, while still sounding like us.  It's kind of looking at Sam's Town from Mars.\"\n\nThose familiar with the band's oeuvre will recognize their signature in the synth-heavy \"Human,\" four minutes of sweeping, epic rock, on which Flowers sings: \"My sign is vital\/ My hands are cold\/ And I'm on knees, looking for the answer\/ Are we human, or are we dancer?\" He says the lyrics were inspired by a disparaging comment made by Hunter S. Thompson about how America was raising a generation of dancers. But the song also had some help from album producer Stuart Price (aka Jacques LuCont), known for his work with Madonna and Missy Elliot, and who'd previously remixed \"Mr. Brightside.\"  \"He was the icing on the cake,\" says Stoermer.\n\n\"We had just put 'Human' together, and we wound up shooting over to his house after dinner [in London],\" Flowers recalls of his first time in the studio with Price. \"A few hours later, we had something very close to what you hear now. I was on cloud nine.\" He continues: \"When we walked into his flat, the first thing I saw was picture of the cover of The Man Who Sold the World, and further down the stairs there was a picture of Eno in his Roxy Music days. I just kind of felt that we'd found our man.\"\n\nThat he'd find comfort in the signifiers of those artists shouldn't come as a surprise: The band's made no secret of their admiration for both art-rock and stadium giants (collaborating with the likes of Lou Reed, who guested on \"Tranquilize,\" a single from Sawdust, 2007's collection of B-sides, rarities, and new songs). Formed in Las Vegas in 2002, the band belongs to the lineage of high-energy rock bands that manage to be both commercially successful and critically acclaimed (both of their studio albums have received endless column inches bursting with praise), and it's almost mind-blowing to consider that without the classifieds section of a local paper, they might have never been. \n\nFlowers first met guitarist Keuning while perusing said classifieds for fellow musicians; when Dave's ad mentioned The Beatles, Oasis and more, Flowers knew he was on the right track. They claimed the name The Killers (taken from the bass drum of a fictional band in a New Order video), and eventually recruited Stoermer and Vannucci into the fold, all of them agreeing that there seemed to be an intangible something to the music they were making, as well as the response they were generating from people who saw them play.  And as these performances became bigger and bigger, and praise for the band began to spread rapidly, A&R men came from the UK and the US to see them, eventually leading them to sign with Island Records in America.  Their debut, Hot Fuss, catapulted them onto the global stage upon its 2004 release, selling millions of copies around the world.  The band toured for two years straight behind Hot Fuss, playing more than four-hundred shows, and eventually returned to Vegas to begin to work on the follow-up album with legendary producers Alan Moulder and Flood.  The result, a love letter of sorts to their hometown entitled Sam's Town, was released in 2006 and spent forty-two weeks on the Billboard Top 200.  In between all of this, the band managed to fit in two appearances on Saturday Night live, in addition to performances on The Tonight Show, The Late Show with David Letterman and more.  One might think this would produce a generous amount of pressure as the band began to work on their newest collection of songs, but this was not the case.  \"We're confident together, comfortable with the way we work as a live band,\" Stoermer says. \"So when we were writing this record, there was less anxiety, not that we're resting on our laurels.\"\n\nThis comfort in their work together is apparent on Day & Age.  The album sees The Killers experimenting with different instruments: \"I Can't Stay\" has a tropical sound--thank the saxophone and steel drums--and, as the singer says, \"could be the most perfect pop song we've ever written.\" \"Losing Touch,\" meanwhile, is a gorgeous uptempo track with bright horns and grim lyrics (\"impending doom, it must be true\/ I'm losing touch\") that lend it an ominous vibe. \"Spaceman,\" an unabashedly arena-sized glam-rock number whose associative lyrics reference, among other themes, alien abduction. (\"We've been playing it between 'Read My Mind' and 'Mr. Brightside,' and it feels like it's been there forever,\" Flowers says.)  More than anything, The Killers are excited for their fans to hear what they've been creating, though, says Stoermer, \"We're always a little nervous about whether people are going to like it.\"\n\nThe people have in the past. Besides the sales figures--including moving 4.4 million units of Sam's Town abroad--the band has received seven nods from the Grammys, and won a variety of MTV, BRIT, and NME awards. They've headlined some of the biggest festivals in the UK and Europe, including Glastonbury, the Reading and Leeds Festival and Pukkelpop, and have sold out prestigious venues such as Madison Square Garden in America.  The attention has, at times, made it difficult for them to keep their composure, but this time out the band is trying to remain more level-headed.\n\n\"We got thrown up to the position very quickly that we're in now --the test is to retain it,\" says Flowers. \"I want us to be a positive force. People think that we're overconfident and cocky, but it comes from excitement. It's not 'I'm better than you,' it's that I can't wait till you hear this song because I know what it does to me physically. I'm able to listen to our songs and not think 'this is us playing,' I'm able to allow the music to affect me and I know if it's good or not. Sometimes people think I'm running my mouth, when I'm truly excited.\"","category":"Musician\/band","is_published":true,"record_label":"Island Records","talking_about_count":51448,"username":"Thekillers","website":"http:\/\/www.thekillersmusic.com\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"35718435694","name":"The Killers","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Thekillers","likes":9184905,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152089628175695","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/539730_10152089628175695_879352959_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":50}}

Nine studio albums, hundreds of unique live performances and hundreds of official live concert bootleg releases later, the band continues to be critically acclaimed and commercially successful -- with over 60 million albums sold worldwide. \n\nOver the past twenty years, the band has remained a major force in rock and roll, as much for its aggressive loyalty to its social and political principles and restless experimentation as for its rock radio staples and bestselling albums.\n\nIn 2011, Pearl Jam celebrated their 20-year anniversary with a destination weekend in Alpine Valley, WI and toured Canada, South America, Central America, and Mexico. The band also released the film Pearl Jam Twenty along with an accompanying book and soundtrack as part of the anniversary celebration.\n\nPearl Jam released their much-anticipated tenth studio album, Lightning Bolt, on Monkeywrench Records\/Republic Records on October 15, 2013 in the US. Internationally, the album was released on October 14, 2013 and distributed by Universal Music Group International. Produced by Brendan O\u2019Brien, Lightning Bolt marks Pearl Jam\u2019s first studio album since the highly acclaimed Backspacer, which was released nearly four years ago in September of 2009.

{"about":"Acoustic At The Ryman - Available Feb 11, 2014\nPreorder on iTunes: smarturl.it\/bohaatrit","bio":"\u201cNow it\u2019s hard to remember it any other way.\u201d Band of Horses singer Ben Bridwell\u2019s compellingly evasive lyrical style will never let the listener on to the exact intent of  this line as it appears in  \u201cNeighbor,\u201d the expansive Infinite Arms album closer, but taken out of the context of the song it becomes a sentiment of currency. The present state of the band is as close to ideal as rock n\u2019 roll can be. Having assembled a true creative and personal collective, designed and signed the record deal of his dreams, and made a fantastic new album free of any influence other than his onstage brothers in arms, it's hard to imagine that Bridwell cares to dwell on any time but the present. It took nearly 2 years, virtual bankruptcy, five states and a dead falcon to get there, but Infinite Arms is the product of a band doing things on their own terms and finally learning to enjoy the results.  \n \n \tThe songs on Infinite Arms project the essence of the different locales across America that became the setting for the recording and songwriting process behind the album. The serene woods of Northern Minnesota and the band\u2019s native Carolinas inspired the songwriting, lending the compositions an air of comfort and familiarity. While those locations helped the songs come to life, the sounds were influenced by the recording settings. The rich musical heritage of Muscle Shoals, AL, the sublime beauty of Asheville\u2019s Blue Ridge Mountains, the glamorous Hollywood Hills and the vast Mojave desert helped yield the group\u2019s most focused and dynamic recordings to date.\n \n \tInfinite Arms was a group effort in the truest sense of the phrase. Trading song ideas remotely and then joining in the studio to work through arrangements led to writing credits for all five band members throughout the record,  making the album a reflection of the taste and style of each Horse.  Bridwell is the lone constant member since Everything All the Time, the band\u2019s 2006 debut, but if you ask him he might tell you that Infinite Arms is just that: a debut in the sense that he entered the studio for the first time with a group of musicians working together as a cohesive force. All members made invaluable contributions to the inimitable sound that Bridwell has crafted since the band\u2019s inception.  \n     \n \tBand of Horses is Bridwell, Creighton Barrett, Ryan Monroe, Tyler Ramsey and Bill Reynolds. The quintet have long standing ties: Monroe and Bridwell played baseball together in grade school, Ramsey and Reynolds cut their teeth in the same Asheville, NC music scene, and Barrett met Bridwell at a party as teenagers, where they bonded instantly over a mutual obsession with Dinosaur Jr. Over the course of a few years, they gradually synched up. Barrett appeared behind the kit on Cease to Begin, while Monroe joined the band on keys toward the end of the writing process of that record. Reynolds came into the fold almost by accident as he happened upon a recording session with the band at his friend\u2019s Echo Mountain Studios and joined the touring lineup soon after. Ramsey,  already an established solo artist, joined after Reynolds introduced him to the band  in 2007, starting to tour just prior to the release of Cease to Begin and opening the shows with a set of his own material. \n \nThe novelty of and high hopes for these new members demanded a completely uninhibited recording process. Anything less would have been disservice, and recognizing the most important element used to exert influence, Bridwell decided the only way to insure creative control was to finance the record himself. The result was liberating, the only dictator the creative muse . The band obeyed its every order.  Strings and horns were brought in, guitar players played percussion, vocals were run through the same reverb tanks that treated the Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d and a backyard amphibian chorus sang the title tracks\u2019 outro. Studios, engineers, pizza and whiskey are not cheap however, and near bankruptcy from recording costs prolonged the albums completion as the band had to spend time on the road to afford the next session. The resulting shows were among the best in the bands history. A sold out Carnegie Hall, epic festival sets, the now customary New Years Eve shows in Atlanta, and performances with musical idols Neil Young, Willie Nelson and Roger McGuinn kept things fresh and vibrant. The touring also helped combat studio malaise, and allowed the band to enter each recording session recharged and armed with new ideas. The thrill of honing the new material in a live setting gave the songs an edge that is difficult to capture when sedentary. \n\nWhile the band initially enlisted their long time producer Phil Ek to take the helm, scheduling conflicts led to a band decision to produce the majority of the record on their own. This unexpected occurrence added another dimension to the credence of freedom that seeped into every aspect of Infinite Arms.\n\n    \tThe freedom was not limited to the music.  The band was looking at landscape of the business with a fresh perspective as their contract with Sub Pop had expired. Armed with their finest work to date, the band began entertaining suitors in the search for the one who would understand Bridwell\u2019s vision for a new record deal. Perhaps ironically, part of this deal involved Bridwell returning in a certain fashion to his first role in the business - a label president. Predating any foray into musicianship, and completely oblivious to his talent at the time, Bridwell started Brown Records while living in Seattle. \"Brown Records came about thanks to two major factors. I had talented friends and I hated my job.\" he says. Those talented friends were a band called Carissas Wierd.\"I always considered myself their biggest fan and supporter so around this time I decided it was up to me to see that these recordings were available to any local set of ears willing to listen. I had moved up from my dishwashing position to line cook now and was making good tips, but held tons of resentment for a lot of the management, promoters, and even some bands that I was feeding every night that I felt treated me like a second class citizen, only there to cook for them and deal with their sometimes devilish moods. I retaliated by saving every shitty tip I got at the end of the night and stuffing it into a dead space in a stereo speaker. I'd have to crack the thing open like a piggy bank one day and ruin my listening environment to get it out, but for good reason. There was little doubt in my mind that the plan would work. I just didn't figure how well it would work. \" \n     \n         \"I finally cracked my speaker open one day to reveal what I would think was probably around five or six hundred dollars. This was hardly enough to press a batch of 1,000 cds at the time, so I weaseled a loan out of my father for the rest of the cash. With a wonderful crackpot team of art director Jeff Montano and mastering engineer Joe Crawford (RIP) we got all the specifics together and pulled off the remarkable feat that was BROWN 001 Carissa's Wierd 'Ugly But Honest: 1996-1999'\" A label boss was born.  Bridwell continued to release records by Carissas Wierd and other local acts including S and Aveo, and eventually joined Carissas Wierd as the band\u2019s drummer, leading the way to the discovery of his musical talent, a fortunate occurrence for his fans.  \n \n       Brown eventually became a distant priority behind Bridwell\u2019s new day job as a professional musician, but his passion for discovering and nurturing talent never left. When it came time to haggle with label suitors, he insisted on resurrecting Brown as an imprint to release the Band of Horses record through in conjunction with Fat Possum and Columbia, and to ultimately discover, nurture and release new talent , with his friends at Fat Possum handling marketing and distribution.\n \n       Infinite Arms continues the collaboration between the band and their aesthetic director Christopher Wilson. Bridwell and Wilson have a long standing friendship that dates back to their meeting in Tucson, AZ and subsequent days of washing dishes together at famed Seattle club The Crocodile. They added a professional element to their relationship when Wilson began designing Band of Horses album artwork beginning with the first record, and going on the road with the band as their photographer, while also running the projections that appear on the backdrop behind the band at each gig. An extremely talented photographer of natural landscapes, Wilson\u2019s view of the world has added the perfect visual accompaniment to the band\u2019s sound. Wilson\u2019s photographs and drawings will grace all versions of Infinite Arms, including the stunning deluxe edition which consists of the 180 gram vinyl, LP, CD, DVD featuring HD videos for every song created by Wilson and synched to a 5.1 surround sound mix by Elliot Scheiner, all packaged together in a 100 plus page coffee table book featuring Wilson\u2019s nature photographs.  \n \n      The title of the record is another Bridwellian play on words. He'll never let on to what it means, the only hint that it\u2019s a phrase possibly misheard by thousands of people every day. Dwell on that one if you want to drive yourself nuts. Or, subscribe to Bridwell\u2019s philosophy of celebrating the present and embracing the future, both of which will find Band of Horses trotting the globe as they share the fruits of their labor with the world.  \n\n\n\nRIP mike hawk\n\n\n\n","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"Charleston, SC","is_published":true,"record_label":"Columbia Records, Brown Records, Fat Possum Records","talking_about_count":8821,"username":"bandofhorses","website":"http:\/\/bandofhorses.com ","were_here_count":0,"id":"5162567788","name":"Band of Horses","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bandofhorses","likes":1155527,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151145663452789","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc1\/s720x720\/408830_10151145663452789_56633898_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"B, I, N-G-O, and Gotye was his name-O","band_members":"Wouter (Wally) De Backer","bio":"Ask Gotye about his new album Making Mirrors and he\u2019ll speak not of songs, but of sounds. He\u2019ll describe the various valves through which strings and choirs cycle on his Lowrey Cotillion, a vintage organ bought for 100 bucks in a second-hand shop that features on the record. Or how he constructed a bassline by sampling the Winton Musical Fence, an unlikely instrument he discovered in the outback of Queensland, Australia, comprised of five large metal strings attached to wooden fence posts and a resonant chamber. He may mention the horn break from a traditional Taiwanese folk song he discovered on a 1970s Cathay Pacific promotional record, which he sampled, sped up and dubbed out, before introducing it to some Turkish drum sounds. Or the unique, virtual versions of acoustic instruments - among them a chromaharp and an mbira - he created by painstakingly multisampling every note.\n\nListen to Making Mirrors and you\u2019ll be drawn in by the details, transported to a world where every moment matters. This is pop at its most precise, but also electronic music at its most emotional. The record delves into dub, Detroit-era Motown soul, stadium-size politipop, synth-folk and world music on glorious, sprawling, huge-hearted songs.\n\nGotye (pronounced Gauthier) first found fame in his native Australia with his second album, 2006\u2019s Like Drawing Blood. Radio station Triple J named it their album of the year, as did iTunes on its release in Europe in 2008. It was recently voted the 11th greatest Australian album of all time. In Britain, Like Drawing Blood became a cult hit while in the States, it made waves after Drew Barrymore fell in love with single Learnalilgivinanlovin\u2019 and used it in several of her films.\n\nMaking Mirrors, its extraordinary follow-up, was more than two and a half years in the making. To write and record its dozen sumptuous songs, Gotye moved from Melbourne to a barn on his parents\u2019 remote five hectare block on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria. There, he had the space to permanently set up his growing array of instruments and recording equipment, and found the isolation that allowed for sonic experimentation and recording at any time of the day.\n\nAfter Like Drawing Blood, which was constructed almost entirely from samples of old vinyl, Gotye set about making an album using more physical and acoustic instruments.\n\n\u201cI ended up sampling a lot of them note-by-note and turning them into virtual instruments,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a slow and sometimes laborious process, but it can completely change the sound of the instrument and how you approach playing it. You can buy so many virtual instruments online these days, but it\u2019s not nearly as personal as making them yourself. I found a beautiful old chromaharp at an antique shop, and \u2018virtualised\u2019 it in this way. It ended up sounding more like an unusual hammer dulcimer when played on a midi keyboard or programmed with software\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Gotye continued to raid local second-hand shops for obscure vinyl to sample.\n\n\u201cA lot of samples came from 1950s and \u201860s exotica records,\u201d says Gotye. \u201cGuys like Les Baxter; these amazing orchestrators and producers who experimented so boldly with musical colours and the stereo spectrum\u201d \n\n\u201cFor Bronte, the closing track on the new record, I used a sample of \u201860s orchestrator Leo Addeo. He made an exotica record called Calypso which featured lots of wildly out-of-tune steel drums. I pitched some grabs of these around, really messing with the overtones of the samples, and it became a gentle, beautiful loop, while still being quite odd sonically.\u201d\n\nGotye\u2019s background is as a drummer and often plays his shows solo, setting off samples from behind his drum kit while singing. On Eyes Wide Open, the first song recorded for Making Mirrors, he played live drums for the first time on a Gotye record. There is also live piano and bass guitar, plus some strange field recordings.\n\n\u201cI recorded sounds from around my parents block - me walking up the path, the frogs in the background \u2013 and wove them subtly in to several songs. I even included the ambience of the barn in the background of Don\u2019t Worry, We\u2019ll Be Watching You. The most obvious field recording is of the Winton Musical Fence. I played the fence strings one windy night in the outback and recorded it on a portable stereo. That became the bassline for Eyes Wide Open.\u201d \n\nThe dubby State Of The Art, with its spooky, pitch-shifted, sci-fi vocals, is an ode to the Lowrey Cotillion, with lyrics that mention its keys and functions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fascinated by how attached to certain pieces of technology we can become. I mean, I love this organ!,\u201d laughs Gotye. \u201cBut I was also interested in how these relationships don\u2019t often hold between generations. Certain pieces of gear that once captured peoples\u2019 imagination can now appear quaint and outdated to younger people. Yet those who experienced them when they were at the vanguard of technological achievement, sometimes still hold onto that glorious vision of the future they provided. It\u2019s like we inscribe our dreams on these machines sometimes; we can develop these peculiar yet profound personal relationships with them.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the joyous, uptempo I Feel Better revisits the Motown sound of Like Drawing Blood\u2019s breakthrough single Leanalilgivinanlovin.\n\n\u201cThat song was a direct response to listening to Martha Reeves\u2019 Dancing In The Street when I was driving home one day,\u201d says Gotye. \u201cI was struck by how massive the tambourine sound on the recording is \u2013 it feels like it\u2019s being hit by the hand of God. I thought it was cool that such a wall of sound could be dominated by a physically quite small instrument like a tambourine. So I arrived home, played a tambourine backbeat at a similar tempo and put an impossibly big plate reverb on it. Sitting down at the piano in response to this percussion track, I had I Feel Better written in about an hour.\u201d\n\nAlready Making Mirrors is making waves thanks to stunning, Peter Gabriel-esque, first single Somebody That I Used To Know, a collaboration with New Zealand singer Kimbra which is currently nestled in the Australian Top 10. Within three weeks of its striking, stop-frame, body-painting video being posted on YouTube, the song had received more than two million hits and made it to No.1 on the Hype Machine Twitter chart. Hear it once and you\u2019ll be haunted by it for weeks.\n\nGotye launched Making Mirrors in Australia in August with a gig at Sydney Opera House, which is followed by a tour in the autumn. For the first time, he will be playing Gotye music completely live.\n\n\u201cI have a ten-piece band, in which everyone sings and plays multiple instruments,\u201d says Gotye. \u201cThese are by far my most ambitious shows to date. There will be no backing tracks used. All visuals will be triggered live too. We\u2019ve been rehearsing twice a week for the past 3 months, and it\u2019s exciting because it\u2019s dangerous. It could go wrong on every song. I\u2019ve never been one to make my life easy.\u201d\n","booking_agent":"info\u0040lunaticentertainment.com (Aus), tom\u0040windishagency.com (North America), natashabent\u0040theagencygroup.com (UK\/Europe)","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Danny Rogers (info\u0040lunaticentertainment.com) and John Watson","genre":"Pop","hometown":"Bruges, Belgium to Melbourne, Australia","is_published":true,"press_contact":"claire\u0040bossymusic.com (Aus), jay.wilson\u0040umusic.com (US), alix\u0040wastedyouthpr.com (UK)","record_label":"Eleven (Aus), Universal (UK\/USA\/Canada\/Germany\/France), V2 (Benelux), Frequency (NZ), Hostess (Japan)","talking_about_count":9512,"username":"gotye","website":"www.gotye.com, www.soundcloud.com\/gotye, www.twitter.com\/gotye, www.youtube.com\/gotye, www.myspace.com\/gotye","were_here_count":0,"id":"9172042123","name":"Gotye","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/gotye","likes":1892977,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151159855872124","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/380635_10151159855872124_275771204_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"'The Greatest Hits' Album Available Now: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/3DDGreatestHitsiT","band_members":"Brad Arnold : Vocals\nChris Henderson : Lead Guitar\nGreg Upchurch : Drums\nChet Roberts : Guitar\nJustin Biltonen : Bass","bio":"If rock \u2018n\u2019 roll had fairy tales, the 3 Doors Down story would be one of the most popular. Their story begins in childhood, it celebrates friendship, honesty and making the most of God-given talents. It\u2019s about faith in your teammates and collaboration, trusting instincts and, once success is achieved, lending a hand to help others.\n\nThey made their mark early, selling 6 million copies of their debut album, and rather than allow that moment to define themselves, they have developed as musicians, songwriters and friends. The stories and emotions related in their songs resonate with audiences: Their music and lyrics are as approachable as the guys in the band.\n\n\u201cThe main thing is the lyrics,\u201d says Brad Hardin, a radio programmer in Tampa, Florida, at one of the first stations to play 3 Doors Down's music. \u201cI've watched them mature as a band. They work hard, they do anything for their community and they're so sincere and easy to be around. And that comes out in their music.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to make this life make sense\u201d is a line from one of 3 Doors Down\u2019s most popular songs, \u201cAway From the Sun\u201d and in many ways it sums up a key attraction to the band\u2019s work: The directness of Brad Arnold\u2019s lyrics. \n\n\u201cSomething I have always tried to do when writing a song: Talk about something besides the rims on the car, something somebody can identify with, but make it open-ended so a listener can make it adapt to their own life,\u201d he says.\n\nThat open-ended element is one reason their music has been used to promote every major sports league from college basketball to hockey, they have connected with the military in consistent and meaningful ways and their foundation takes care of children in need.\n\n3 Doors Down has a great relationship with radio stations and when Billboard printed its Top 100 Pop Songs, 1992-2012, the band was represented twice in the top 25. \u201cHere Without You\u201d was No. 8 and \u201cKryptonite\u201d was No. 25 on a list based on Top 40 radio airplay.\n\nThey have had a few changes in their lineup, Chet Roberts replaced founding member Matt Roberts on guitar in 2012 and Puddle of Mudd's Greg Upchurch became the permanent drummer in 2005. \n\nKen Fermaglich, who has booked the band since they signed a deal with Universal Republic in 1999, says success has not changed them as people. \u201cA lot comes back to their down-to-earth, loveable quality. They\u2019re very loyal guys.\u201d \n\nTheir story begins in Escatawpa, Mississippi, a town of fewer than 4,000 residents located 35 miles east of Biloxi. Brad Arnold and Matt Roberts played tee-ball together as kids, remaining teammates as their hobby moved from baseball to music.\n\nWith Roberts on guitar and Arnold on drums, they created a three-piece while in middle school. One of the local high school bands featured guitarist Chris Henderson and bassist Todd Harrell and eventually they joined forces to create 3 Doors Down and developed a following in the Biloxi area, mixing originals and covers of Pearl Jam, Metallica and Bush.\n\nOnce they had a following, the band recorded an EP at Lincoln Recording Studio in Pascagoula. \u201cWe weren\u2019t trying to get a deal,\u201d Arnold remembers, \u201cjust make a record.\u201d\n\n\"Kryptonite\" was played in a radio ad to promote a 3 Doors Down gig, which caught the ear of the operations manager at WCPR in Biloxi, Kenny Vest, who promptly added \"Kryptonite\" to the station\u2019s rotation.\n Vest would later connect the band with a management company, McGathy Promotions, and a label, Republic Records. Universal Republic A&R executive Tom Mackay remembers being mystified by the intensity of their fan base, but wondered why it was so limited to such a small area. \n\n\u201cIt was the spring of 1999,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand we would call record stores and radio stations to see what was going on locally. When we called Biloxi the reports we would get back were so over the top it was unlike anything we had ever seen.\u201d\n\nAt WCPR, \u201cKryptonite\u201d was No. 1 for 15 weeks. Monte Lipman, who founded Republic Records with his brother Avery in 1995, found that astonishing. \u201cFriends and family can make enough calls for a song to hit No 1 for a week, but this was unheard of,\u201d he says. \n\nThe second place \u201cKryptonite\u201d caught fire was WXTB in Tampa, Florida, a station that was among the first in the country to play music by Creed, Matchbox Twenty and Collective Soul. Operations manager Brad Hardin heard the EP and played it for his staff, whose reaction was as enthusiastic as his own.\n\n\u201cWe happened to have a slot open that week and said let's put it in,\u201d Hardin says, noting that it is a rarity for any station to add music from an unsigned band that is not locally based. \u201cThe request lines blew up.\u201d\n\nMonte Lipman was the first label head to get to Mississippi to meet with the band and wound up booking them a New York showcase at CBGB. \u201cThey were pretty bad,\u201d Lipman remembers. \u201cBrad can laugh at it now, but we knew they could be taught to be good performers. I felt that we heard four hit songs that night.\u201d\n\nThey went into the studio to record the songs that would become \u201cBetter Life,\u201d working on them first in local studio before meeting up with producer Paul Ebersold.\n\n\u201cThere was a deer in headlight effect,\u201d Arnold says. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t done that little recording we would have been so lost when we went into the studio. At least we had a little bit of understanding. Paul Ebersold was the perfect person to be our producer. Paul wouldn\u2019t scare us, but he made it clear \u2013 \u2018this is your shot. You have to get it right this one time.\u2019\u201d\n\nBased on the response, they got it right. \u201cThe Better Life,\u201d released in February 2000, was certified six times platinum and a new version of \"Kryptonite\" peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Airplay Chart for six weeks. In 2000, it was the 11th best-selling album of the year and \u201cKryptonite\u201d would be named the No. 1 song for the year at all of radio\u2019s rock formats and secure a Grammy nomination. \n\nArnold remembers the day he wrote it and heading to Harrell\u2019s place to practice with Roberts. Harrell walked through the room on his way to take a shower and Roberts tried playing what Arnold was singing. \u201cAnd Todd sticks his head out the door with a big wad of soap in his hair and yells what is that?,\u201d Arnold remembers. \u201cThat\u2019s a hit.\u201d \n\nWhile \"Kryptonite\" led the way, \"Loser\" and \"Duck and Run\" became international hits: \u201cLoser\u201d topped Billboard\u2019s Mainstream Rock chart for 21 weeks and \u201cDuck and Run\u201d followed it with a three-week run at No. 1 on that chart. BMI presented Arnold, in 2002, the award for songwriter of the year.\n\nHardin saw the band perform in Tampa at the radio station's festival Livestock. \u201cSeeing 20,000 people sing 'Loser' when it hadn't been on the radio that long made me realize they had something special,\u201d He says. \n\n3 Doors Down, which had opened shows for Creed, quickly became a headliner and word got out that the band delivered a strong live show. Success and the roadwork took a toll.\n\n\u201cReality set in,\u201d Chris Henderson says. \u201cWe had been on the road for two years and the label wanted another record. We wanted a break. We\u2019d almost forgotten how to do it. No one liked anyone\u2019s stuff, we weren\u2019t ready to work yet,\u201d a sentiment expressed in the title track of the second album \u201cAway From the Sun.\u201d \n\n\u201cAway From the Sun\u201d immediately went gold, peaking at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, and \u2013would eventually go four times platinum. The biggest of its four hits was \u201cWhen I\u2019m Gone,\u201d a song adopted by the military as it hit No. 1 at Top 40 and Mainstream Rock and No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. \n\n \u201cThere are only a few songs we\u2019ve written on the road and \u2018When I\u2019m Gone is the only hit we\u2019ve written on the road,\u201d Harrell says. \u201cWe were playing it in Europe and could immediately tell it was something special. From day one, it got the crowd up. I always knew it would do well.\u201d\n\nBy the time of their third album, \u201cSeventeen Days,\u201d anticipation ran high for its release as evidenced by its debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 and the single \u201cLet Me Go\u201d landed in the top 10. The album title referred to the number of days it took to write the songs.\n\n\u201cThe difference in five years was amazing,\u201d Arnold says. \u201cI was 25 or 26 and it was a lot to take in. About that time, some marriages and relationships were starting to crumble a bit. \u2018Seventeen Days\u2019 was so full of emotion.\u201d\n\nConsidering the band's emotional state, Arnold laughs when he talks about the album's biggest hit, \"Let Me Go,\" about a break-up. \u201cI wrote it for 'Spider-man 2.' It\u2019s funny,\u201d Arnold says, \u201cbecause it also had meaning to me personally.\u201d \n\nFor their fourth album, 3 Doors Down used the band\u2019s name for its title and debuted at No. 1 when it was released in May 2008, hitting gold within a month. \u201cIt's Not My Time,\u201d the second song Arnold wrote a for a movie (\u201cPoseidon\u201d) that wasn\u2019t used, topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for three weeks. The fifth studio album, \u201cTime of My Life,\u201d debuted at No. 3 when it was released in July 2011. \n\nIt was the first time the band had reached outside the group for a co-write on a song. \u201cUsing outside songwriters gave us a fresh twist,\u201d Arnold says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be repeating ourselves as songwriters.\u201d\n\nThree new tracks appear on this \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d album, \u201cOne Light,\u201d \u201cGoodbyes\u201d that Arnold wrote after a friend passed away, and \u201cThere\u2019s a Life.\u201d\n\nChris Henderson explains \u201cOne Light\u201d as song that points out \u201ceveryone is looking for the leader to get behind so that change can begin.\u201d Arnold adds: \u201cIt\u2019s about giving the world more than you can take from it.\u201d\n\nIt could also be a description of 3 Doors Down\u2019s Better Life Foundation that they founded in 2003 to help children in need of food, shelter and medical attention. \u201cEvery time we do something with our foundation or for the military, we\u2019re just the catalyst,\u201d Arnold says. \u201cWhen I leave an event, I feel like I have been given something. We\u2019ve been able to do a lot of good things, so it\u2019s hard to look at it as giving back.\u201d\n\nBrad, Todd and Chris all agree they have created a family by being in a band together. They left Mississippi for Nashville and still live just a few miles from one another and share their lives onstage and off. 3 Doors Down is a brotherhood of rock \u2018n\u2019 rollers whose bonds with each other and their fans only grow stronger with age. \n\n\n\nPhil Gallo\nOctober 2012\n\n\n\n","booking_agent":"Ken Fermaglich - The Agency Group","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Red Light Management","genre":"Rock","hometown":"Escatawpa, Mississippi ","is_published":true,"record_label":"Republic\/Universal Records","talking_about_count":44801,"username":"3DoorsDown","website":"http:\/\/www.3doorsdown.com\/ http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/3doorsdown","were_here_count":0,"id":"6639618181","name":"3 Doors Down","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/3DoorsDown","likes":5576729,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151809856343182","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1457605_10151809856343182_1693137266_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"artists_we_like":"Sebastien Tellier, SebastiAn, Kavinsky, Ratatat, Phoenix, Alan Braxe, DJ Falcon","band_members":"Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo\nThomas Bangalter\n","bio":"Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met on the grounds of their lyc\u00e9e in Paris in 1987. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums. The indie rock trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition. Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom.[8] Bangalter felt that \"The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it.\" A negative review in Melody Maker subsequently dubbed the music \"a bunch of daft punk.\" Instead of dismissing the review, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo found it to be amusing.[4] As the latter stated, \"We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly.\" Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix.[5] Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers.\nIn 1993 Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings. The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, \"The New Wave\", a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of \"The New Wave\" called \"Alive\".\nDaft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record \"Da Funk\". It became their first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of \"Da Funk\", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. They had no trouble finding one at the time as they chose Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype night clubs. The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which they licensed their tracks to the major label through their production company, Daft Trax. \"Da Funk\" and \"Alive\" were later included on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework. The album was regarded as an innovative synthesis of techno, house, acid house and electro styles, and is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential dance music albums of the nineties. The most successful single from Homework was \"Around the World\", which is known for the repeating chant of the song's title. Daft Punk also produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D.A.F.T. - A Story about Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes.\nBy 1999 the duo were well into the recording sessions for their second album, which had begun a year earlier. 2001's Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood.[8] This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album. It reached #2 in the UK, and its single \"One More Time\" was a major club hit, creating a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles \"Digital Love\" and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" were also very successful in the UK and on the U.S. dance chart, and \"Face to Face\" hit #1 on the U.S. club play charts despite a limited single release. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, entitled Alive 1997.\n2003 first saw the release of the feature-length animated film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, whom they have said is their childhood hero. The album Daft Club was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name.\nStarting on September 13, 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to creating new material. The duo released the album Human After All in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were \"Robot Rock\", \"Technologic\", \"Human After All\" and \"The Prime Time of Your Life\". The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was \"we believe that Human After All speaks for itself.\"\nA Daft Punk anthology CD\/DVD entitled Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 was released on April 4, 2006. It contains new music videos for \"The Prime Time of Your Life\" and \"Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)\". Daft Punk also released a remix album of Human After All called Human After All: Remixes. A limited edition included two kubricks of Daft Punk as robots.\nOn May 21, 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, Daft Punk's Electroma at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight. The film does not include their own music, which is a first for the duo considering their previous DVD and film releases (D.A.F.T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for Discovery). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007. Initial public comments have since been positive.\nDaft Punk released their second live album titled Alive 2007 on November 19, 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris from their Alive 2007 tour. The album includes a 50-page book showcasing photographs shot while on tour. The live version of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" from Alive 2007 was released as a single. A music video for the single directed by Oliver Gondry features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island.\nThe highly anticipated original motion picture score for TRON: Legacy, composed and produced by Daft Punk, will be released by Walt Disney Records \/ EMI Music on Monday, December 6 2010.","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"Paris, France","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Kathryn Frazier \u0040 Biz 3","talking_about_count":75123,"username":"daftpunk","website":"http:\/\/www.daftpunk.com\/ http:\/\/www.daft-musique.com\/ http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/daftpunk http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/daftpunkalive ","were_here_count":0,"id":"22476490672","name":"Daft Punk","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/daftpunk","likes":10985004,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152032828960673","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/563660_10152032828960673_297194391_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The official Bon Iver Facebook page.\nhttp:\/\/boniver.org","bio":"First it was 'For Emma, Forever Ago.' The soul in a refraction of icicles. A moment hanging like breath on air. And yet life \u2013 even still life \u2013 is not still. The story is not a story if it does not unravel. Your eyes you may cast backward, but the heart is locked in the chest and must beat forever forward. Bon Iver, 'Bon Iver' is the frozen beast pressing upward from a loosening earth, one ear cocked to the echo of the ghost choir still singing, the other craving the martial call of drums tumbling, of thrum and wheeze. The desolation smoke has dissipated, cut with strips of brass. Celebration will not be denied, the cabinet cannot contain the rattle, there is meat on the bones.\n\nIt's there right away, in the thicker-stringed guitar and military snare of \"Perth,\" and \"Minnesota, WI.\" Anyone who had a single listen to For Emma will peg Justin Vernon's vocals immediately, but there is a sturdiness \u2013 an insistence \u2013 to Bon Iver, 'Bon Iver' that allows him to escape the cabin in the woods without burning it to the ground. \"Holocene\" opens with simple finger-picking. The vocal is regret spun hollow and strung on a wire. Then the snare-beat breaks and drives us forward and up and up until we fly silent through the black-star night, our wreckage in view whole atmospheres below. The vocals in \"Hinnom, TX\" ease to the muffled depths, while the instrumentation remains sparse and cosmic. \"Calgary\" is a worship song to everything 'For Emma' mourned, and at the point in the final track \"Beth\/Rest\" when Vernon sings, \"I ain't livin' in the dark no more\" it is clear he isn't dancing in the sunshine, but rather shading toward a new light.\n\n\"Bon Iver is often equated with just me,\" says Vernon, \"but you are who surrounds you, and for Bon Iver, 'Bon Iver' I wanted to invite those voices as musical catalysts.\" Thus on the track \"Beth\/Rest\" and throughout the album, we hear the pedal steel of Greg Leisz (Lucinda Williams, Bill Frisell), the uniquely layered low end of Colin Stetson's (Tom Waits, Arcade Fire) saxophones, the riffing of Mike Lewis' (Happy Apple, Andrew Bird) altos and tenors, and the lush horns of C.J. Camerieri (Rufus Wainwright, Sufjan Stevens). Bon Iver regulars Sean Carey, Mike Noyce and Matt McCaughan contributed vocals, drums and production, Rob Moose (Antony and the Johnsons, The National) helped with arranging and added strings, and fellow members of Volcano Choir, Jim Schoenecker and Tom Wincek provided processing.\n\nBon Iver, 'Bon Iver' was recorded and mixed at April Base Studios, a remodeled veterinarian's clinic located in rural Fall Creek, Wisconsin. The main recording space is constructed over a defunct indoor pool attached to the clinic. \"It's an unique space and destination; it's our home out here,\" says Vernon, who purchased the structure with his brother in late 2008 with the sole intention of converting it into his ideal recording studio. \"It's been a wonderful freedom, working in a place we built. It's also only three miles from the house I grew up in, and just ten minutes from the bar where my parents met.\" The creation of Bon Iver, 'Bon Iver' was a three-year process, and Vernon says the completion of the studio paralleled the completion of the album. \"I was writing and recording in the windows of time snatched between tours in support of 'For Emma,'\" he says. \"When I finally came home to hunker down for a solid stretch there was a feeling of solid ground and an opportunity for liberation waiting in the space for me.\"\n\nIn the absence of solid ground, the whirlwind becomes a whirlpool, and Bon Iver, 'Bon Iver' is Justin Vernon returning to former haunts with a new spirit. The reprises are there \u2013 solitude, quietude, hope and desperation compressed \u2013 but always a rhythm arises, a pulse vivified by gratitude and grace notes, some as bright as a bicycle bell. The winter, the legend, has faded to just that, and this is the new momentary present. The icicles have dropped, rising up again as grass.\n\n- Michael Perry\n\n","booking_agent":"NA: adam\u0040billions.com \/ UK: rob\u0040codaagency.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Minnesota, WI","general_manager":"boniver\u0040middlewestmgmt.com","hometown":"Eau Claire, WI","is_published":true,"press_contact":"lucy\u0040jagjaguwar.com","record_label":"Jagjaguwar","release_date":"June 21, 2011","talking_about_count":5135,"username":"boniverwi","website":"www.boniver.org\nwww.twitter.com\/boniver\nwww.twitter.com\/blobtower","were_here_count":0,"id":"90738729415","name":"Bon Iver","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/boniverwi","likes":1757543,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151913207944416","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1157427_10151913207944416_1540345106_n.jpg","offset_y":69,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Ocean Avenue Acoustic, the album & tour http:\/\/moment.yellowcardrock.com\/","band_members":"Ryan Key \u2013 vocals, guitar\nSean Mackin \u2013 violin, vocals\nRyan Mendez \u2013 guitar, vocals\nLongineu Parsons III - drums\nJosh Portman - bass\n","bio":"Getting an opportunity to make an impact by playing music is a dream for many bands. But getting a second chance, according to Yellowcard frontman Ryan Key, is a blessing.\n\nYellowcard returned to the spotlight in 2011 after a three-year hiatus with the energized When You\u2019re Through Thinking, Say Yes. The album was a renaissance of sorts for the Jacksonville natives, as its 10 tracks played out like the band never spent any time apart. A logical progression from 2007\u2019sPaper Walls, the group managed to capture elements of its entire discography with the album, which was welcomed by patient fans and praised by critics alike. Say Yes inspired a winding nine months of touring that took the band to over 30 different countries, a world tour that served as a reconnection with old, diehard fans and an instant way to reach new, younger listeners.\n\n\u201cThe tours we got to do last year, the bands we got to tour with, were incredible,\u201d Key says. \u201cWe wanted to stay current and matter to younger fans, because making new fans is important to us, and at the same time, we didn\u2019t want to turn our back on our old fans because they\u2019re essential to our existence. We couldn\u2019t make new fans without our old ones? When you\u2019re at a Yellowcard show if you\u2019re not a fan, you look at someone who is and think, \u2018Why am I not a fan of that? Why am I not enjoying this like that person is? I want that.\u2019 That\u2019s amazing for us.\u201d\n\nThe extensive touring schedule in support of Say Yes was more inspiring than exhausting. The band that put out the acclaimed Ocean Avenue (2003) nearly a decade ago, and fan favorites Lights and Sounds (2006) and Paper Walls (2007) after that, was still feeling energized and ready to move. \u201cWe got back from tour and we were still so excited about doing this,\u201d Key says. \u201cWe wanted to keep the ball rolling.\u201d So Key, violinist Sean Mackin, guitarist Ryan Mendez, new bassist Josh Portman and drummer Longineu Parsons decided to head back into the studio with almost no time off to record a new album.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re better at balancing the band and our personal lives than we have ever been before, and part of that comes with being 30 years old and not 20,\u201d Key says of the band\u2019s desire to keep its momentum going. \u201cWe all want to work together more than we ever have, and that\u2019s what drove us back together after being away from each other for three years.\u201d The decision to get back into the studio so soon brought along some pressure at first, but Key says that was all self-induced. \u201cAfter a while, we decided, \u2018This is what we do. We know exactly what we\u2019re doing, let\u2019s sit down and write some music.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe resulting album, titled Southern Air, will be Yellowcard\u2019s sixth studio effort and second for Hopeless Records. And according to Key, it was the easiest writing and recording experience of the band\u2019s decade-plus long career. He describes a \u201cbrotherhood\u201d that he shared with Mendez, Mackin. LP, and long-time producer \n\nNeal Avron during the meat of the recording sessions. \u201cThere was this bond, this camaraderie, a positive energy in the room,\u201d Key recalls in a hushed tone. \u201cWe all got so excited about every part of every song, working with each other on everything.\u201d More passionate than ever before, Yellowcard churned out a holistic effort as the self-induced pressure evaporated from the songwriting.  \n\nThe album\u2019s title provides a loose concept for the album, centering around the experience Key had while Yellowcard was on its hiatus. Moving back to Athens, Georgia, to spend more time with his family than he had since his high school years gave Key some perspective into what his priorities are. \u201cI think this record, in a lot of ways, examines how much better that time made my life, how much of a positive influence that had on me,\u201d Key says, \u201cand how much I know now that I need that in my life, that southern air.\u201d\n\nThe rocking title track certainly hits home on that concept, with Key rounding out the album by singing, \u201cThis southern air is in my lungs, it\u2019s in every word I\u2019ve sung \/ It seems the only truth I know, this will always be home.\u201d Musically, Yellowcard\u2019s pounding pop-punk sound is abundant (\u201cAwakening,\u201d \u201cRivertown Blues\u201d), while of course highlighting the trademark violin, especially in first released song \u201cAlways Summer.\u201d Southern Air has every essential element of past Yellowcard albums, but at the same time still feels fresh and new. It could very well be the band\u2019s best work, and it\u2019s because of an intangible feeling you get when you listen to it.\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s hard to answer that question, which I think is our best,\u201d Key says. \u201cBut I really think there\u2019s something special about this record. And I don\u2019t necessarily mean how many copies it\u2019s going to sell or anything like that, I just think there\u2019s something special here and I hope people see that too.\u201d\n\nNot bad for a band trying to make the best out of a second chance.","booking_agent":"Corrie Christopher - APA","category":"Musician\/band","description":"Follow us! http:\/\/twitter.com\/yellowcard http:\/\/twitter.com\/williamryankey http:\/\/twitter.com\/smackinyc http:\/\/twitter.com\/longineu http:\/\/twitter.com\/ryanmendez http:\/\/twitter.com\/joshportman","hometown":"We started our band in Jacksonville, FL.

{"about":"www.swedishhousemafia.com","artists_we_like":"Eric Prydz, Tinie Tempah, Dirty South, Lady Gaga, The XX, Gorillaz, AN21, Max Vangeli, Alex Metric","band_members":"Axwell, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso","bio":"It\u2019s three forty five in the morning when SWEDISH HOUSE MAFIA \u2013 AKA Steve Angello, Sebastian Ingrosso and Axwell - descend on the DJ booth at their Masquerade Motel night (at Ibiza\u2019s legendary Pacha) and drop their undisputed Summer anthem \u2018One\u2019. Now signed to Virgin Records and powered by a suitably smooth soul vocal from Pharrell Williams, the roar of approval for \u2018One\u2019 is so loud that it\u2019s as if they\u2019ve just stepped out onto the stage at Wembley. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s a tune so immense that they have no choice but to play it again at the end of the night. Zane Lowe, Pete Tong, Erick Morillo \u2013 it seems there isn\u2019t anyone in the electronic scene who hasn\u2019t been knocked out by the power of \u2018One\u2019. \n\n \u201cThe whole season has been absolutely unbelievable,\u201d say house Mafioso Steve Angello, who\u2019s never backwards in coming forwards with sound bites. \u201cWe\u2019re competing with the biggest nights on the island and now we\u2019re one of the biggest \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen Pacha like that before. This year everybody came through and it\u2019s been an incredible experience.\u201d \nAs for the party, we can\u2019t help but notice that this Motel is full of the same raw energy you\u2019d normally see at a rock show \u2013 only for these clubbers, \u2018One\u2019 really is the new \u2019Teen Spirit\u2019. \u201cWe did the track in LA together,\u201d explains Sebastian Ingrosso. \u201cWe actually thought we wouldn\u2019t do a track together but after \u2018Leave The World Behind\u2019 with Laidback Luke did so well, we decided to make a track and it came out great.\u201d Amazingly, the whole shape of \u2018One\u2019 came together in just two days. Not bad for a record that Beatport has proclaimed the fastest-selling number one download single of all time. \u201cTwo days!\u201d laughs Seb. \u201cWe had the idea and arrangement done and after that we were bouncing it back and forth for one day. The concept was simple: we had an idea of looping a kick-drum into a bassline but I said it needed a crescendo of in your face melodies.\u201d But let\u2019s rewind a little. We all know that \u2018One\u2019 is the record that\u2019s flipped the script but there are so many other questions we need to be answered.\n\nFor example, how did these Swedes meet? Who gave them their name? And are they really direct descendants of the mafia?  \u201cMe and Seb met when we were six or seven: we got into all kinds of trouble together!\u201d laughs Steve. \u201cSeb\u2019s Dad had a label called Plumphouse and we got into music and did all kinds of weird things including lounge compilations and made music for shows. I even did music for a Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden\u2026\u201d So Team Angello and Ingrosso had been working together for quite some time. \u201cWe bumped into Axwell ten years ago now, when he was doing stuff on [the house label] Sulphuric,\u201d says Steve. \u201cWe got in touch \u2013 we were younger than him \u2013 and we just clicked.  We all learned from each other because we were young kids. Also, when it came to the music, Me and Seb were more rough. I don\u2019t tweak a hi-hat for six hours!\u201d And then there was fellow Swede Eric Prydz, who together with Steve created the CR2 smash \u2018Woz Not Woz in 2004. \u201cWe all hung out like friends and started building a relationship. But no-one would give us shows \u2013 we had to beg nightclubs to put us on! We begged them to let us play for one hour and everyone loved it. But since no one would touch us, that\u2019s why we worked so hard at the start. After that, me and Ax did Supermode (the Communards-sampling \u2018Tell Me Why\u2019 on Data) and me and Seb did a couple of records as Buy Now. We never got the support \u2013 until now.\u201d\nThe dynamic of the three and their collective history is the key to the Mafia\u2019s continued success. \u201cIt\u2019s been one hell of a ride,\u201d nods Steve. \u201cWhen the name \u2018Swedish House Mafia\u2019 first popped up, it wasn\u2019t something we focused on straight away. People called us that on forums back in the day. But we\u2019ve been through everything together. I can always lean on one of their shoulders and they can lean on mine. I can always trust their opinions. when I have a track, they tell me straight away what they think. With Swedish House Mafia, you\u2019re with friends\u2026.\u201d \n\nEverybody knows that Axwell, Steve and Sebastian are separate entities: they all have their own record labels (Axtone, SIZE and Refune respectively) and they all have separate lives and individual concerns. But as the success of their recent sell-out Brixton Academy shows and the growing success of Masquerade Motel will testify, it\u2019s what they achieve collectively and as a unit that makes for the most magic. Axwell has already been giving this subject some thought. \u201cSwedish House Mafia is a monster of its own. We\u2019ve tried to control it and seen it as a bonus but the truth is, it just won\u2019t go away. I call it \u2018IT\u2019! When we work together, shit happens. It\u2019s a machine that has a certain electricity that\u2019s much stronger than anyone else. Let\u2019s see where it takes us.\u201d Last summer, the Swedes weren\u2019t together as often as they\u2019d hoped but the demand and collective success has dictated that the Mafia must now meet almost every single week. \u201cThis Summer \u2018IT\u2019 will be more often than last Summer because we are having such an amazing time. Last year we all lived in Ibiza and we got to hang out quite a bit. But now Steve and I have kids, it will be structured hanging out time.\u201d Ingrosso looks at the three of them as bringing different elements to the house music table: \u201cSteve has his underground beats, Axwell is more melodic and I\u2019m more somewhere in between,\u201d he reasons. \n\nAs Axwell points out, one thing has changed since The Early Days: Steve and Ax are now proud parents while Sebastian is left holding the proverbial baby and keeping an eye on the grown-up kids he\u2019s known since school. Has it made things harder or easier, we wonder? \u201cEASIER!\u201d blasts Axwell back. \u201cI think that your kid creates that balance.  But the reward is so massive, even travelling to Oz for thirty hours it\u2019s worth it. When you\u2019re travelling or in the studio, your time is limited so you make the most of it.\u201d\n\nAnd what of Masquerade Motel, the Ibiza home of the Mafia? It\u2019s a club concept that\u2019s been picking up plaudits since the season begun. Is it a similar vibe to last year or different, we wonder? \u201cI hope that it\u2019s not too different,\u201d says Axwell. \u201cIt\u2019s just faster and more polished and we\u2019re drinking more gasoline. I guess that the difference with Ibiza is it\u2019s our second year so we have some routine and experience. The first year is about building your crowd so hopefully we can harvest some fruits from the crop we planted last year. I think we\u2019re more relaxed. As for the club, it\u2019s an intimate party vibe \u2013 we want you to feel like you\u2019re a part of a private after-party.\u201d\n\nThe other thing that\u2019s changed is Swedish House Mafia have signed a 360 deal with Virgin\/EMI. As they all acknowledge, it\u2019s a Big Deal. Ingrosso again: \u201cit\u2019s a long term commitment and they\u2019re involved in gigs and live shows as well as the music. SHM is bigger than any of us \u2013 and we needed a serious partner to control it and that\u2019s what they do.\u201d But who and what have Virgin\/EMI signed exactly? It\u2019s three people, three producers and three pairs of eyes and ears perfectly aligned together. And the deal is a huge step forward for dance music and DJ culture suggesting that major labels are showing faith in electronic music again. Their next single \u2018Miami 2 Ibiza\u2019, meanwhile, will feature Tinie Tempah. Axwell again: \u201cI\u2019m so pleased about this. It\u2019s so nice to be a part of something that\u2019s bigger than yourself. We all have our solo careers but this excites people on a different level.\u201d\n\nSo life is looking good for the Mafia right now. \u201cWhat we do: it\u2019s a show,\u201d reasons Seb. \u201cLook at Brixton: it\u2019s a show. People want confetti and they want to get something out of it. You can\u2019t just DJ and look at your shoes! Now dance music is really big and we have an opportunity to take this further.\u201d But we\u2019ll leave it to Axwell to have the final word as he\u2019s in a particularly thoughtful place at the end of the interview. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a lovely job to DJ and produce and share the passion for music that we have. It\u2019s pretty simple and very natural. We\u2019re not a manufactured thing \u2013 we\u2019re musical brothers.\u201d\n","category":"Musician\/band","category_list":[{"id":"180164648685982","name":"Bands & Musicians"}],"checkins":53,"current_location":"Sweden","general_manager":"amy\u0040atmartists.com","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","zip":"","latitude":55.855160798,"longitude":-4.23679294382},"record_label":"Virgin Records","talking_about_count":49046,"username":"swedishhousemafia","website":"http:\/\/www.onelasttour.com http:\/\/www.swedishhousemafia.com http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/swedishhousemafia http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/swedishousemfia http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/axwellofficial http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sebingrosso http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/steveangello","were_here_count":0,"id":"69448024527","name":"Swedish House Mafia","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/swedishhousemafia","likes":6268406,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151511449409528","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/24638_10151511449409528_1639706981_n.png?lvh=1","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Welcome to the Official Good Charlotte Facebook Page.  Download \"Cardiology\" on iTunes here: http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/album\/cardiology\/id396114877  www.goodcharlotte.com","band_members":"Joel Madden: Vocals\nBenji Madden: Lead Guitar\/Vocals\nBilly Martin: Guitar\/Keyboards\nPaul Thomas: Bass\nDean Butterworth: Drums","bio":"From the opening sounds of GOOD CHARLOTTE\u2019s fourth album Good Morning Revival -- which launches with an artful, innovative sound collage that slides into the irresistible \u201cMisery\u201d-- it\u2019s evident that the world-famous band who\u2019ve sold over nine million albums has revolutionized its sound for 2007. And by the time the optimistic parting shot \u201cMarch On\u201d rolls around, it\u2019s evident that this is the vibrant, adventurous and unexpected rock album that has redefined the group. \n\nReturning to work with producer Don Gilmore (Pearl Jam, Linkin Park, Avril Lavigne) -- who helmed Good Charlotte\u2019s eponymous 2000 breakthrough debut -- was the decisive change that reinvigorated the band. After a pair of successful albums like 2002\u2019s tremendously popular triple platinum The Young and the Hopeless and 2004\u2019s subsequent million-selling follow-up The Chronicles of Life and Death (which were realized with producer Eric Valentine), GC singer Joel Madden says its modus operandi on Good Morning Revival (Epic\/Daylight) was simply to \u201cmake a record that we loved and that felt good.\u201d \n\nIn an effort to achieve that goal, Gilmore challenged Joel and his identical twin, Good Charlotte\u2019s guitarist Benji Madden, to bring their A game. And he was highly critical. \u201cWe threw out 50 or 60 songs and pretty much started over,\u201d Benji says. \u201cDon was like, \u2018I want to reinvent you guys. I want people to ask themselves, \u2018Is that Good Charlotte?\u2019\u201d \n\n\u201cWe wanted to love every track,\u201d bassist Paul Thomas explains. \u201cOur goal this time out was to make it an awesome listen straight through. No fucking filler, man.\u201d\n\nFor the Maddens, who -- unlike their bandmates Paul, guitarist\/keyboardist Billy Martin and new Good Charlotte drummer Dean Butterworth -- had become fixtures of the paparazzi-addled L.A. nightclub scene as well as prominent DJs, the opportunity to ship up to Vancouver to create new music was absolutely necessary and remarkably fruitful.\n\nThe first day in British Columbia the Maddens had the bulk of \u201cVictim of Love,\u201d the contagious harmony-laden rock & roll song, down. \u201cWe knew we were onto something,\u201d Joel explains. And literally every day it was like we were writing a new song. After two months in Canada, isolating ourselves and getting away from everything that we were comfortable with was amazing. We came away with most of what you hear on this record.\u201d\n\nBy the time the group officially hit the studio with Gilmore, the downtime between its last tour and its official reconvening was as therapeutic as it was motivational. \u201cThe fact that we were able to stop, take a deep breath and kind of find some appreciation for all that we\u2019ve accomplished has a lot to do with why this record sounds as vital and electrifying as it does,\u201d says Martin. \u201cWe used to just take every offer that came our way and we\u2019d never get much in the way of downtime. Now that we\u2019ve had that time off it feels like a new band in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nOne of the album\u2019s highlights is its first single: the blistering, unforgettable rocker \u201cThe River,\u201d an impassioned song about sin and redemption that traverses the dark side of Los Angeles. For the song, the band brought longtime friends and fellow musicians M. Shadows and Synyster Gates (of Avenged Sevenfold) into the mix, marking the first time Good Charlotte has officially collaborated with another artist on an album. It turned out to be a natural fit for both bands. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been friends with Avenged for a longtime. This wasn\u2019t planned, but it ended up working out,\u201d Joel explains. \u201cWe were sitting around listening to some new music and they liked that song so we asked them to jump on. It felt right and sounded really cool. Aside from being friends of ours, we\u2019re also fans of their music and since this is our first collaboration, we couldn\u2019t be happier that they\u2019re a part of our record.\u201d\n\nGood Morning Revival sustains its momentum with tracks like the fuzzy, club-driven \u201cDancefloor Anthem\u201d and the genre-defying, Gorillaz-like You Tube favorite \u201cKeep Your Hands Off My Girl\u201d (which was introduced to audiences on the band\u2019s U.S. fall 2006 tour and will be the lead single in Europe, Asia and South America). Good Charlotte has proven that it can thrive in a number of musical realms. \n\n\u201cHonestly, the first time I heard it, I was like, \u2018Are you fucking kidding me? People will never know that\u2019s a Good Charlotte song,\u201d concedes Billy. \u201cAnd then Joel\u2019s like, \u2018Well, that\u2019s the point!\u2019 But soon enough it had me in its clutches.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird,\u201d Joel says. \u201cThat song takes a lot of balls. I know some people will listen to it and probably think, \u2018No thank you.\u2019 It\u2019s definitely not as if we sat down and penned a piece of art. It\u2019s kind of like a sarcastic take on the whole club scene.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, on the hard-charging dance beat-steered rocker, \u201cMisery\u201d -- in which the singer observes the \u201ctacky, plastic, shallow, empty\u201d people that distinguish the City of Angels -- the keyboards are really pronounced. While the gorgeous \u201cA Beautiful Place,\u201d which evokes strains of Travis, The Beach Boys and the Flaming Lips, asserts that Good Charlotte is as much of a bona fide pop band and serious chart contender as it is a techno group or a punk quintet.\n\n\u201cI wrote that song in Mexico,\u201d Benji says of \u201cA Beautiful Place.\u201d \u201cI was down there during hurricane season and I was in this beautiful beach environment. I had a night off and I was just thinking about how lucky I\u2019ve been. \u201cThat\u2019s a real Dean [Butterworth] moment. It was different when we wrote it, but then Dean started playing that real pronounced drum part. The drums are part of the hook. And it changed the whole sound.\u201d \n\nSpeaking of new vibes, the ups and downs of relationships propel rock anthems like \u201cBreak Her Heart\u201d and the opposites attract tack of \u201cSomething Else.\u201d These songs, along with the tender, melodic ballad \u201cWhere Would We Be,\u201d find Joel -- who recently ended a lengthy, highly-publicized relationship with a certain movie star -- putting his feelings out there for public scrutiny. \u201cI\u2019m sure people are going to say these songs are about this or that,\u201d he admits. \u201cLove is a big part of me and I\u2019ve accepted that and it\u2019s in my music. And I\u2019m not afraid to just show it.\u201d \n\nSuch honesty coupled with success and personal growth couldn\u2019t help but inform Good Morning Revival. \u201cThis record shows a lot more of us than anything we\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d Benji says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s hard to be an angry kid, all mad at the world when you\u2019ve got it so good. I mean, that angst will always be there for Joel and I because of the way we grew up. Our father wasn\u2019t the best role model as people know. But I definitely have a moment every day where I go, \u2018Wow. What a rad life.\u2019 I look at myself as being really blessed.\u201d\n\nTo which Joel adds, \u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster ride for us in our own little way. We were up, then we kind of went down a bit. But now we\u2019re up again. I think our new record has really been as much about looking back as it is about moving forward. We\u2019ve realized a lot, and I\u2019m really grateful that we\u2019re still doing what we love.\u201d \n\nRevitalized and inspired, Good Morning Revival finds Good Charlotte at its creative pinnacle\n","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"Waldorf, MD","is_published":true,"record_label":"EMI","talking_about_count":8481,"username":"goodcharlotte","website":"www.goodcharlotte.com\n\u003C\/br>\nwww.twitter.com\/goodcharlotte\nwww.myspace.com\/goodcharlotte\nwww.youtube.com\/gchomevideos","were_here_count":0,"id":"6850496602","name":"Good Charlotte","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/goodcharlotte","likes":3455461,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150595924616603","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/428027_10150595924616603_2078545406_n.jpg","offset_y":29,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"PRISM Out NOW: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/PRISM\nFeaturing \"Roar,\" \"Unconditionally,\" \"Dark Horse feat. Juicy J,\" \"Walking on Air\" and more!","band_members":"Katy Perry","bio":"When Katy Perry was a fourth grader, her teacher asked the class to make a \u201cvision board\u201d \u2014 a collage of images cut out from magazines that represents the dreams and aspirations you hope to manifest in life. The year was 1993 and Selena had just won a Grammy Award, so nine-year-old Katy chose a photo of the young Latin pop singer holding her golden statuette. Fifteen years later, Perry has been nominated for her first Grammy Award in the \u201cBest Female Pop Vocal Performance\u201d category for her ubiquitous No. 1 single, \"I Kissed a Girl,\" from her platinum Top 10 album One of the Boys, and has been chosen as this year\u2019s My GRAMMY\u00ae Moment artist.  Current sales check in at over 2 million albums and more than 13 million tracks, singles and mobile product globally.\n\n\u201cI found my vision board when I moved apartments recently,\u201d says Perry, now 24. \u201cI knew where I wanted to be even as a young kid. I just didn\u2019t know that if I put one foot in front of the other, I would actually get there someday.\u201d \n\nPerry\u2019s willful determination, not to mention her songwriting and vocal talent and larger-than-life charisma, have led to an astonishing year for the saucer-eyed, raven-haired pop starlet, who, with her cheeky sense of humor and sexy pin-up girl style, was \u201cthe breakthrough star of 2008\u201d as Blender magazine put it in the issue that featured Perry on the cover. \n\nYou could say it all started in April 2008 when Madonna told Ryan Seacrest that Perry\u2019s \u201cUr So Gay\u201d (off her November 2007 EP of the same name) \u2014 a withering kiss-off to a metrosexual ex \u2014 was her favorite song. \u201cIt may have been a small comment on her behalf, but it was a large comment in my world,\u201d Perry recalls. \u201cIt was like a big boat leaving the dock and getting a champagne send-off.\u201d Shortly after being anointed by the Queen of Pop, Perry released her debut single \u201cI Kissed A Girl\u201d \u2014 a provocative ode to the beauty of women that ruled radio over the summer of 2008, becoming an all-format hit and shooting to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 where it stayed put for seven straight weeks and tied The Beatles\u2019 Capitol Records record for weeks at No. 1. The video was nominated for five MTV Video Music Awards, including a nod for Perry for \u201cBest New Artist\u201d and became the No. 1 most viewed music video of 2008 on MySpace. A No. 1 airplay smash in 22 countries and the 2009 People\u2019s Choice award winner for \u201cFavorite Pop Song,\u201d \u201cI Kissed A Girl\u201d has sold more than six million tracks worldwide. Its popularity also made Perry a ripe target for Fox News commentator Bill O\u2019Reilly, who convened a panel of hand-wringing analysts to discuss the effect of the song on America\u2019s impressionable youth. Perry was also voted \u201cBest New Artist\u201d by readers of Rolling Stone and PerezHilton.com\n\nOn June 17, 2008, EMI Music released One of the Boys, a witty romp through Perry\u2019s brightly colored world that showcases her sharp, candid lyrics, big voice, and feisty, girl-power swagger, as well as her appealing vulnerability on songs like her latest single, \u201cThinking Of You.\u201d \u201cI think people can appreciate a songwriter who shows different sides,\u201d she says. \u201cThe whole angst thing is cool, but if that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got, it's just boring. Everything I write, whether it\u2019s happy or sad, has a sense of humor to it.\u201d Case in point: the album\u2019s spunky, high-voltage second single \u201cHot N Cold,\u201d which became Perry\u2019s second No. 1 single and international hit, selling nearly three million digital tracks since its release. The eye-popping video, with its hilarious wedding theme, became the No. 2 most-viewed premiere of all time on MySpace, proving to armchair critics and naysayers that the success of this irrepressible young woman in the satin onesie and fishnets was no fluke. When Saturday Night Live spoofed her, it was official: Katy Perry was a bonafide cultural phenomenon. \n\nSo why does Perry think that she\u2019s connected with a mass audience when the road to stardom is littered with the failed dreams of aspiring wannabes? \u201cBecause I\u2019m just myself,\u201d she says, \u201cand that\u2019s all people want. People want to hear artists who are themselves, but who do interesting things and sing about them in an interesting way that maybe they have tried to conceive but couldn\u2019t. I get a lot of girls who come up to me and say, \u2018When I heard \u2018Thinking of You,\u2019 I felt that way to a T, but I never knew anyone who could put my feelings into words.\u2019 I think that\u2019s why people find me relatable. Plus, anybody can meet me. I\u2019m not distant. I\u2019m very much the same person I was before the hit singles. I just have a schedule for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\u201d\n\nFans do seem to respond to Perry\u2019s approachable girl-next-door quality (if the girl next door were a self-described \u201cglamour ninja\u201d), perhaps because it\u2019s not an act. The middle child of two pastors, Perry grew up singing in church. \u201cMy dad would give me ten dollars, which is a lot of money when you\u2019re nine, to sing at church, on tables at restaurants, at family functions, just about anywhere,\u201d she says. Perry was raised on a strict diet of church music; \u201csecular music,\u201d as her mother called it, was \u201cnot allowed.\u201d But one night during a slumber party, Perry happened upon a Queen record \u201cand the heavens opened and saved me,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom then on, they have been my biggest influence. Their musicality and lyrics were so flamboyant and real. I\u2019d never heard anything like it.\u201d\n\nBy the time she was 15, Perry was determined to pursue a path in music. She spent some time in Nashville working with professional songwriters \u2014 \u201cthese seasoned country music vets who had been writing songs for forever\u201d \u2014 and honing her own songwriting skills. \u201cEvery single one of my songs is drawn 100 percent directly from my life.\u201d At 17, Perry met legendary producer and songwriter Glen Ballard, who spent years guiding and developing her talent and songwriting. The strength of the songs and Perry\u2019s full-throated voice captured the attention of Capitol Music Group, which signed her in Spring 2007. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot of highs and a lot of lows in this business,\u201d Perry says. \u201cBefore I got signed, it was tough.

{"about":"The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus","artists_we_like":"Too many....","band_interests":"Music, Love, sk8 boarding\/surfing, Life","band_members":"RONNIE WINTER - VOCALS, STUDIO DRUMS\nJOEY WESTWOOD - BASS\nRANDY WINTER - GUITAR\nMATT CARTER - LEAD GUITAR\nJOHN HARTMAN - PERCUSSION","bio":"TOUR DATES \u0040 REDJUMPSUIT.COM\nPRESS \/ MANAGEMENT = RJAPRESS\u0040YAHOO.COM\nBOOKING = jordan\u0040eta-live.com UK ed\u0040primary.uk.com\n\nBIOGRAPHY\nThe Red Jumpsuit Apparatus is a Faith driven punk rock\/post hardcore band who strives to show people the light in a world of dark through music.....\n\n\nIt all started with two brothers and two acoustic guitars. This is the TRUE story, strap yourself in its quite a ride.\n\nthe Back Story\n\nRonnie and Randy began playing music together when they were 7 and 8 years old. Grandpa Gene came home from a yard sale and said \"Here ya go learn how to play these it's fun.\" they started learning to play by ear and eventually formed a band called RAFM (radio active fungus monkeys) with Randy's friend Roger. They played together a couple years then split up. Ronnie met Jesse Carroll in drivers Ed and they became good friends over their love of punk rock. Ronnie playing drums joined Jesse's band called Burnout and they played house shows and small concerts together for about a year then decided to start a fresh new band. They recruited Randy as lead singer and formed a Christian metal band called Dishonest. This band played shows all over the southeast for the next 4 years and recorded 2 EPs as well as developing a solid Florida fan base.  Ronnie began experimenting singing and writing songs in a more punk\/post hardcore fashion the first one being called Kins and Carroll. \n\nThe birth of the Jumpsuit Appatrati........\n\nRonnie asked Randy and Jesse if they wanted to start a new project and they decided to pass so Ronnie recruited friends from his High School (Middleburg High School) to start playing his songs. Many friends came and went over the next year but Ronnie Winter and Duke Kitchens pushed through all the changes and finally settled down with Elias Reidy and Joey Westwood. At first Ronnie was still playing drums but then asked local drummer Jon Wilkes to play his parts so he could sing. The rest as they say is History....\n\nThe Virgin Years\n\nThe RJA signed a deal with Virgin Records on October 27th 2005 and made their debut album with award winning producer David Bendeth titled Don't You Fake It. They spent the next 2 years touring that album all over the world filming 4 music videos and having 2 singles chart on radio \"Face Down\" and \"Gaurdian Angel\". Things were good.\n\nLonley Road\n\nVirgin records went through a phase of re-structuring and most of if not all of the people involved with DYFI were fired or quit. This left the band at a home that was empty to all things jumpsuit. They decided to record another record with Virgin and settled with Howard Benson as producer. The album was finished and shortly after guitarist Elias Reidy left the band to be replaced by Duke's friend Matt Carter. Then band filmed two videos and again toured the world with the single \"You better Pray\" charting on rock stations all over the US. Virgin records again went through another restructuring and this time the band had \" finally had enough\". The band was offered a new 360 deal by Virgin and respectfully declined thus making them Independent in February of 2010.\n\nThe Hell or High Water EP \n\nSignaling their departure from Virgin the band released a self recorded EP produced by frontman Ronnie Winter that received great applause from old RJA fans and new alike. The band returned to their signature sound and style with no restrains crossing religious and sonic boundaries at will seamlessly integrating the fans to their new collective vision. Things were starting to look up again for the RjA.\n\nAm I the Enemy\n\nThe band paired with the collective sounds to record and release their 3rd full length album Am I the Enemy which reached number 6 on the Independant charts and left most fans amply satisfied with the new spiritual and sonic direction. Josh Burke was added on Lead guitar and Ronnie's brother Randy took the helm on rhythm to properly recreate the guitars recorded with producer John Feldmann. \nJosh Burke (lead guitar) met the band at a show in his hometown, Syracuse, NY when he was 16 years old, as just a fan. Ronnie needed a ride to the nearest guitar center to get some gear, so Josh and his father gave him a lift. It was here where Josh was able to show Ronnie just what he could do. The two decided to keep in contact. After keeping in touch and writing songs with Ronnie over the next year, Josh, now 17, was offered his first gig with RJA after the departure of Duke Kitchens and Matt Carter at Summerfest in Milwaukee, WI  with only three days to fly to Florida and rehearse. The show went great and Josh has been a member ever since.The band also decided to keep Ronnie(Ronnie has always written the drum tracks) as the studio drummer when Jon Wilkes left and decided to use touring drummers to keep things fresh and exciting in the drums department. The new line up has remained ever since. With direct Biblical references in both singles \"Reap\" and \"Am I the Enemy\" the band has begun their new journey and they ask.....\"Will you Join Us?\"\n\n\n\n","booking_agent":"Jordan Cocklin : jordan\u0040eta-live.com UK : Ed Sellers ed\u0040primary.uk.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Everywhere","description":"Ham, we have bad grammer.","general_manager":"RJA MANAGEMENT : RJAPRESS\u0040YAHOO.COM","genre":"HAHAHAHA","hometown":"Middleburg, FL","influences":"See above","is_published":true,"press_contact":"rjapress\u0040yahoo.com","record_label":"Lonley Road","talking_about_count":29962,"username":"redjumpsuitapparatus","website":"http:\/\/redjumpsuit.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"107159332655487","name":"Red Jumpsuit Apparatus","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/redjumpsuitapparatus","likes":1147837,"cover":{"cover_id":607744465930302,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1375944_607744465930302_995634211_n.jpg","offset_y":57,"offset_x":0}}

I love the number 13. I was born in December on a Christmas tree farm. I like imagining what life was like hundreds of years ago. I have blurry eyesight. My favorite thing in life is writing about life, specifically the parts of life concerning love. Because, as far as I'm concerned, love is absolutely everything. \n\nI'm easily excited, thrilled, scared, and shocked. I'm 22 now, but I never stopped jumping up and down when something wonderful happens. My biggest fear is getting bad news. Or, letting someone down. I really love showing people what I meant when I wrote a song, so my shows are very theatrical. I knock on wood constantly. I have a cat named Meredith. She's named after my favorite character on Grey's Anatomy, and she's fantastic. I live in Nashville, a magical land where 99\u0025 of the people are friendly and courteous drivers who let you in and don't honk at you.\n\nI go into a trance when I'm in an antique store. I don't like it when something or someone turns out to be different than what you originally thought. Like when you're shopping and you find a really cute dress, only to realize it\u2019s actually a strange jumpsuit situation. But I mostly don't like it when it happens with people. I love my friends and I'm always making new ones. I don't really think you can ever stop making new friends or learning about as many new things as possible. I also don't think you should ever take life so seriously that you forget to play. \n\nMusic has taken me all over the world, but the fans are the reason it's been so magical. I'm so blown away by how nice they are to me. It's strange to feel so understood by such a large group of people, but I love it. For the last two years, I've been working on an album called Red. I called it that because of the tumultuous, crazy adventures in love and loss that it chronicles. In my mind, when you experience love that's fast paced and out of control and mixes infatuation, jealousy, frustration, miscommunication, and all of those lovely emotions\u2026 In retrospect, it all looks red. \n\nI can't wait for so many things. But mostly I can't wait to see you, whether it's in a crowd or a coffee shop. Thank you for listening, showing up, reading, and taking such good care of me.\n\n--Taylor","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Country","is_published":true,"record_label":"Big Machine Records","talking_about_count":1409263,"username":"TaylorSwift","website":"http:\/\/www.taylorswift.com http:\/\/www.bigmachinerecords.com\/taylorswift","were_here_count":0,"id":"19614945368","name":"Taylor Swift","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TaylorSwift","likes":51044853,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151858250300369","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1460966_10151858250300369_1267623714_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Dot, would become acquainted with the harsh realities of the world. Sheltered by no means, the emcee was exposed to a lifestyle commonly adopted in the inner city. However, this exposure didn't influence his character in a way that on-lookers would expect. WIth the wisdom from his father, Kendrick had a balance in his life that many of his childhood peers were missing. It is this balance that is responsible for his untold story of \"Good Kid, Mad City,\" the life of young black males trying to escape the influences of Compton.   During his upbringing, Kendrick was constantly surrounded by an eclectic range of music. Lending his ear to R&B masters such as the Isley Brothers as well as Hip-Hop legends like Tha Dogg Pound, which helped prepare him for the opportunities that would one day arise in the music industry.  At age 16 Kendrick released his first mixtape Y.H.N.I.C., creating a buzz in his hometown and garnering the attention of TopDawg Entertainment's CEO. From then on, Kendrick worked to perfect his skill under TopDawg, releasing four new projects in a five year span; Training Day, No Sleep Till NYC, The Kendrick Lamar EP and his most recent project The Kendrick Lamar OD which received praise from some of the most respected online music sources. Additionally, he has released multiple tracks under the group name Black Hippy with fellow TopDawg counterparts Jay Rock, Schoolboy Q and Ab-Soul. Through these efforts Kendrick was able to showcase to the world his unparalleled ability and humorous word play.  Kendrick's handwork and unmatched talent has allowed him to work with a wide range of respected music vets such as The Game, Lil Wayne, Snoop Dogg, Little Brother, Jay Rock, DJ Quik, Scott Storch and Cool & Dre.   He is currently working on his debut album, and alongside legendary producer Dr. Dre on his highly anticipated upcoming release Detox.","booking_agent":"Zach Iser (ICM) - ziser\u0040icmpartners.com","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Dave Free","is_published":true,"personal_interests":"Human Music","talking_about_count":104491,"username":"KendrickLamarmusic","website":"www.topdawgmusic.com - www.twitter.com\/kendricklamar ","were_here_count":0,"id":"241273033091","name":"Kendrick Lamar","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/KendrickLamarmusic","likes":3342159,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151263748573092","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/199580_10151263748573092_2117491539_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Find out when Skillets coming to you!","band_members":"John Cooper, Korey Cooper, Seth Morrison, Jen Ledger","bio":"Skillet recently made headlines when their last album, Awake, became one of just three rock albums to be certified platinum in 2012, forming an improbable triumvirate with the Black Keys\u2019 El Camino and Mumford & Sons\u2019 Babel. The news that Skillet had sold more than a million albums in the U.S. came as a shock to all but the band\u2019s wildly diverse horde of fans, male and female, young and old\u2014known as Panheads\u2014whose still-swelling ranks now officially number in the seven-digit range. This remarkable achievement was announced just as Skillet was putting the finishing touches on their eagerly awaited follow-up album, Rise (Atlantic\/Word). \n\nUnwilling to stand pat or rest on their laurels, the band\u2014lead vocalist\/bassist John Cooper, guitarist\/keyboardist Korey Cooper (John\u2019s wife), drummer\/duet partner Jen Ledger and lead guitarist Seth Morrison, making his first appearance on record with Skillet\u2014continue to explore new terrain on Rise, expertly produced by Howard Benson, who previously helmed the mega-successful Awake. Eager for new challenges, Cooper threw himself into collaborative songwriting to a far greater degree than ever before, co-writing the uplifting title song and the lacerating first single \u201cSick of it\u201d with Scott Stevens, founder\/leader of the L.A.-based Exies, while teaming with Nashville songsmiths Tom Douglas and Zac Maloy on the timely and anthemic \u201cAmerican Noise,\u201d which Cooper considers to be the strongest song Skillet has yet recorded. On \u201cAmerican Noise\u201d and the joyous \u201cGood to Be Alive,\u201d the band explores new stylistic territory, bringing an element of heartland rock into their aggressive, theatrical approach. The band expanded their musical palette, integrating natural, acoustic instruments like accordion, mandolin, dulcimer, harp, tympani and bells to their trademark slashing electric guitars, strings, churning synths and pummeling drums. \n\nIt isn\u2019t just the songs themselves that make Rise so gripping, it\u2019s also the song sequences\u2014like the radical contrast between the almost unbearable tension of \u201cSick of It\u201d suddenly giving way to the ecstatic release of \u201cGood to Be Alive,\u201d or the way the closing three-song progression of \u201cMy Religion,\u201d \u201cHard to Find\u201d and \u201cWhat I Believe\u201d builds to a thrilling musical, thematic and emotional crescendo. Clearly, these songs and the album as a whole are embedded with an impassioned overarching message. This message courses with a tidal pull through Skillet\u2019s entire body of work, but on Rise, it\u2019s artfully woven into a gripping coming-of-age narrative. This sprawling work stands as the band\u2019s first concept album\u2014though it wasn\u2019t premeditated. \n\n\u201cThe narrative idea happened after we had 10 or 11 of the songs chosen,\u201d Cooper reveals. \u201cAs we were recording them, we started to realize that there\u2019s something going on here\u2014this album is really telling a story. Realizing that, I knew we needed to make it as powerful as we could.\u201d The result is a wildly ambitious work as heady as it is visceral.\n\n\u201cRise is the story of a typical American teen coming into adulthood and facing the massive world problems,\u201d says Cooper, who is deeply concerned about the erosion of belief in young people today, as well as their deeply felt desire to belong. \u201cFacing world problems as an adult is different from when you\u2019re growing up and under someone else\u2019s care. All of a sudden, you realize that the world is a dangerous place. It\u2019s dark and scary, there\u2019s acts of God happening, there\u2019s war, there are all these terrible things, and you thinking, \u2018How can I have hope in this place?\u2019 But at the same time, you also think, \u2018Even moving all those huge problems aside, I look at my own life and I\u2019m not even comfortable with the things I can change. I\u2019m fighting with my parents, my parents have split up, I\u2019m here in this home getting yelled at all the time that I\u2019m never gonna be good enough, and I\u2019m starting to believe that I\u2019m never gonna be good enough. I constantly fail myself, and I just want to have a reason to live. I want to matter, and I want to know that my life counts for something.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cSo the story is basically about rising up out of your downtrodden life, rising up from that place where you feel like a failure, rising up to be comfortable being yourself, to stand up for what you believe in,\u201d Cooper continues. \u201cIt\u2019s not about pleasing your friends, it\u2019s not about doing what\u2019s cool; it\u2019s about being who you are and being comfortable with that. And lastly, in the grand scheme of it all is, if I can be somebody I am comfortable being, maybe I can even rise up and help change the world. Can one person make a difference? Can one person actually matter?\u201d \n\nBut there\u2019s another key distinction between Rise and the band\u2019s previous albums. \u201cWe've written songs about issues, but the reason this record stands out so much to me is that this is the first time that we're singing songs that use the word \u2018we\u2019 rather than \u2018me,\u2019\u201d Cooper points out. \u201cIt\u2019s not just my feelings, these are our feelings. We can do this. Even the title track is not about me rising, it\u2019s about us rising. So this record feels inclusive of all kinds of people, and that\u2019s unique for us. It\u2019s a rallying cry.\u201d\n\nOn Rise, then, the message is both spiritual and social, as Skillet reaches out anew to its ever-growing, ever-changing following. \u201cI think music should be bringing people together and bringing them hope,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThat\u2019s what music does for me.\u201d\n\n\n","booking_agent":"APA\/ JRA","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Nashville, TN","description":"Fan mail\/Inquires: Skillet\u0040Skillet.com\n","general_manager":"Q Management Group","genre":"Rock","is_published":true,"press_contact":"B|W|R Public Relations\/ The Media Collective","record_label":"Atlantic","talking_about_count":37860,"username":"skillet","website":"www.skillet.com www.twitter.com\/skilletmusic","were_here_count":0,"id":"6483988719","name":"Skillet Music","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/skillet","likes":4650068,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151557716673720","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/1017190_10151557716673720_163131752_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Their songs curl like a sleeping dragon around the foothills, soar between the skyscrapers, and slouch in the shadows of forbidden offramps and skid row.\n\nNow, three years after their second record, Silversun Pickups are currently in Topanga, CA, working on their highly anticipated new record, Neck of the Woods, with producer Jacknife Lee (U2, Weezer, REM, Snow Patrol). The record will be released on May 8, 2012 on the band\u2019s longtime home, Dangerbird Records.\n\nSilversun Pickups have sold over 1 million records worldwide. Their first EP, Pikul, was released in 2005. While it hinted at great things to come, no one was quite prepared for the explosion of the band\u2019s debut LP, Carnavas. Released in 2006, the record peaked at #81 on the Billboard Top 200 and was the #1 Alternative and Independent record for four consecutive weeks. The fantastic single, \u201cLazy Eye,\u201d peaked at #4 at Modern Rock. In 2009, SSPU followed up with the equally powerful Swoon. That record debuted at #7 on the Billboard Top 200 and was in that chart for over 22 weeks on the strength of the #1 Modern Rock smash, \u201cPanic Switch.\u201d On November 25, 2011, they released the limited edition Seasick 10\u201d to support independent retail.\n\nSilversun Pickups came of age in Los Angeles\u2019 multicultural, bohemian enclave, Silver Lake, where the members learned to overcome their fears through playing in the organic network of clubs and bars that birthed Beck and Elliott Smith. \n\n\u201cWhen we were starting out, we were too shy to turn up the volume.

Things were changing fast.\u201d \n\nAfter two-plus years of touring, the band returned home to a different place than they had left. \u201cIt was a dark time when we got back.

{"band_members":"David Draiman- Vocals\nDan Donegan- Guitar\nMike Wengren- Drums\nJohn Moyer- Bass","bio":"Multi-platinum Chicago quartet Disturbed\u2019s new album, Asylum will be released August 31st via Reprise Records.\n\nSince their 2000 breakout debut The Sickness, front man David Draiman, guitarist Dan Donegan, drummer Mike Wengren and bassist John Moyer have been infecting heavy metal with hit singles like \"Stupify\" and \"Down with the Sickness.\" Their previous three albums\u2014Believe (2002), Ten Thousand Fists (2005) and Indestructible (2008)\u2014each debuted at Number One on Billboard's Top 200, making Disturbed one of only six rock bands in history to have three consecutive releases debut at Number One. The band has sold in excess of 11 million records worldwide and had eight No.1 singles at Active Rock Radio. Smash hit \"Inside the Fire\" garnered the band their first Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance in 2009. All of these accomplishments have set the stage for Disturbed to open their Asylum.\n\nDisturbed began building Asylum as soon as they got off the road in the summer of 2009. Officially entering Groovemaster Studios in February 2010, the band set about self-producing the album, as they did with Indestructible. Draiman declares, \"This record shows a certain degree of maturation and enhanced complexity. Asylum is still identifiably Disturbed, but the evolution is clear. It preserves the elements of what we do but at a more advanced level.\"\n\n\"We took our signature foundation, and we tried to build on that,\" adds Donegan. \"For every album, we've pushed ourselves even more than in the past. Asylum is no exception.\"\n\nThere's a duality to the title that encapsulates a thematic thread for Draiman. \"The immediate connotation of the word Asylum is the image of a mental hospital or sanitarium, but it's also meant to be a haven or a safe place,\" says the singer. \"The dual meaning of the word pushed things over the edge for me. The title track itself deals with the memory of a lost love driving you. You're not able to let go of that memory and it brings you to the point of insanity. At the same time, that memory is a safe place for you; it's a haven you go to when times are tough. Overall, this record is a reflection of that.\"\n\nFirst single \"Another Way to Die\" is classic Disturbed, blending a syncopated riff with a hypnotic hook. Donegan reveals, \"Thematically, the song's about global warming and how the choices we make affect the planet. It's a new topic for us, and it'll hopefully raise a little awareness.\"\n\nStorytelling remains a central component of Asylum. About \"Animal\" Draiman states, \"That song is huge. It's written about someone who is an actual werewolf, and it's inspired by films like Underworld and Wolfman. It's about someone who enjoys the power and lives for the transformation.\u201dAt points, the lyrics become nearly cinematic in scope. Draiman goes on, \"All of the songs deal with dramatic elements such as pain, loss, suffering and remorse. There are no flowery subjects here. The lyrics on this record are a lot less cryptic than they've been in the past. They're far more direct. I felt it was time for me to write like that. Some of these subjects required that approach, and these songs tell stories.\"\n\nNot only did the band tread new territory lyrically on Asylum but also musically. Their first instrumental track \"Remnants\" ignites the album intensely. Donegan divulges, \"We've never done a pure instrumental piece before. Our plan was to start the album that way and build anticipation with something fresh. The vibe sets everything up perfectly.\"\n\nThen there's \"The Infection,\" which will no doubt be a crowd favorite. From its percussive stomp to the wah-pedal solo, the song feels like it could derail, but it's forged together by Disturbed's focused fire. \"It's one of those tracks that makes you feel like getting in the car and going over 100 mph,\" laughs Donegan. \"It's got a cool driving groove and an extended lead.\"\n\n\"This is a statement for us,\u201d says Draiman. \u201cWe've never strayed from our identity. Disturbed records are always going to be rhythmic and powerful. They're always going to deal with the darker side of things. They're always going to be records you can take with you for a little bit of inspiration. That will forever be a common theme with every one of our records.\"\n\nThe frontman concludes, \"We want fans to walk away from this record with strength and release. That's exactly what Asylum's supposed to be. Hopefully, this is an album for people to deal with the insanity of today's times; it's another piece of music to help get you through the chaos and madness of the world in which we live.\"\n\n\u2014 Rick Florino, June 2010","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Heavy Metal","hometown":"Chicago, IL","is_published":true,"record_label":"Warner Bros\/Reprise Records","talking_about_count":140315,"username":"Disturbed","website":"http:\/\/www.disturbed1.com http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/disturbed http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/disturbedtv http:\/\/twitter.com\/Disturbed http:\/\/team.disturbed1.com http:\/\/twitter.com\/DAVIDMDRAIMAN http:\/\/twitter.com\/DanDoneganGtr http:\/\/twitter.com\/MikeWengren http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MikeWengrenOfficial http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/JohnMoyerBass","were_here_count":0,"id":"7916037383","name":"Disturbed","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Disturbed","likes":10513102,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150658785572384","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/423994_10150658785572384_1509564706_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"LIGHTNING on iTunes (US): http:\/\/bit.ly\/Lightning_iTunes","affiliation":"Matt and Kim (official page)","bio":"For many bands, making music is all about the routine of recording an annual album, or being able to tour in progressively bigger venues.  Not Matt and Kim.  \"Our goal is to make music we want to hear,\" says Matt Johnson, who co-founded the band with Kim Schifino. \"When it comes time to make a new album, I'm just so excited, since I know we have all these ideas and I just want to get them out there.\"  As for the band's extra-emphatic live shows, which these days happen in large venues, he explains, \"We've always just really enjoyed playing music, and things have kept growing.\" \n \nMatt and Kim's enthusiasm comes across loud and clear on the band's new album, Lightning, its most diverse and developed to date.  From the relentless drive of \u201cNow\u201d to the dance-fueled beat of \u201cLet\u2019s Go\u201d to the more contemplative \u201cTen Dollars I Found,\u201d Lightning is the strongest distillation yet of Matt and Kim\u2019s unique sound: a spunky hybrid of indelible songs, an emphatic beat and almost tangible energy, mixed with the duo\u2019s influence of listening nonstop to Top 40 Hip-Hop and pop-punk.\n \nTo make the album, Matt and Kim spent six months working in their home studio in Brooklyn, producing the record themselves. Lightning is a touch more minimal than their earlier work \u2013 with layers taken away, instead of added, enabling its intense performances and memorable tunes to really come to the forefront. \u201cWhat\u2019s made the songs on this album really strong is we\u2019ve been able to pull a lot off \u2013 to not have so much going on \u2013 and still have a strong song,\u201d Kim explains.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to make a song with a lot going on,\u201d Matt adds. \u201cIt feels very safe. It\u2019s like putting on a lot of clothes: you feel all covered up so no one can judge just one aspect of it, but when you try to break it down to be as simple as can be, you\u2019re really baring it all.  When you can see clearly what\u2019s going on, those are the times that the songs are easiest to connect to.\u201d\n \nConnecting with their audience is certainly a key focus for Matt and Kim.  The indie dance duo\u2019s live shows \u2013 which are legendary for constant, in-your-face exuberance \u2013 feel more like vibrant, sweaty loft parties than traditional concerts, for both audiences and the band. \u201cI think we\u2019ve managed to continue to make them feel intimate,\u201d says Matt. \u201cWhen we first started playing venues instead of playing on the floor at parties, we tried hard to keep the vibe of \u2018we\u2019re all doing this together and having a wild time\u2019 going.  The show is not just the two of us: it\u2019s the 3002 of us, or however big the venue is.\u201d  Or, as in the words of Rolling Stone: \u201cMatt and Kim\u2019s reputation as a live act precedes them \u2013 and justifiably so. Simply put, they are a two-person dynamo, frantic, tightly wound, and full of good cheer. Their performances are as physical as they are musical. . . . For sheer adrenaline-per-second, no other band comes close.\u201d\n\nThe band started in 2004, essentially by accident when Matt and Kim were art students at the prestigious Pratt Institute, where they studied film and illustration, respectively.  When Kim wanted to learn to play drums and Matt (who'd been in bands before) was getting his head around a new keyboard, the band was born. Since then, they have earned a Gold Record for the upbeat, stick-in-your-head track \"Daylight,\" played festivals like Coachella, Lollapalooza, and Bonnaroo, along with international festivals like V (U.K), Pukkelpop (Belgium), Fuji (Japan), Big Day Out (Australia), Primavera (Spain), Oya (Norway), SWU (Brazil), as well as hundreds of shows. They have won 3 MTV awards: a Breakthrough Video Music Award and mtvU Best Video Woodie Award for \u201cLessons Learned\u201d, as well as a 2011 award for Best Live Band. Lightning is the band's fourth album, following Sidewalks, Grand, and their self-titled debut.\n \nMatt and Kim have always been inspired by Brooklyn\u2019s general urban din as well as the area\u2019s artists, yet Matt points out, \u201cI don\u2019t think a place can define a person. We simply write songs about us and our life so that\u2019s why where we live comes up.\u201d\n \nIndeed, there\u2019s something universal about a song with a beat that grabs you, with a great melody, played by a band that simply loves to play music.  And that, in Williamsburg and way beyond, is the key to the universal appeal of Matt and Kim.\n","category":"Musician\/band","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Brooklyn","state":"NY","country":"United States","zip":"11211"},"record_label":"FADER Label, Liberator Music (Australia\/New Zealand)","talking_about_count":5479,"username":"mattandkim","website":"http:\/\/www.mattandkimmusic.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"7687097690","name":"Matt and kim","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mattandkim","likes":386181,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151052465047691","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc1\/s720x720\/420387_10151052465047691_54428062_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

We began in August '04 with friends, jangly guitar, hand claps, and a Harmony amp in a storage room atop Mulberry Street restaurant in downtown Fullerton, CA.

Slipping and swaying into alleyways and juke joints of yesteryear. Tapping in to the American dustbowl and British maritime.

After the bridge, why don\u2019t you do a breakdown and then go into an instrumental thing.\u2019 He directed us,\u201d Lee recalls. \u201cIt was really good for us to have that outside perspective.\u201d\n \nThe group then retreated to Nashville\u2019s Blackbird Studios to record. \u201cNick got it. He understood what we were going for,\u201d Lee says. \u201cThe thing he was going to amp up was the band side, which was what we wanted to focus on.\u201d\n \n\u201cEvanescence\u201d crackles with an urgency that seeps through each of the 12 tracks. Opening slab, the hard-driving \u201cWhat You Want,\u201d is about Lee\u2019s decision to head back into the fray after the band\u2019s hiatus. \u201cIt\u2019s totally about going back to being in Evanescence,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s motivating myself not to be afraid. I\u2019m writing about the chaos of life and that you can\u2019t control all the crazy things that happen to you.\u201d\n \nThe stunning video for the single, helmed by award-winning director Meiert Avis from an idea conceived by Lee and her younger sister, Carrie, traces the history of the band combined with  gothic imagery of New York. It ends with the group\u2019s members walking into the ocean. \u201cI can\u2019t make a video without some water,\u201d Lee laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s either going to rain on me or I\u2019m getting into the water. Here, it represents us moving on into this unknown thing; going into the future.\u201d\n \nThe wrenching \u201cLost In Paradise\u201d opens with Lee\u2019s haunting solo piano before exploding into a sweeping, string-laden tale of torment. \u201cIt\u2019s the most intimate song on the album,\u201d  Lee says. \u201cThis song came out in a moment where I felt lost, I was at war within myself. It\u2019s raw and open.\u201d\n \n\u201cIt was Nick\u2019s idea for the band to come in where they do,\u201d Lee says. \u201cI love how big and important it\u2019s become for all of us. It started out as this tiny, raw thing and it\u2019s become one of my favorite songs.\u201d \n \nHeavy, chugging guitars propel \u201cThe Other Side,\u201d a story of love that survives whatever tries to destroy it, including death, while the rhythmic, multi-layered \u201cMy Heart Is Broken\u201d takes the listener on a journey of escape. \u201cThat was inspired by victims of sex trafficking,\u201d Lee reveals. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to find your way out.\u201d\n \nThe album closes with a last-minute addition:  the dreamy, atmospheric \u201cSwimming Home,\u201d a tune that exposes a side of Evanescence that fans have never seen. \u201cThat song is the biggest departure,\u201d Lee says. \u201cIt came from a phase when I was making music that was ethereal and programming driven. Thematically, \u201cSwimming\u201d addresses \u201ccrossing over into the next life. It\u2019s the bittersweet acceptance.\u201d\n \nThe break between \u201cThe Open Door\u201d and \u201cEvanescence\u201d provided the band with much-deserved rest, but also some clarity as to how important what they had created meant to them.\n \n\u201cI do have a new perspective and a big part of that for me was being able to step away and knowing for certain that I\u2019m here making this record because I love what I do,\u201d Lee says.\n \nLee spent her time away from the band with her new husband and learning how to lead a \u201cnormal\u201d adult life in her adopted hometown of New York City.  \u201cEvanescence is my life\u2019s work. I\u2019ve been working on it since I was a young teenager,\u201d Lee says. \u201cBy the time we finishing touring \u2018The Open Door,\u2019 I just wanted to nest a little bit... and build a life that didn\u2019t revolve around my being in Evanescence.\u201d\n \nBut then the muse came calling and Lee and her bandmates felt an urgent need to express what was building inside of them. \u201cThe reason our music is epic and dramatic is because the biggest emotions that I ever feel, the music is the only way to get them out of my heart,\u201d Lee says. \u201cWords alone aren\u2019t enough. It heals my heart to make music.\u201d\n \nNow, Evanescence\u2019s thoughts have turned to returning to the road.  \u201cThis record is so geared for live shows,\u201d Lee says. \u201cWe were thinking about playing live the whole time we were writing it.\u201d\n \nMaking the return all the sweeter are the fans. \u201cI can\u2019t describe how great it feels to have their support. I love so much meeting them before and after the show. If feels like they\u2019re growing with us,\u201d says Lee.\n \nThough already superstars, Lee and her bandmates have the enthusiasm of newcomers as they look to a future that is brimming with possibility through  \u201cEvanescence.\u201d\n \n\u201cThis moment right now between us and the fans, it feels like a celebration, a homecoming, a family reunion,\u201d Lee says. \u201cWe\u2019re so happy to be back.\u201d ","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"New York, NY","genre":"Rock","hometown":"New York, NY","is_published":true,"record_label":"Wind-up Records","talking_about_count":67012,"username":"Evanescence","website":"http:\/\/www.evanescence.com http:\/\/twitter.com\/Evanescence http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/evanescencevideo","were_here_count":0,"id":"7091561785","name":"Evanescence","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Evanescence","likes":22248849,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151368112246786","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/601769_10151368112246786_1168591352_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Our debut album \"When It Was Now,\" is now available on iTunes- http:\/\/smarturl.it\/atlas","band_members":"Keith - Guitar & Vox\nMichael - Drums","bio":"The members of Adelaide, Australia\u2019s Atlas Genius do things a little differently\u2026.They set about building a studio where they could write and record music for their newly formed band three years before they even played their first live show as Atlas Genius. \u201cWe really got down and dirty with dry walling and literally laying the floorboards, and at the same time we were taking a couple of days a week to focus on writing songs,\u201d recalls Keith Jeffery, Atlas Genius\u2019s vocalist\/guitarist. \"We had a lot of song ideas and it was important to us to have our own studio where we could experiment and hone in on our sound,\" adds brother and drummer, Michael Jeffery. Their dream studio, which took two years to build, was designed and outfitted by the brothers with the help of their father (who comes from a music and engineering background). Once the studio was complete, the first song that Atlas Genius finished was a song called \u201cTrojans,\u201d which they wrote, recorded and produced in collaboration with their friend, keyboardist Darren Sell. After many weeks tweaking the song, Michael insisted that the song was ready to be heard outside of the studio walls.  Within an hour, \u201cTrojans\u201d was on the Triple J Unearthed Website, SoundCloud, and for sale via TuneCore on iTunes, Amazon and Spotify worldwide. \n\n\u201cWe had begun to think that music was a pipedream and we had all gone back to university to pursue more realistic careers,\u201d says Keith. \u201cWe\u2019d had such a long slog of playing late nights and working all day, and it felt like we didn\u2019t really have anything to show for it.\u201d But then, in the midst of cramming for their Fall 2011 semester final exams, Neon Gold discovered \u201cTrojans\u201d on the Triple J Unearthed Website and wrote a post praising \u201cTrojans\u201d as a song sure to \u201cinvade your head, all dressed up in a clever disguise of earnest vocals riding a hooky riff.\u201d Checking the band\u2019s email account for the first time in over a month, the band found that dozens of record labels, publishers, lawyers, booking agents and management companies from all over the world had contacted them. \n\n\u201cWe were trying to focus on school, but it was just impossible,\u201d recalls Keith. \u201cSo we said, \u2018There\u2019s something going on here. Let\u2019s get back to the music.\u2019\u201d The band added manager, Jonny Kaps from +1, to their extended family to navigate all of the interest as the band focused on writing and recording more songs.  \n\nQuickly named an iTunes Single of the Week in Australia and New Zealand, \u201cTrojans\u201d reached #4 on Hype Machine by the end of May. In August, SiriusXM Satellite Radio\u2019s Alt-Nation discovered the song on a blog and decided to give it some spins. There was an immediate reaction from listeners, and in September, \u201cTrojans\u201d was placed into heavy rotation, where it maintained a top-five position on the listener-generated Alt-18 countdown and peaked at number one for 4 consecutive weeks in January 2012. \u201cTrojans\u201d began selling over a thousand tracks per week on U.S. iTunes and soon climbed to 45,000 sales - all with zero promotional efforts from the still-unsigned Atlas Genius.\n\n\u201cKnowing we had this audience that was waiting on new songs, we had a much greater sense of purpose than we had before,\u201d says Keith. \u201cIt was really exciting to know that there were people who wanted to hear more of our music.\u201d Although labels were clamoring for the band to come to the U.S. and play a series of showcase gigs, Atlas Genius turned down those offers in favor of staying in Adelaide to keep writing and recording new songs. In February 2012, after months of communicating with numerous labels via Skype, the band chose to travel to the US in order to make their label decision. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019d never been to America before,\u201d says Keith. \u201cWe flew in at night and saw this sea of lights, and it really became apparent to us how massive the U.S. is. It was pretty intimidating - like \u2018How do we fit into all this?\u2019\u201d In April 2012, the band returned to the states having made their decision to sign with Warner Bros. Records. \u201cWe felt a connection with them,\u201d notes Keith. \u201cEveryone there feels very creative and dedicated to the music.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s first release from their new label home, the EP Through The Glass (produced, engineered and mixed by the band), came out in June of 2012. With Through The Glass completed, Atlas Genius then holed up in its studio and worked on writing and recording its first full-length album, while at the same time rehearsing for their first ever tour. The tour started in August 2012 which led to three more tours back to back in the US.  Thus, their full-length debut was finished up between tour dates and got completed just before Christmas 2012. When It Was Now was released in the U.S. on February 19th, 2013, with its international release following soon after.   \n\nThe debut captures Atlas Genius\u2019s singular combination of sophisticated musicality and warm, wistful spirit. Infused with a classic sensibility, each of the songs would fit seamlessly if somehow slipped into a long-treasured mixtape. On the shimmering \u201cSymptoms,\u201d for instance, taut keyboard riffs mesh with urgent acoustic strumming before the band bursts into a gently frenetic, guitar-drenched chorus. Meanwhile, \u201cBack Seat\u201d blends its pulsing bass throb with a sweetly infectious beat and tender vocals that alternately soar and sigh. And on \u201cTrojans,\u201d Atlas Genius begins with a restrained guitar melody and vocal (\u201cTake it off, take it in\/Take off all the thoughts of what we\u2019ve been\u201d) before giving way to the handclap-accented, harmony-soaked refrain and lush yet kinetic bridge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still surreal,\u201d says Keith of all that\u2019s happened over the past 18 months. \u201cI think when we were very young, we had hopes that something like this might happen one day,\u201d he continues. (Thanks largely to encouragement from their Beatles fanatic parents, who encouraged the brothers to begin playing music by age 14.) \u201cBut then you grow up a bit and it seems less and less likely. So when we put \u2018Trojans\u2019 out, we figured it would be a success if maybe a hundred people heard it. We don\u2019t want to force our music onto anyone. Our goal is to write songs that we love and we hope they connect with other people too.\u201d","booking_agent":"(UK\/Europe): Ross Morrison Ross\u0040primarytalent.com (Australia\/Asia): Brett Murrihy Brett\u0040artistvoice.com.au    (USA): Heather Kolker hkolker\u0040paradigmagency.com and Marty Diamond mdiamond\u0040paradigmagency.com ","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Australia","general_manager":"Jonny Kaps: jonnykaps\u0040plusonemusic.net","genre":"Indie, Alternative","hometown":"Australia","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Bobbie Gale: bobbie\u0040bbgunpr.com","record_label":"Warner Bros.

{"about":"Korn will release 'The Paradigm Shift' in stores and via digital retailers on October 8 on Prospect Park.","band_members":"Jonathan Davis - Vocals\nJames Shaffer - Guitar\nBrian Welch - Guitar\nReginald Arvizu - Bass\nRay Luzier - Drums ","bio":"The members of Korn built an immortal bond back in 1993 the first time that Jonathan Davis, James \"Munky\" Shaffer, Reginald \"Fieldy\" Arvizu, and Brian \"Head\" Welch decided to make music as a unit. They shed blood, sweat, and tears in the studio and on stage, fashioning an undeniable, unsettling, and unique sound that would permanently alter the course of rock music. After six seminal releases, two Grammy Award wins, countless sold out shows, and eventually selling 35 million albums worldwide, Head left the group in 2004 to face down the demons of addiction on his own. Korn soldiered on, permanently adding drummer Ray Luzier to the fold in 2007and releasing four more epic full-length releases, most recently 2011's groundbreaking dubstep-metal hybrid The Path of Totality. In 2012, a triumphant and tear-filled reunion happened on stage as the group headlined the Carolina Rebellion festival with Head reprising his legendary part on \"Blind.\" The initial bond came back into focus, but it was time to change the game again. It was time for their eleventh studio album The Paradigm Shift. Recorded with producer Don Gilmore [Linkin Park], it melds the group's ever-present spirit of innovation with their signature metallic catharsis, paving the way for the future yet again.","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"Bakersfield, CA","is_published":true,"record_label":"Roadrunner Records","talking_about_count":80271,"username":"korn","website":"http:\/\/www.korn.com http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/korn http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/korn http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/korn http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/kornchannel","were_here_count":0,"id":"21230560760","name":"Korn","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/korn","likes":12085984,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151956242185761","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/994358_10151956242185761_84440863_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

MADE OF LIONS.  LOUD AS FUCK\n\nOur motto inscribed on the back of a hoodie for the fall tour. The phrase gives an idea of where 3eb is at in advance of the fall dates and recording their new album.\n\nBORN IN SHADOW.  Even though this is a happy period in the bands life-bigger than ever crowds, band gelling and excited to play, new album on the way-- 3EB and particularly 3EB lyrics have always embraced the shadow, the part we're not suppose to talk about, the ones your afraid for even thinking, that is where Stephan's lyrics are going to take you.  And you can see that friendship with shadow being celebrated on this tour in more daring explorations of songs.  The band has been jamming in advance of recording their new album, so this tour will see a band at its most confident in it's efforts to discover new ways every night to surprise and transcend.\n\nMADE OF LIONS is a phrase Stephan uses to describe the way Brad plays drums, but also speaks to the vigor and intensity 3EB puts into live performance.  3EB over the last few years has developed a proud story of a band that clearly feels alive in live performance.   The intensity of 3EB's fans attests to the energy this group creates.\n\nLOUD AS FUCK. They really are.  No backing tracks.  No pitch correct.  No sequencers.  No landing gear.  3EB's intention is to live or die in each moment they play.  To make it up as they go.  \"We are imperfect\", Stephan says.  \"I like the moment, scary as it may be, where it could all fall apart or it could all be glorious and you won't know 'till you huck it over the edge, but you weren't thinking about it, because you already did.  That's what live performance is to me.\"\n\nSo that's what 3EB is about, but what we've learned is that 3EB is about more than a band.  One of the theories for 3EB's upward trajectory these last few years, is fans love to find themselves and each other at these shows.   Stephan always invites everyone to greet each other, and that sense of togetherness as from the line in the song Deep Inside of You, \"I'd walk with my people if I could find them,\u201d creates a spirit that equals the bands every night.  \"I am energized by the exchange with the audience and every night reminds me of how we are all in this together.\"\n\nThird Eye Blind shows are about taking a moment to sing loud and remember you're alive.

They won Metal Hammer\u2019s 2006 \u201cGolden God Award\u201d for Best British Band, and the 2006 Kerrang! Award for \u201cBest UK Single\u201d for their track \u201cTears Don\u2019t Fall.\u201d  Here in America, Revolver magazine heralded the band \u201cBritish Import of the Year,\u201d and THE POISON generated the hit singles \u201cTears Don\u2019t Fall\u201d and \u201cAll These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me),\u201d with the video for \u201cAll These Things I Hate\u201d going to the #1 spot on MTV2.  The band has toured North America three times, and in early 2007, they sold out their first headline trek.\n\nOn January 29, 2008, Bullet For My Valentine is set to return with SCREAM AIM FIRE (20-20\/Jive\/SonyBMG), the band\u2019s highly anticipated sophomore release.  The 11-track assault was produced by Colin Richardson (Machine Head, Funeral For A Friend) and recorded at Sonic Ranch just outside of El Paso, TX in early 2007, and is, according to front man Matthew \u201cMatt\u201d Tuck, \u201creally melodic heavy metal\u2026catchy, hooky choruses and full-on vocals with the music being very in-your-face and heavy\u2026it\u2019s a lot more up-tempo than The Poison, a lot more aggressive.\u201d  \n\nSCREAM AIM FIRE, featuring the distinctive and powerful six-string dexterity of Michael \u201cPadge\u201d Padget, the unwavering instrumental groove of bassist Jason \u201cJay\u201d James and the relentless thundering rhythms of Michael \u201cMoose\u201d Thomas, the musical backbone of Bullet is an intimidating force.  With a lifetime of classic metal inspiration behind him, vocalist\/guitarist Tuck is a formidable and powerful voice for the ever energetic, young metal generation.\n\n\u201cWe have stepped it up a gear,\u201d says the front-man. \u201cThis album is chock full of classic Bullet ingredients. Metal riffs, pounding rhythms, shredding solos and great melodies. We took everything that we learnt from \u2018The Poison,\u2019 and took up tenfold. Better, fresher, harder, sadder and more real.\u201d\n\nOpening with the aural assault of the title track and first single -\u201cScream Aim Fire\u201d \u2013 to the hard-hitting riff slammer of \u201cWaking The Demon,\u201d and the arena-ballad epic \u201cHearts Burst Into Fire,\u201d this album will definitely catapult Bullet into a world-wide spotlight. \n\n\u201c(The track) \u2018Scream Aim Fire\u2019 set the benchmark for the rest of the album,\u201d says Tuck. \u201cIt was the moment we realized the direction of where we wanted the record to go. Lyrically, it\u2019s not a saying that anyone can relate anything else to. It\u2019s ours and the meaning is ours alone. Kill or be killed \u2013 that\u2019s what this game is like. You\u2019re either on top of the game, or you are out, and we are very much still in. Our quality of song writing, our structures, our timing \u2013 the songs are intense and accessible, whilst still keeping our metal roots.\u201d\n\nTuck believes that the band\u2019s unique accessibility lies in the fact that fans \u2013 regardless of age, gender or nationality \u2013 can relate to the subjects and issues tackled within their tracks.\n \n\u201cIt\u2019s important to us that fans can make a connection with our songs,\u201d says the front-man. \u201cFor example, \u2018Waking The Demon\u2019 is about being bullied at school \u2013 which is something that me and most of the boys went though. The track is about one day, just turning round, and deciding to not take it anymore. I\u2019d hope that our fans can relate to that.\u201d\n\nAnd despite the fact that these four musicians are now considered prominent players in the UK\/European metal world, as well as serious up-and-comers here in the U.S. \u2013 the lads remain grounded (all still living in their native Welsh homeland) \u2013 and eternally grateful for the position that they now find themselves in.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the fans, we would never even have been able to make this second album,\u201d says Tuck. \u201cWe are so thankful to them, and we will always try to deliver the goods. I know we had to cancel a load of shows last year (Tuck was hospitalized in the winter of 2006 and forced to undergo surgery on his tonsils), but it hurt us so much to do so. We really hated to let anyone down, but it was an unavoidable evil, and now I am confident that this record \u2013 and this band \u2013 are stronger than ever.\u201d\n\nTo support the release of SCREAM AIM FIRE, Bullet for My Valentine will set off on what will be more than two years of solid, worldwide touring, starting in the UK and Europe in January, 2008, and then coming to America beginning in late February. \n\n\u201cWe are still so hungry for this,\u201d states Tuck. \u201cWe are motivated and ambitious. We know where we want to be.  We have played with legends and if we get to that level, it would be amazing. But you know what?  If it ended tomorrow, we would still be happy. We are amazingly proud of what we have achieved and what we have done. We are having the time of our lives. The world is our oyster\u2026\u201d\n\nScream, Aim, Fire \u2013 the bullets are launched. You have been warned!\n\n\u201cBullet For My Valentine seem unstoppable\u2026\u201d  -- NME\n","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Metal","hometown":"Bridgend, Wales","is_published":true,"record_label":"Sony Music","talking_about_count":80705,"username":"BulletForMyValentine","website":"www.bulletformyvalentine.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"24100690504","name":"Bullet for My Valentine","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BulletForMyValentine","likes":8286882,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152012078480505","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1465267_10152012078480505_730593863_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":120}}

{"about":"Musical project led by Anthony Gonzalez, see the page for music videos and upcoming live dates wordlwide. More here: http:\/\/ilovem83.com","band_members":"Anthony Gonzalez","bio":"Plain big is not so hard to pull off. Queen\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d, Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cComfortably Numb\u201d, Harry Nilsson\u2019s \u201cWithout You\u201d, Jimmy Webb\u2019s \u201cMacArthur Park\u201d, Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 \u201cSweet Child o\u2019 Mine\u201d\u2026rock history is landmarked with preposterously massive songs that are often bloated and overwrought, songs that stand as giant signposts to feeling, but communicate little actual emotion. Grand-scale songs may be impressive, but filling tunes of a synapse short-circuiting enormity with real emotional resonance \u2013 making them memorable for reasons other than size \u2013 is much more difficult.\n\nIt\u2019s a talent Anthony Gonzalez has clearly mastered with \u2018Hurry Up, We\u2019re Dreaming\u2019, a double album that brokers a brilliantly effective accord between the ostensibly conflicting demands of \u201980s commercial pop and experimental rock, and packs some truly giant tunes. The Antibes native has been steadily working to perfect the art of the megalithic alt.pop song since founding M83 in 2001. His self-titled debut from that year and sophomore release two years later, \u2018Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts\u2019 established him as a heavy hitter in the post-rock\/bliss pop\/cosmic electronica league, a skilled producer of hazy, lusciously layered, irresistibly narcotized, epic dreamscapes crafted (essentially solo) from treated electronics, plush synths, murmured vocals and fx-heavy guitar. Third album, \u2018Before the Dawn Heals Us\u2019 (2005) upped the cinematic, star-spangled ante but added a dark strangeness, while in 2007 M83 released the entirely ambient \u2018Digital Shades Vol 1\u2019. It was 2008\u2019s \u2018Saturdays = Youth\u2019, a nostalgia-soaked paean to Gonzalez\u2019s teenage years \u2013 and an unashamed celebration of artists such as Kate Bush and Jean-Michel Jarre \u2013 that paved the way for the monumental \u2018Hurry Up, We\u2019re Dreaming\u2019.\n\nCo-produced by bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen (known for his work with Beck, NIN, The Mars Volta, Goldfrapp), it took just 13 months to complete and features guest vocalists Zola Jesus   on \u2018Intro\u201d and Brad Laner (from 90\u2019s band Medicine) on \u201cSplendor\u201d, plus contributions from Gonzalez\u2019s long-term collaborator, his brother Yann. Gonzalez\u2019s decision to record a 22-track double LP was the result of a youth impressed by The Beatles\u2019 white album, \u2018Ummagumma\u2019 by Pink Floyd and Smashing Pumpkins\u2019 \u2018Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\u2019. \u201cArtists that tried to do something as big as a double album were always inspiring to me,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of work, but I always wanted to achieve something like that one day, and I just felt that the time was right for me to make one.\u201d\n \nThe wryly contradictory title is a reference to a loose theme of dreaming and remembering, which Gonzalez found himself doing a lot more of after he moved to LA to live in January 2010. \u201cThe initial three months were very tough,\u201d he reveals. \u201cI was feeling lonely in my apartment, working on the album and I don\u2019t really know why, but I started to have memories from my childhood. It made me nostalgic in a good way, and I started to remember some of my dreams from being a kid \u2013 nothing very precise, but more the feeling. So, I thought that was a good concept for the album. It\u2019s a retrospective of my life, from childhood to being a teenager and then an adult.\u201d These recollections surface most explicitly in \u201cRaconte-Moi Une Histoire\u201d (when he was five, his mother used to buy him a kids\u2019 magazine with the same title, which had a cassette of narrated stories mounted on the cover) and \u201cOK Pal\u201d, which reminds Gonzalez of episodes in his teens, \u201clike when you first meet someone who really understands you.\u201d\n \nThe album title is also a neat summary of the record\u2019s twin tempers \u2013 urgent and introspective \u2013 and of Gonzalez\u2019s dual identity as dancefloor enthusiast and solipsistic muser. So, \u201cMidnight City\u201d is a huge chunk of glittering and euphoric nu-disco that somehow joins that dots between Peter Gabriel and Underworld, and features not only that big no-no of contemporary pop \u2013 a saxophone solo \u2013 but also a fade-out. \u201cReunion\u201d, too, is built on a triumphantly massive scale, its layer-cake vocals suggesting Toto as produced by My Bloody Valentine, while \u201cClaudia Lewis\u201d ramps up M83\u2019s feelings for \u201980s music from affection to passionate love, even sneaking in the slap bass usually verboten by the contemporary pop police.\n \nConversely, \u201cWhere the Boats Go\u201d wraps woozy pop soundscapes around a sombre piano coda, the aptly titled \u201cSplendor\u201d summons a divinely doomed, synth-centric romanticism and the album\u2019s wild card, \u201cSoon, My Friend\u201d, drops all things electronic in favour of acoustic guitar, strings, brass and a choir. \u201cI like the fact that the album is like a rollercoaster,\u201d Gonzalez says. \u201cSometimes it goes fast, and then it will slow down for a while. You can\u2019t stay at the same tempo all the time.\u201d\n \nThis is an album that\u2019s epic not only in terms of scale, but also of structure, with both an intro and an outro, and brief tracks like \u201cTrain to Pluton\u201d and \u201cFountains\u201d functioning as interludes. M83\u2019s music has long been acknowledged as cinematic, not least of all by Gonzalez himself, who\u2019s a huge film fan (Terrence Malick\u2019s \u2018Days of Heaven\u2019, \u2018Nowhere\u2019 by Gregg Araki, Werner Herzog\u2019s \u2018Aguirre, the Wrath of God\u2019 and Todd Haynes\u2019 \u2018Safe\u2019 are some of his favourites). \u201cThe whole album is like a movie, with opening and closing credits,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a journey, you know?\u201d\n \nThis love of cinema even helped Gonzalez ratchet up his vocal power levels for the new record. When writing in the studio, he often plays films in the background with the sound on mute and, while working on \u201cWait\u201d, he watched \u2018Aguirre, the Wrath of God\u2019, \u201cwith Klaus Kinski and all his anger. And so I decided to try something where I was almost screaming, alone in my studio in LA. That inspired me to go forward in my vocals. Morgan [Kibby, vocalist and keyboardist] came into the studio and I played her the vocal as a work in process. She told me I should start singing like that, so it was a kind of discovery. A good one, I hope!\u201d\n \nKings Of Leon, The Killers and Depeche Mode \u2013 all of whom M83 toured with in 2010 \u2013 can also take some credit for Gonzalez\u2019s newly beefy vocals. As he says: \u201cWhen you see all those frontmen onstage who are very confident in front of a large audience, it gives you confidence to try the same thing and that\u2019s what I wanted to do with this album. I said to myself, \u2018Okay, Anthony; you just turned 30. It\u2019s time for you to be less shy in front of a microphone.\u2019 I\u2019ve never sung as loud before as I have on this album.\u201d\n \nThe widescreen, gee-wow monumentality and seductive mirror-ball dazzle of songs like \u201cMidnight City\u201d provided Gonzalez with a songwriting and production challenge \u201cbecause [my] history is very indie, very post- rock and ambient and cinematic. But I\u2019ve also always been fascinated by pop artists, especially during the \u201980s \u2013 Tears For Fears, Prefab Sprout, The Thompson Twins \u2013 all these bands are a huge influence on this album. It\u2019s my first record where the musical spectrum is so wide and that\u2019s very important to me. Most of the time, people only remember my more cinematic and melancholic songs, but I also want them to remember my pop songs.\u201d\n \nOne thing you won\u2019t hear alongside the synths, slap bass, Sindrums and sax solo on \u2018Hurry Up, We\u2019re Dreaming\u2019 is Gonzalez apologizing for romanticizing the \u201980s. He\u2019s hopelessly hooked. \u201cI\u2019m in love with the sound of the \u201980s,\u201d he enthuses. \u201cI always thought the production then was stunning. It\u2019s very clear and very powerful, with not a lot of elements. Commercial music was better in those days. I\u2019m not saying music is bad nowadays \u2013 on the contrary, music is very interesting and a lot of it is very innovative \u2013 but if you listen to the radio now, it sounds like shit. If you were listening to radio in the \u201980s, you were hearing acts like Blondie, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Tears For Fears, Talk Talk\u2026 there were great songs that were also fantastic and meaningful pieces of art.\u201d\n \nFantastic songs that are also meaningful pieces of art \u2013 for M83, that means instruments played live in the studio, not by a computer, apart from the Pro Tools software he uses for actual recording. He may have been smitten by the impossibly lush, futuristic synths of Jean-Michel Jarre\u2019s \u2018Oxygene\u2019 when he saw him on TV as a kid, but replicating those thrillingly futuristic sounds was never Gonzalez\u2019s aim. \u201cThe main idea with this album was to make something in the way that people used to make albums, before computers. Going into a proper studio, taking time to find the right sounds for the guitars\u2026it\u2019s more about crafting.\n \n\u201cMine is the story of any artist,\u2019 reckons Gonzalez. \u201cI have more experience now, I\u2019m more mature and I have more confidence in my music. This is the first time in my career when, if I have an idea in my head, I can create it in music. It\u2019s something I was never able to do before. I\u2019m a big romantic, especially about music,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more beautiful than something well recorded that you can listen to on a good sound system.\u201d Something meaningful \u2013 and massive \u2013he might well add.\n \nAugust 2011\n","booking_agent":"International Booking Agent ex North America: Paul Bolton | North American Agent: Tom Windish:","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Los Angeles, USA","general_manager":"http:\/\/www.d-e-f.com","genre":"Electronic \/ Alternative \/ Pop","hometown":"Antibe","influences":"Brian Eno, John Hugues and landscapes\n\n","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Mute Records (USA), Naive Records (Europe), Wasted Youth (UK)","record_label":"Mute \/ Naive","release_date":"October 2011","talking_about_count":9011,"username":"m83music","website":"http:\/\/www.ilovem83.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"19342919816","name":"M83","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/m83music","likes":1036143,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151979705739817","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1471131_10151979705739817_964717308_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"YOUR BODY IS A WEAPON - Out Now: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/Wombats-YBIAW","artists_we_like":"Dan the Man, SiN, State Kuban, Team Me","band_interests":"Gindis Growels yey","band_members":"Murph, Dan & Tord","bio":"Within the butterfly-breaking cogs of the music industry, big numbers can bring big problems. And The Wombats\u2019 numbers got big, fast. A platinum album with their 2007 debut \u2018Guide To Love, Loss And Desperation\u2019. Over 300,000 combined sales of their indie dancefloor smashes \u2018Kill The Director\u2019, \u2018Let\u2019s Dance To Joy Division\u2019 (winner of the 2008 NME Award for Best Dancefloor Filler), \u2018Backfire At The Disco\u2019 and \u2018Moving To New York\u2019. A two year tour during which Liverpool\u2019s biggest exports in a decade played to well over a million people, culminating in a massive homecoming Liverpool Arena show for 10,000 ecstatic local fans of their dark yet exuberant and infectious alt.pop.\n\n\u201cIt was such a good way to round it off,\u201d says drummer Dan Haggis. \u201cWe had a two day party after that. Obviously you can\u2019t help but go \u2018bloody hell, remember a couple of years ago in Liverpool, we\u2019d be lucky if we sold out the Academy downstairs to 500 people. How did we get to this?\u2019\u201d\n\nBig numbers, big gigs, but for a band with the intense work ethic of The Wombats (lest we forget, in the build-up to their breakthrough hit \u2018Kill The Director\u2019 in 2007 they played 50 tiny pub and club shows around the UK in almost as many days) they took their toll. Having continued their breakneck schedule for eighteen months solid, they came off a mammoth US tour in 2008 \u201cpretty broken\u2026 physically and mentally.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did a couple of months too long,\u201d says Dan. \u201cI had problems with my arms so every night going up onstage hurt, so it wasn\u2019t really that enjoyable. I had a gig where I didn\u2019t want anyone to look at me. I sat on the drums at Glasgow and you start feeling guilty because you think you should be having the best night of your life but I didn\u2019t know why I was there.\u201d\n\nOver the summer of 2008, between festival dates, two more singles were recorded \u2013 the stop-gap classic \u2018My Circuitboard City\u2019 and their sardonic (anti-)Christmas song \u2018Is This Christmas?\u2019 before singer Matthew \u2018Murph\u2019 Murphy sat down to begin writing new material for album two. But in his new home in London, Murph found the loneliness, dislocation and routine of being off the road and writing in a big city difficult to cope with. He\u2019d simply become too accustomed to the adulation of the stage.\n\n\u201cMy downfall was I got used to it,\u201d he admits, \u201cand then when it all stopped it was a bit of a reality bite-back and I had to level myself out. It was my general unhappiness of not being on the road and being in a new city.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery night for a couple of years to have always been on your way somewhere,\u201d adds Dan, \u201calways about to do a gig or an interview or whatever, always people interested in talking to you about music. Then suddenly stopping and not doing gigs and not having the adrenalin rush every night, it\u2019s like hitting a brick wall.\u201d\n\nThe few gigs that the band did play occasionally ended in near-death experiences. On his way home from a show in Skegness, Murph almost flipped his car on an icy motorway but emerged miraculously unscathed (the incident inspired a new song called \u2018Motorphobia\u2019). And during a trip to Dubai to play Liverpool Sound City, Dan had his own four-wheeled run-in with the reaper.\n\n\u201cIt was fun but me and my girlfriend almost had a pretty serious accident,\u201d he says. \u201cWe went dune buggy racing with no insurance, no anything. They just went \u2018have you done this before?\u2019 and we went \u2018no, not really\u2019 and they went \u2018great! Put this on!\u2019. We stuck this helmet on and went off over these dunes having a great time and ended up going too fast over one of them and basically coming off and crashing quite badly.\u201d\n\nWith so much alienation and vehicular trauma around, it\u2019s perhaps no wonder the first batch of songs Murph wrote in London in February 2009 were delivered to the record label and met with some concern. Lyrically they were the bleakest tracks Murph had ever written (he doesn\u2019t expand on their subject matter) and musically they were heavier than heaven and louder than war.\n\n\u201cThe initial thought was to do things relatively far away from what you\u2019d be known for or what your comfort zone is,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is maybe a good thing, but the first batch of songs that the label heard, they were like \u2018who the hell is this?\u2019\u201d\n\nBassist Tord \u00d8verland-Knudsen chips in. \u201cThey were much grungier. More like the 90s grungy thing, for those first four songs. We needed to get the energy back, make heavier music.\u201d\n\nOr, more accurately, Murph needed to get his Merseyside Mojo back. \u201cI went back to my mum and dad\u2019s house to recapture whatever former glory was once there. It was kind of miserable being locked away in a room for eight hours every day with just a little lampshade and piano. You kind of go round the bend, there was no reality to draw from. So I had to go up to Liverpool and get back to getting slaughtered and doing recreational things in order to find anything to draw on.\u201d\n\nBack in Liverpool, The Wombats Mk 2 instantly clicked. They plumped for a synthier sound, Murph\u2019s keyboard often replacing the lead guitar, and the tunes poured forth in ever more innovative and colourful guises. Tracks such as \u2018Perfect Disease\u2019 took on the sonorous disco moods of Depeche Mode and Echo & The Bunnymen, lashed to The Killers\u2019 arena pop sensibilities. One of the album\u2019s \u201ccurveballs\u201d \u2018Jump Into The Fog\u2019 came out sounding like nothing more than The Horrors covering Queen. Often only their intense catchiness marked these songs out as traditionally \u2018Wombats\u2019 at all: no matter where the sonics strayed, the tunes were always glint-in-the-sunlight perfect - better even than the dancefloor killers of their first chart onslaught.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was rebelling against what we were as a band,\u201d Murph explains. \u201cSomehow we\u2019ve come back round and amalgamated bits of that into the newer stuff and it\u2019ll hopefully make it better. There are elements that are so different from what people will think. There\u2019s songs that are akin to the first album but it feels like we\u2019ve escalated. I\u2019m 100 per cent certain that some of the songs on this album are the best we\u2019ve ever put out.\u201d\n\nFirst single \u2018Tokyo (Vampires And Wolves)\u2019 certainly fits that category \u2013 an instant radio hit that\u2019s so insanely catchy it\u2019s impossible not to spin again the second it\u2019s finished. An ode to the Neon City? \u201cIt\u2019s just a bit angsty,\u201d says Murph. \u201cThe new album hasn\u2019t got anything to do with touring, it just represents escapism and wanting to run away.\u201d\n\nThis new batch of songs finds Murph\u2019s lyrics developing a depth and personal confessional slant that\u2019s rare in modern song-writing: take the blunt and startling theme of \u2018Anti-D\u2019 for starters, in which Murph likens himself to an anti-depressant. But fans of his more story-based writing will find much to enjoy in the synth-rock, disco-destroying brilliance of \u2018Techno Fan\u2019 \u2013 the tune where \u2018Mr Brightside\u2019 chats up La Roux in a drug-swamped Hoxton dive bar. Key line: \u201cI\u2019m in debt to you\/But don\u2019t feed me plant food\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s more of a story,\u201d Murph says. \u201cI went to a minimal techno rave in Shoreditch with my girlfriend. It was dirty, I didn\u2019t stay there for long. I\u2019ve never seen a longer queue for the toilets in my life. People had their hands up going \u2018I actually need a wee\u2019 and everyone in the queue would go \u2018go on then\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe album has been recorded through 2010 over three sessions with separate producers, all in L.A. \u2013 first U2 and R.E.M. producer Jacknife Lee brought his precise technological nous to \u2018Anti-D\u2019, then Eric Valentine helped them put together \u2018Tokyo (Vampires And Wolves)\u2019 and \u2018Techno Fan\u2019. Muse knob-twiddler Rich Costey joined forces with additional creative input from TV On The Radio\u2019s Dave Sitek and John Hill (Santogold, M.I.A., Devo) to complete a record that will shock, impress and spin opinion on this most uncompromising of 21st Century pop bands. The resulting album, subsequently titled \u2018The Wombats proudly present\u2026 This Modern Glitch\u2019, even finds rooms for a guest appearance courtesy of Jane\u2019s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro on \u2018Girls & Fast Cars\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou take the electro and you take the grunge and you put it together with what we used to do on the first album,\u201d says Tord, \u201cthen that\u2019s what the album\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nDan nods, a sparkle in his eye. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a whirlwind adventure.\u201d\n\nHaving entered the charts at #3, the album has provided three of the band\u2019s biggest airplay hits to date with its first singles \u2018Tokyo (Vampires & Wolves)\u2019, \u2018Jump Into The Fog\u2019 and \u2018Anti-D\u2019 as The Wombats subsequently become one of the stand-out names on this summer\u2019s festival circuit with headline sets at Lovebox and Wakestock as well as other major events including Glastonbury, V, Radio 1\u2019s Big Weekend and Rockness. Always a resolutely popular live band, both of their recent UK tours were entirely sold-out and included major London dates at the Brixton O2 Academy and the HMV Hammersmith Apollo. Having recently released the single \u20181996\u2019, The Wombats culminated a triumphant year with three special homecoming shows at Liverpool\u2019s O2 Academy with further major shows already confirmed for 2012.","booking_agent":"Matt Bates: matt\u0040primary.uk.com","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Simon Bobbett: simon\u0040sb-management.com","hometown":"Liverpool","influences":"The Smashing Pumpkins","is_published":true,"record_label":"14th Floor Records \/ Warners","talking_about_count":1477,"username":"thewombatsuk","website":"http:\/\/www.thewombats.co.uk\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"33036879568","name":"The Wombats","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thewombatsuk","likes":535032,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152293729719569","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1374157_10152293729719569_2030303800_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

On their new album, American Tragedy, Hollywood Undead dissect those very same dreams with a volatile and vibrant hip hop swagger, a magnificent metallic crunch, and a danceable industrial soul. At the heart of the band's second release for A&M\/Octone, these six musicians\u2014Johnny 3 Tears, J-Dog, Charlie Scene, Da Kurlzz, Funny Man, and Danny\u2014rhyme and rock from sharply hilarious jabs about vacuous clubs to unbridled, poignant musings on losing faith and struggling with addiction. Due out April 5, 2011, American Tragedy peeks at the death of the American dream from the rooftop of the hottest party in the world. This second offering from Hollywood Undead is a sanctuary for the disillusioned masses that made the band a Gold-selling sensation. It's a middle finger to the safe, burdensome \"norm.\" It's the future of heavy pop\u2026\n\nHollywood Undead have been staring at that future from the moment they burst onto the scene with their breakout 2008 debut, Swan Songs. Since its release, Swan Songs has exceeded sales of 800,000 worldwide and is quickly approaching platinum status. The band embarked on a two-year world tour that saw them play countless sold out headline shows as well as prestigious festivals such as the UK's Download Festival. In addition, the album's leadoff single \"Undead\" received prominent placements in the trailer for Paramount's hit film, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra and Madden NFL 2009. In 2009, the band released the Desperate Measures DVD\/CD capturing their magnetic madness on stage. The collection also featured a few unreleased gems and covers. However, everything merely serves as a prelude to American Tragedy. \n\nHollywood Undead began constructing American Tragedy in early 2010. Collaborating with producers Don Gilmore, Griffin Boice, and S*A*M and Sluggo, the band tapped into a myriad of influences and styles, yielding music that's as diverse and dangerous. American Tragedy's first single, \"Hear Me Now,\" is an anthemic catharsis of guitars and synths, colored by these six distinct voices. At the same time, \"Been To Hell\" creeps from an ominous bass line into full-blown aural assault and battery during a distorted refrain. \"I Don't Wanna Die\" is a funeral march for any and all enemies in Hollywood Undead's path. Meanwhile, \"Comin' In Hot\" could set any dance floor off with slickly sharp rhymes and \"Levitate\" floats into mainstream crossover territory on a soaring chorus. \n\nFor Hollywood Undead, American Tragedy was a natural progression from Swan Songs. About the band's sophomore album, J-Dog exclaims, \"Similar to our first record, there's something for everybody. Some of the songs have bigger hooks, while others are a lot heavier. We wanted to expand our creative palette as a band and grow. We wrote the first album years ago. Mentally, we\u2019re not in the same place we were then. We got better at what we do lyrically and musically. We wanted to experiment more and embrace new elements. It's heavier at points because we are a rock band, for the most part.\" \n\nJohnny 3 Tears goes on, \"American Tragedy is what Hollywood Undead is. We can incorporate anything into the landscape of our songs. There are no boundaries. Musically, I like songs that go against the grain. I want to create art that doesn't conform to the status quo. We choose to take everything a step beyond that.\"\n\n\"Hear Me Now\" encapsulates that sentiment. Blending an arena rock stomp with rap attitude, the song's a venomous and vicious strike. All six members hunkered down in the same Hollywood rehearsal room to write \"Hear Me Now\" together, and it brandishes the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of all their personalities. On December 21, the band officially released \"Hear Me Now\" digitally, and within two short days, it hit number 2 on the iTunes rock chart. The song covers the current state of affairs, calling listeners to arms. \n\n\"Obviously, it's a struggling song,\" declares Johnny 3 Tears. \"Everyone is going through a rough time, and the song is very appropriate for this day and age. We aimed to make something that you can sing along to, and the message gets delivered in between.\"\n\nOne song that examines hopelessness is the bludgeoning \"Been to Hell.\" In between a wall of raging rhythms and angry rhymes, the band comments on failed purposes. \"Growing up in Los Angeles, we've seen a lot of people come out here with grandiose ambitions and, 99.9 percent of the time, they don't do shit,\" continues J-Dog. \"They end up partying, getting on drugs, and just going home. You've got to go through those hardships to actualize your dreams. The song's about getting off your ass and working towards a higher goal. I hope it actually inspires someone to follow through with what they say.\"\n\nHollywood Undead continue to work themselves to the bone. Every night on tour, they spill blood for packed venues of diehard fans all over the world, and they'll continue that tradition. There's no doubt that every track on American Tragedy will resonate with those fans too. J-Dog states, \"People are having a hard time right now, and kids go through the same problems everywhere. I feel lucky that they come to our shows, and it\u2019s their release for an hour.\"\nSongs like \"Levitate\" and \"Street Dreams\" show another side of Hollywood Undead. The band's sense of humor remains in tact, but they also brandish a pop prowess that's simply undeniable. About touting so many styles, Johnny 3 Tears exclaims, \"I want fans to feel like they got their money's worth with a full album you can't categorize. This is a step up. We want to be a band that's special to kids. We want to signify what they feel. I'd love for them to have the same feeling I had when I listened to Korn or Nine Inch Nails as a kid.\"\n\nThat revolutionary spirit courses through American Tragedy, and the band place their hearts on the line for their music once again. J-Dog concludes, \u201cAs a band, we collectively put our blood, sweat, and soul into this. We couldn\u2019t have done anything better than we did, and we love it. We are honest, and kids connect with that. They know we\u2019re not bullshitting them. When you\u2019re true to yourself, people connect with you.\" \nThat connection to Hollywood Undead will only grow stronger with American Tragedy.\n\n\u2014 (Rick Florino, January 2011)\n","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Los Angeles, CA","genre":"An explosive cocktail of hip hop, pop, rock and metal","hometown":"No Other Place than LA","is_published":true,"record_label":"A&M\/Octone","release_date":"April 5th","talking_about_count":10969,"username":"hollywoodundeadofficial","website":"http:\/\/www.hollywoodundead.com http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/hollywoodundead http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/hollywoodundead http:\/\/www.ilike.com\/artist\/Hollywood+Undead","were_here_count":0,"id":"19852287980","name":"Hollywood Undead","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hollywoodundeadofficial","likes":3381789,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151624389887981","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1174882_10151624389887981_1314623074_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"\"Seether: 2002-2013\" is now available. iTunes: http:\/\/ow.ly\/oHxZP \/ Amazon: http:\/\/ow.ly\/oHy4t \/ Limited edition: http:\/\/seether.com","band_members":"Shaun Morgan - vocals, guitar\nDale Stewart - bass, vocals\nJohn Humphrey - drums, awesomeness\n","bio":" A little more than a decade ago, a hard rocking trio from South Africa, changed its name from Saron Gas to Seether and disembarked for the United States. It was, according to frontman Shaun Morgan, \"an emotional decision, by no means easy. Taking that big step was terrifying, but I feel that the decision we made, as tough as it was, was ultimately the correct one.\"\n\nTalk about an understatement...\n\nOver the course of five albums, Seether -- Morgan, bassist Dale Stewart and drummer John Humphrey -- has proved itself to be one of the rock world's most consistently diverse, unquenchably ambitious bands. And also one of its most successful; Seether has sold millions of albums worldwide, including four gold albums and the platinum Finding Beauty In Negative Places, and launched 11 #1 singles and 17 Top 5 hits across multiple formats at radio, including enduring favorites such as \"Broken,\" \"Remedy,\" \"Fine Again,\" \"Fake It\", \"Rise Above This\" \"Country Song,\" \"Tonight\" and \"No Resolution.\"\n\nHeck, Seether even cranked Wham!'s \"Careless Whisper\" into a Top 5, platinum hard rock ballad. \n\nSEETHER 2002-2013 certainly backs that up, taking stock of the group's first decade or so of accomplishment. After all, how many bands can really deliver a best-of compilation that spans two discs, with each of the 27 songs -- including rare B-sides, film soundtrack contributions and three eye-opening demos -- as strong as the next, representing a catalog rich in defining, adventurous moments from the first single, \"Fine Again,\" to new offerings \"Safe to Say I've Had Enough,\" \"Weak\" and a high-octane treatment of Veruca Salt's \"Seether,\" which inspired the group's moniker all those years ago. \n\n\"I think our career thus far has far exceeded our expectations in every way,\" Morgan says. \"We've played all around the world and shared stages with bands that we admire and respect. That's far more than we ever thought possible. It's been a constant surprise to have each album be so well received and to see the success of our singles at radio. It's very gratifying and extremely humbling to be able to reach out and touch so many lives. I feel that each new album has led us to challenge ourselves to be creative and write interesting songs that will hopefully stand the test of time, instead of trying to fit into a temporary fad or changing our style to suit a certain radio climate. \n\n\"I feel that when you listen to the songs we were writing in 2000 and listen to the songs we write now, that we have progressed quite a lot and we're creating music that's far more interesting and occasionally more challenging than our early stuff. It's important to evolve and grow so that you stay on top of your game and write a stronger album each go around.\"\n\nThe early Seether \"liked a lot of different kinds of music\" according to Morgan, and the pull of classic rock melodicism and metal and grunge ferocity was certainly heard on 2002's Disclaimer, which started life in South Africa before the band decamped for Los Angeles. The pensive ballad \"Fine Again\" put Seether on the map -- and onto the soundtracks of the video games Madden 2003 and 1080 Avalanche -- but tracks such as the grooving \"Gasoline\" and the explosive ebb-and-flow of \"Driven Under\" established Seether's heavyweight credentials enough to land the band a spot on the 2002 OZZFest tour. \n\n\"Broken\" was the song that broke things wide open, however. A mellow, acoustic closer to Disclaimer, Seether re-recorded it with fuller instrumentation and tighter dynamics as a duet between Morgan and Evanescence's Amy Lee. The new rendition first appeared on the Punisher soundtrack and hit No. 20 on the Billboard 200, and it was voted the Best Song From a Movie Soundtrack in the 2004 Metal Edge Reader's Choice Awards. Its success also led to the release of Disclaimer II, an expanded edition of the debut album. \n\nThe success of \"Broken\" and \"Fine Again\" created an odd dilemma as Seether began working on its second album, 2005's Karma & Effect. \"Ultimately the impression of the band that was created was a fairly false one,\" Morgan notes. \"By that I mean we played shows and people would come up and know the songs on the radio, but when we played a heavy rock song they didn't know what to do with themselves. I think people expected matchbox twenty, and we weren't anything like that.\" Consequently on Karma & Effect, Morgan and company set out \"to write an album that was heavier and darker. We didn't want to have to deal with misconceptions again.\" And if there was indeed a darker and more ominous tone to the album -- which debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 -- nobody who heard the skull-rattling riffs of \"Remedy,\" \"Truth\" and \"The Gift\" was left with any doubt about just what kind of band Seether was. But Seether could be just as impactful when it quieted down, as evidenced by One Cold Night, a live acoustic CD\/DVD set recorded during early 2006 in Philadelphia that included a cover of Pearl Jam's \"Immortality.\" \n\nSeether returned to the studio for 2007's Finding Beauty In Negative Places, another Top 10 entry. Morgan, never one to shy away from personal subject matter, tapped into his forced stint in rehab the previous summer, which he calls \"an interesting experience\" -- and an inspirational one. Morgan came in with more than 50 songs that were written and considered by Seether and producer Howard Benson. \"The songs went through phases,\" Morgan says. \"You could tell -- here's my dark phase, then I got pissed off and started writing super metal riffs, as heavy as I could make it. Then I had my melancholy phase, all acoustic, said stuff. And I ended up coming out at the end and writing stuff that's possibly a little more hopeful. So, yeah, some good came out of it.\" That whole range can be heard in selections such as \"Fake It,\" \"Rise Above This\" and \"Breakdown,\" as well as the aforementioned, and very surprising, \"Careless Whisper.\"\n\n\"The whole idea of the album was to embrace songwriting, just have an album full of songs,\" Morgan explains. \"The bands I like, like Nirvana or Pearl Jam or Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, are all about songs. It's not all one thing. So we tried to give more of a cross-section of the band.\" Finding Beauty In Negative Places became one of Seether's most decorated albums, too, with a platinum certification in the U.S. and winning a South African Music Award for Best Rock: English performance and an MTV Africa Music Award for Best Alternative Act. \n\nIn its wake, Morgan notes, \"we felt like we had to raise the bar every time we write new songs,\" which made for an exacting and occasionally exasperating making of 2011's Holding onto Strings Better Left to Fray with producer Brendan O'Brien at Nashville' historic Blackbird Studios. \"This album took a little time because we wrote more songs and we wrote a little more carefully and certainly took our time with them,\" Morgan says. That time paid off, though, with another diverse collection that gave Seether its highest-ever Billboard 200 peak -- No. 2 -- in addition to topping the Rock Albums, Alternative Albums and Hard Rock Albums charts. Spawning hits such as \"Country Song,\" \"Tonight,\" \"No Resolution\" and \"Here and Now,\" Holding onto Strings Better Left to Fray was an unqualified smash that made Seether Billboard`s No. 1 Active Artist and No. 1 Heritage Artist of 2011, while \"Country Song\" was the year's top Active Rock song in both the U.S. and Canada as well as Mediabase's No. 1 Song of the Year. Seether capped the campaign by giving back, headlining and curating the first Rise Above Fest during September of 2012 in Gilford, N.H., to raise the focus on awareness and prevention of teen suicide in memory of Morgan's brother Eugene Welgemoed, who committed suicide five years prior. After raising more than $20,000 in 2012 -- with help from pals Buckcherry, Puddle of Mudd and Black Stone Cherry as well as others who contributed items for auction -- the Rise Above Fest will return on May 10, 2014 in Bangor, Maine.\n\nWhile SEETHER 2002-2013 finds the group taking a breath to acknowledge its 10th anniversary, the trio is hardly resting on its laurels -- as evidenced by the set's three brand new, O'Brien-produced tracks. Dale Stewart calls the explosive \"Safe to Say I've Had Enough\" \"one of those songs that didn't require that much effort...It was just kind of everything we thought it needed to be. It was kind of heavy but still had that sort of melodic thing about it. It just worked.\" John Humphrey, meanwhile, says that \"Weak,\" \"fell into place for us rather quickly. I think we ran through it a couple of times in rehearsal and captured the song on the second take. I'm very pleased with the final result.\" \n\nThen there's the group's forceful rendition of \"Seether,\" which serves multiple purposes, according to Morgan. \"We thought it would be a good way to pay homage to (Veruca Salt) and the song that inspired our name,\" he explains. \"And we wanted to represent it in our own way. It's not at all meant to be taken seriously. We figured it was a fun way to celebrate this point in our career, and answer once for all how we got our band name.\"\n\nLooking into the future, Seether plans to keep its good name intact and its creative process as passionate and perfectionist as it's been for the past 13 years. Stewart says Seether is plans \"to go full steam on the new album\" for 2014, though Morgan promises the trio's sixth album \"is not going to be something we rush into and put out a crappy thing just because there's a deadline.\" As SEETHER 2002-2013 underscores, quality is and always will be job one for Morgan, Stewart and Humphrey. \n\n\"We hope to be around 20 years from now, still writing music and touring, to become a band that spans decades is the ultimate achievement,\" Morgan says. \"Hopefully we have set up a good enough foundation for that goal to be achieved. We're looking forward to the future and are really excited about the music we're writing right now, and hopefully, we can continue to win fans and broaden our influence.\"\n","category":"Musician\/band","description":"instagram: seetherofficial","genre":"Rock \/ Alternative \/ Metal","is_published":true,"record_label":"Wind-up Records","talking_about_count":36340,"username":"seether","website":"http:\/\/www.seether.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"8054295551","name":"Seether","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/seether","likes":3125831,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151959541140552","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/575716_10151959541140552_307508824_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

After 5 full length albums, 3 EP\u2019s, a live album, mini album, and numerous 7\u201d singles and collections, Silverstein have sold more than 1 million albums worldwide.  The lineup has remained largely the same over their 12 years on the scene and features Shane Told (vocals), Paul Koehler (drums), Josh Bradford (guitar), Billy Hamilton (bass) and Paul-Marc Rousseau (guitar).  \n\nSilverstein has played more than 1500 shows in 34 countries, and have been a staple on many festivals and tours.  They have been a part of Vans Warped Tour, Take Action!, Taste of Chaos, Rock Am Ring (Germany), Soundwave (Australia), Give it a Name (UK), and also co-founded the Scream It Like You Mean It tour in 2010.  \n\nSince 2003, Silverstein has remained consistent releasing full length albums every 2 years.  They burst on the scene with When Broken Is Easily Fixed (2003) which would shape the scene to come with its dynamic approach of mellow clean tones contrasted with screaming and heavily distorted riffs.  In 2005, their sophomore and best selling release Discovering The Waterfront was critically and fan acclaimed with more structure and melody, but still keeping the emotion Silverstein had become known for.\n\nIn 2007, the band worked with legendary producer Mark Trombino and released Arrivals & Departures.  Sticking to a more stripped down rock sound that went against the slick sampled tones of many bands at the time, the album had 2 of their biggest songs, and a video in heavy rotation on MTV.  2009 brought back \u2018Discovering\u2019 producer Cameron Webb and a return to the bands early sound with A Shipwreck In The Sand, a high concept album that also tackled some political topics for the first time.  The album brought a number of guest vocalists including Liam Cormier (Cancer Bats), Lights, and Scott Wade (Comeback Kid).\n\nAfter a departure from Victory Records in 2010, the band came right back in 2011 with their 5th full length Rescue on indie giant Hopeless Records.  With new producer Jordan Valeriote at the helm, the album featured some of the bands best performances and songs ever, with songs like \u201cForget Your Heart\u201d, \u201cBurning Hearts\u201d, \u201cThe Artist\u201d and \u201cSacrifice\u201d all being successful singles.\n\nNever a band to rest for long, Silverstein also released Short Songs in early 2012, a \u201cmini album\u201d featuring 11 original songs and 11 covers all under 90 seconds long.  This release took the band back to their punk rock and hardcore roots and was a huge critical success garnering extremely positive reviews.  \n \nWith a new full length release and lots of touring planned in 2013, SIlverstein shows no signs of slowing down.

Poll KsE fans and ask which album they like best and Alive or Just Breathing is usually right at the top of the list.\n\nCall it coming full circle, returning to their roots or coming home again. Whatever the case and no matter what you choose to label it, Leach's return to the fold is welcomed and anticipated by all involved, from the band members themselves to the fans. Leach is a fitting piece of the KsE puzzle. KsE enjoyed a decade of success with Leach's replacement Howard Jones, who has moved on amicably.\n\n\"This change is very exciting,\" the band said upon announcing Leach's triumphant return. \"We know you're going to love it. This is truly a new era in KsE history  and it is ready to shred your face off. So, please help us in welcoming Jesse back into the KsE family; he is a rare and great talent, a fact that older KsE fans have known for years. Here is to a killer new record and a bright future. The five of us cannot wait to write this record and play shows together and bring that feeling to our fans. It's been far too long.\"\n\nKsE burst onto the scene with the genre-defining Alive or Just Breathing, notching a Grammy nomination in 2005 for the title track from 2004's gold-certified The End of Heartache and following up that landmark album with the Gold-selling As Daylight Dies and an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live along with gracing the covers of countless metal and rock magazines around the world.\n\nThrough the '00s, KsE adopted a versatile, non-stop touring schedule. The band's road history includes two treks on Ozzfest, stints on Warped Tour and Taste of Chaos, as they have that rare ability to straddle the line between the metal and alternative scenes by touring with Slayer and Mastodon as easily as My Chemical Romance and Underoath\n\nThe band's DVD Set This World Ablaze also enjoyed Gold-selling status, proving that KsE have the metallic Midas touch.\n\nHowever, KsE have never coasted on the wave of prior successes, which saw them become one of the premier, most successful bands to emerge from the so-called New Wave of American metal. With Leach back at the vocal helm and behind the mic and a renewed sense of what they want to accomplish, what once was is brand new again and 2012 (and beyond) looks to be another exciting year (and decade) for Killswitch Engage.\n","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"info\u0040stronghq.com","genre":"METAL","hometown":"Boston, MA","is_published":true,"record_label":"Roadrunner Records","talking_about_count":24814,"username":"killswitchengage","website":"www.killswitchengage.com, www.twitter.com\/kseofficial, instagram.com\/killswitchengage ","were_here_count":0,"id":"7318341580","name":"Killswitch Engage","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/killswitchengage","likes":2411520,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151723540061581","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1377417_10151723540061581_1319224525_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"category":"Musician\/band","description":"Rapping refers to \"spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics\". The art form can be broken down into different components, as in the book How to Rap where it is separated into \u201ccontent\u201d, \u201cflow\u201d , and \u201cdelivery\u201d. Rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat.Rapping is often associated with and a primary ingredient of hip hop music and reggae, but the phenomenon predates hip hop culture by centuries. It can also be found in alternative rock such as that of Cake and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Rapping is also used in Kwaito music, a genre that originated in Johannesburg, South Africa and is composed of hip hop elements. Rapping can be delivered over a beat or without accompaniment. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word as used to describe quick speech or repartee predates the musical form. The word had been used in British English since the 16th century, and specifically meaning \"to say\" since the 18th. It was part of the African American dialect of English in the 1960s meaning \"to converse\", and very soon after that in its present usage as a term denoting the musical style. Today, the terms \"rap\" and \"rapping\" are so closely associated with hip hop music that many use the terms interchangeably.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":5083,"were_here_count":0,"id":"115319395149928","name":"Rap","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Rap\/115319395149928","likes":10213622}

The heartwarming clip chronicles the true life adventures of a man who walks around holding a billboard that reads \u201cFree Hugs,\"the police who ban his humanitarian crusade, and the petition that earned him back the right toprovide hugs to citizens in need.The \u201cFree Hugs\u201d video, which accompanied the band\u2019s song \u201cAll The Same,\u201d earned Sick Puppies exposure on Oprah, Jay Leno, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and CNN, and inspired people around the world to begin their own free hugs campaigns. It also propelled \u201cAll the Same\u201d into a toprequested single at commercial radio stations across North America. But while the \u201cFree Hugs\u201d video helped spread the music and message of Sick Puppies, the band is anything but an overnight success.\nYears before YouTube, Sick Puppies were winning prestigious commendations, including \u201cBest\nSong\u201d from Triple J Unearthed, and \u201cBest Live Performance\u201d from the Australian Live Music\nAwards. The Australian edition of Rolling Stone even called Sick Puppies \u201cthe most dynamic new\nband in the country.\u201d \nThe band\u2019s North American debut, Dressed Up As Life, validates the praise with a heartfelt collection of exultant rhythms, propulsive beats and choruses that span miles. It\u2019s the kind of record that captures the beauty, pain and endless possibilities of LIFE.\nThe aching vocals, melancholy acoustics and triumphant guitar swaths of the renowned \u201cAll the Same\u201d transcend even without the video. \u201cMy World\u201d pinpoints the moment where epiphany turns regret into acceptance by juxtaposing layered instrumentation with bare, simple arrangements. \u201cPitiful,\u201d combines start-stop blasts with brooding atmospherics, resulting in a song that\u2019s both\nangry and undeniable. And, \u201cAsshole Father\u201d is even more sweeping and multidimensional, intermingling serene vistas with stabs of animosity.\n\u201cThe record is an honest reflection of what we were feeling and going through when we were\nmaking it,\u201d says singer and guitarist Shimon Moore. \u201cThere were times when we were really\ndepressed and then suddenly we were happy. So these songs capture that whole rollercoaster\nride.\u201d \u201cThe songs are a combination of all of our influences, from Rage Against the Machine to Green\nday, mixed in with our own style,\u201d bassist Emma Anzai adds.\nThe origin of Sick Puppies dates back to 1997, when Moore and Anzai met in their high school\nmusic room. Moore was bashing away on the drums and Anzai walked in looking for someone to\njam with. \u201cShe stared at me and asked if I knew all these songs by different bands, and I was like,\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 and, we just started rocking,\u201d says Moore. \u201cAt the end of the week she said, \u2018You wanna\nstart a band?\u2019 and we\u2019ve been together ever since.\u201d\nMoore stepped out from behind the kit and strapped on a guitar, and the two hired Chris Mileski to play drums. They started playing covers, then wrote their own material and booked local gigs.\nIn 1999, Sick Puppies released their first Australian EP, Dog\u2019s Breakfast, and two years later,\ntheir song \u201cNothing Really Matters\u201d won Triple J\u2019s Unearthed band competition. Their debut\nalbum, Welcome to the Real World came out later that year. After numerous tours across the\ncountry, Sick Puppies went on hiatus for a while so they could achieve their goal to record their\nNorth American debut. Anzai got a job in telemarketing and Moore carried a billboard of a lollipop sign advertising twofor-one shoes at an outdoor shopping mall. It was there that he met Juan Mann, who came to the\nmall every Thursday with his \u201cFree Hugs\u201d sign. \u201cWe started talking and became really good friends,\u201d Moore recalls. \u201cThen I asked if I could film him. But we never ended up doing anything with the footage until we came to Los Angeles.\u201d\nSince Mileski was unable to come with them to the U.S., Sick puppies placed an advertisement on the Internet site Craig\u2019s List, looking for a new drummer. Soon, they hooked up with Mark Goodwin, whose hard-hitting style perfectly complimented the band\u2019s aggressive style. While they worked on the new album, Moore kept in touch with Mann, and during one of their phone calls, he\nlearned that Mann\u2019s grandmother had died unexpectedly. To help cheer him up, Moore pulled his old footage off the shelf and edited together the \u201cFree Hugs\u201d video and sent it to Mann. \u201cIt was meant just as a video get well card, and that\u2019s the only reason it got made,\u201d Moore says.\n\u201cThe band saw it and said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you put it on YouTube.\u2019 I still have no idea how it got as big\nas it did.\u201d Upon arriving in Los Angeles, the band signed a new recording contract with indie label RMR\nMusic Group run by Paul Palmer, co-founder of Trauma Records (Bush, No Doubt). The\ntremendous success of the video piqued the interest of numerous record distributors, including\nVirgin Records, which signed Sick Puppies to a deal in 2006, right as their new album neared\ncompletion. \u201cIt was far more difficult to make than we expected,\u201d Anzai says. \u201cIt was a lot of hard work and it\nbasically took us a year to finish. We spent a lot of time discussing the style of the music and the\narrangements, and we reworked the songs over and over until they felt right. So, it was definitely\ngrueling, but it was character building as well.\u201d\nIn addition to learning to write better rhythms and melodies, Moore flexed his lyrical muscles and\ntapped into a new level of emotional poignancy. He penned songs about his fear of abandonment\n(\u201cMy World\u201d), a desperate effort to save a crumbling relationship (\u201cAll The Same\u201d) and a freaky\nstalker (\u201cDeliverance\u201d). \u201cI think the songwriters who really connect with people are the ones who are willing to release their deepest, darkest secrets,\u201d Moore explains. \u201cSo, I decided to bare my soul regardless of how\nembarrassing or frightening it might be. And I think when you give in to that, it can be very\nliberating.\u201d\nWith infectious tunes, a jaw-dropping stage show and equal doses of hits and hugs, Sick Puppies\nare striking a blow against the horde of faceless modern rock bands that are virtually all the same.\nwww.sickpuppies.net","booking_agent":"Andy Somers & Bruce Solar \u0040 The Agency Group, L.A. +1 310 3852800","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Los Angeles, CA (from Sydney, Australia)","general_manager":"Paul Stepanek Management","hometown":"Sydney, Australia now in Los Angeles, CA","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Kristen Kanopka \u0040 Capitol Music Group","record_label":"RMR\/Capitol","talking_about_count":7053,"username":"sickpuppies","website":"http:\/\/www.sickpuppies.com\/ http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/sickpuppies http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/sickpuppies http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/sickpuppies http:\/\/www.ilike.com\/artist\/Sick+Puppies http:\/\/www.last.fm\/music\/Sick+Puppies http:\/\/www.sickpuppiesmerch.net http:\/\/www.sickpuppiesworldcrew.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"7299612641","name":"Sick Puppies","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sickpuppies","likes":1127357,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152060892342642","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1463095_10152060892342642_1647988359_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Official Nickelback Facebook page. See 'The Hits' Tour live this fall.  Visit http:\/\/www.nickelback.com for dates and more.  Bottoms up!","band_members":"Chad Kroeger - lead vocals\/guitars\nRyan Peake - guitars\/backing vocals\nMike Kroeger - bass\nDaniel Adair - drums","bio":"While 2011 proved one of the most turbulent years in recent history, Nickelback has emerged rock-steady with an album that both shakes rock and roll to its core while offering a true sense of escapism to their millions of fans across the globe. If ever the world needed to feel good again, that time is ... Here and Now.\n\nTraversing the sonic spectrum with a pulsating energy and enthusiasm reflected in the musical diversity, Here and Now is the much-loved Nickelback experience propelled to new levels as the band continues to lure listeners into their trademark party brew of fast-lane indulgences; some tunes tamed by somber reflection while others wickedly embraced with a devilish wink and a smile. With almost 45 million sold worldwide, music fans remain thirsty for the vicarious thrills of Nickelback's newest intoxicating elixir.\n\n\"I think we're very lucky because from the beginning, we never painted ourselves into a corner of saying we're only going to make one kind of music,\" explains Chad Kroeger, during the final days of recording Here and Now at his Mountain View Studios outside Vancouver. \"As a result, we're kind of all over the map with the songs that get accepted by our fans. And that's fantastic, because that means there's always going to be a ton of diversity on all our records.\"\n\nIt's a conviction shared by Ryan Peake, who recounts the band's early days of bucking trends as key to Nickelback's longevity. \"When you fashion yourself after musical fads, you'll find out you're yesterday's news in a couple years. Suddenly, you wake up one day and find out you've completely pigeon-holed yourself. But when you're honest in what you do and concentrate on the songwriting, people will follow you. Fortunately, we have such a well-rounded fan base. And in these days of extreme ups and downs and cyclical musical movements, our fans have always stuck by us.\u201d\n\n\"Because at the end of the day,\" adds Peake, \"people just really like hearing good songs, plain and simple. They like to feel good; whether they're singing along or just listening to it. It's something innate in all of us.\"\n\nSo what better way to uncork  Here and Now than a double-shot of kickoff singles that toasts the band's enduring potency: \"Bottoms Up,\" a blazing paean to unlimited libations crafted with unmistakable Nickelback hooks and epic chorus, fueled even further by Peake's blistering guitar, Daniel Adair's thunderous drumming and Kroeger's gritty and commanding vocals as the song's raucous ringleader. Guaranteed to become a party staple, \"Bottoms Up\" will assuredly earn a place in the pantheon of fist-pumping rock classics.  Serving as an equally vibrant mixer is Nickelback's other lead single \"When We Stand Together,\" a decidedly up-tempo anthem that underscores the social conscience still beating in the hearts of those small-town boys from Hanna, Alberta. The highly melodic, foot-stomping anthem belies the more serious underpinnings of lyrics challenging societal apathy as Kroeger sings: \"One more depending on a prayer \/ And we all look away \/ People pretending everywhere \/ It's just another day \/ There's bullets flying through the air \/ And they still carry on \/ We watch it happen over there \/ And then just turn it off.\"\n\nIt's a recurring theme that surfaces over the many Nickelback albums - from previous hits like \"If Everyone Cared\" to \"If Today Was Your Last Day\" - that Kroeger sees as a way of raising public consciousness, even if in small doses. Not one to commandeer a soapbox, Kroeger is earnest when he explains the genesis of \"When We Stand Together\" that \"we can bring awareness to the fact that we can make the world a better place if we actually just stood together and acted as one world, instead of acting as so many different countries with their own agendas.\"\n\n\"It's just so easy for us to see things unfold on TV and then just change the channel,\" Kroeger continues. \"I wanted to draw attention to a couple things in a general sense that might hopefully resonate. And regardless of how 'pop' sounding it may be, I felt the lyrics of  'When We Stand Together' just carried such weight that I needed to offset it with a lighter musical sound. And I think it turned into this really cool balance.\"\n\nIndeed. Both singles are making a huge impact on the rock and pop charts - further testament to Nickelback's wide appeal in an increasingly fractured music scene. But Nickelback has always defied conventional norms; they've pushed boundaries and marched to the beat of their own drum. Call it wisdom or stubbornness, but the band's tenacity has paid off in droves. Billboard magazine named Nickelback \"Group of the Decade\" and their 2001 breakthrough hit \"How You Remind Me\" as \"Top Rock Song\" of the decade. They've achieved a remarkable five Grammy Award nominations, three American Music Awards, a World Music Award, a People's Choice Award, and 12 Juno Awards. Their 2005 album All The Right Reasons  remained in the Billboard Top 30 for over two years, was certified 8-times platinum in the U.S. and sold a staggering 11 million copies worldwide, spawning five Top 20 singles \"Savin' Me,\u201d \"Rockstar,\" \"Photograph,\u201d  \u201cFall Away\u201d and \u201cIf Everyone Cared.\u201d\n\nNickelback's phenomenal success quickly attracted the attention of veteran producer Mutt Lange, famed hit-maker, who signed on as producer of 2008's Dark Horse. The band's aptly-titled album showcased their unwavering resolve, approaching almost eight million digital single sales of hits like \"Gotta Be Somebody,\" \"Burn It To The Ground,\u201d \"If Today Was Your Last Day,\" and \"This Afternoon\u201d plus more than 61 million video plays over the course of the album's campaign. Dark Horse also fueled a record-breaking two year world tour for Nickelback, who so far have played to well over five million fans across the globe. With 15 radio hits charting at #1 since 2000, Nickelback has earned the unique distinction of being the second best-selling foreign act in America - right beside the Beatles.\n\nNot bad for a group of guys who as teens simply dreamed of one day performing \"to more than just the steering wheel\u201d as Kroeger so famously sang in his nostalgic confessional \"Photograph.\u201d  \"Geez, I remember playing every night in a cover band in these small clubs and maybe making $300 a week and thinking to myself, 'This is so awesome! What am I going to do with all this money?'\" chuckles Kroeger, reflecting on his humble beginnings as a musician. His brother, bassist Mike Kroeger, remembers those early days well. \"We would always think, 'God, wouldn't it be cool to play our songs for someone other than just our roommates or family - somewhere where people actually showed up to watch music?' But believe me, none of us as kids were learning how to play the pentatonic scale going, 'Yup, Wembley Arena here we come!\" says Kroeger with a huge laugh.\n\n\"It really wasn't until we got a record deal and then once Silver Side Up did what it did that all of a sudden we were like, 'Okay, we need to start behaving like a world class act and we've got to put together a show that can really entertain people in an arena,\u2019\" adds Chad Kroeger, who likens himself to the Master of Ceremonies of a wild private party for over 20,000 of his closest friends every night. \"When I'm on stage, I'm definitely in \u00fcber party mode. I mean, we put on this huge rock and roll show entertaining people, but everyone always says it goes beyond that - it's like this enormous celebration where all these Nickelback fans can get together and really let loose.\"\n\nWhich brings us full circle to Here and Now, the band's seventh album and quite possibly their most creatively liberating. \"The dynamic in the studio was much more fun again,\" notes Adair. \"This time I felt like, 'Okay, it's just the four of us again, we're self-produced, lets just do our thing.' And it flowed extremely well.\u201d \n\n\"I mean, we actually had weekends off, which we didn't on the Dark Horse sessions,\" continues Adair. \"When you're working 14 hour days, 64 days straight, it's just not healthy. It's actually counter-productive. Because in the big picture, you can actually get more accomplished in the same amount of time with a more normal schedule.\"\n\nAs the band convened from April through early October, Here and Now's 11 tracks grew organically, according to Peake. \"It wasn't calculated at all,\" he says. \"That's why this album is really across the board - from heavy rock and pop-sounding songs, to lighter, more middle-of-the-road songs. We brought a lot of ideas to the table and sussed them out until we were all happy.\" \n\nThe challenge, admits Mike Kroeger, \"is that the more records we make, the more we feel like we have to dig deeper and do stuff that we haven't done yet, but also expand and go even further on the type of songs our fans love. There's a lot of  'No, that's not good enough' and we\u2019ve gotta tear it all down and start again or completely re-tool.\u201d\n\n\"Because we know very consciously what we've done in the past and where the bar has been set,\" adds Kroeger, \"and you can phone it in - that's very easy to do - but our fans will know that immediately. So every time we go into the studio, it's about making our fans happy and hearing them say that it's not only a record they love, but that it's a Nickelback record that they love amongst all the other Nickelback records. That's what we strive for every single time.\"\n\nNickelback strikes all the right chords as they once again prove their uncanny knack for crafting catchy songs with unforgettable hooks and indelible lyrical wordplay. Whether it's melodic ballads like \"Lullaby,\u201d \"Trying Not To Love You\" and \"Don't Ever Let It End\" (an acoustic gem about lovers caught in the \u201cfriend zone\u201d that Chad Kroeger calls \"very special\"), to the metallic roar of \"This Means War\" and the reckless abandon of grinding rockers like \"Gotta Get Me Some\" and \"Midnight Queen,\u201d the band undeniably has hit a home run with Here and Now.\n\n\"So as long as people want to hear us play, then we'll just keep going,\" Kroeger states. \"And until that day comes, this is the absolute best gig in the world and we'll just keep rolling with the punches.\" \n\nBottoms Up!","booking_agent":"The Agency Group","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Union Entertainment Group, Inc.","genre":"Rock","hometown":"Vancouver, Canada","is_published":true,"press_contact":"publicity\u0040roadrunnerrecords.com","record_label":"Roadrunner Records","talking_about_count":107626,"username":"Nickelback","website":"http:\/\/www.nickelback.com http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/nickelback http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/nickelback ","were_here_count":0,"id":"6248267085","name":"Nickelback","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Nickelback","likes":18117866,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151878525707086","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/562931_10151878525707086_943700013_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Staind Live From Mohegan Sun CD http:\/\/bit.ly\/MiGQ0J, \nDVD & Blu-Ray http:\/\/amzn.to\/MTKefY. \nSelf Titled Album http:\/\/atlr.ec\/qGQ3Gd ","band_members":"Aaron Lewis - Vocals\/Acoustic\nMike Mushok - Guitar\nJohnny April - Bass\nSal Giancarelli - Drums","bio":"Staind dove into bleaker recesses than ever before and surfaced with their heaviest and most hypnotic album to date, STAIND, their self-titled, seventh studio album.\nThe multi-platinum Massachusetts hard rock outfit\u2014Aaron Lewis, Mike Mushok\u2014pushed itself to the very brink. There was struggle and strife, but, as a result, Staind constructed a collection of chaotically melodic songs that hearken back to their 1999 major label debut, Dysfunction, while wielding an instrumental and lyrical prowess that could only be cultivated by 16 years of writing, recording, and touring together. \n\nAlong the way, the band forged a melodic musical maelstrom that served as solace for fans of all ages. They sold 15 million albums worldwide, had eight top ten singles across multiple formats with three songs hitting number one, and wrote the most-played rock song of the past decade, \"It's Been Awhile.\" Three out of six albums\u2014Break the Cycle, 14 Shades of Grey, and Chapter V\u2014debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 and 2008's The Illusion of Progress peaked at #3. On STAIND, they channel the intensity from their early days with tight, taut technicality. Mushok augments an avalanche of baritone guitars with a searing solo on the track \"Eyes Wide Open\" as Lewis schizophrenically screams. Meanwhile, \"The Bottom,\" featured on the Transformers: Dark of the Moon soundtrack, twists and turns through a haze of grinding guitars, bass, and drums. These songs are raw and real. They're heavy and honest. They're pure and powerful. They're everything Staind was always meant to be.\n\nMushok sums up the band's return to form best. \"It's like Dysfunction 2011,\" he smiles. \"The music goes back to where we started, but there's still melody. We were ready to make an album that was heavy from beginning to end. It was time.\"\n\n\"I aimed to create distance between Staind and my solo material,\u201d declared Lewis.  \u201cWe decided to go back to what we were doing initially.\"\n\nThe decision to make a heavier album proved unanimous among the band. Staind regrouped in December 2010 as a spring deadline loomed. In rehearsals, they tensely tore through ideas before arriving at what would become these songs. With Johnny K (Disturbed, Sevendust) returning behind the board, Staind constructed a studio that mirrored the producer's inside of Lewis's Western Massachusetts barn. They recorded drums, bass, and vocals in the barn, while Mushok cut his guitars in the band's Springfield, MA rehearsal spot. \n\nDuring the winter months, Lewis stood mired in an intense balancing act of promoting his solo EP, \u201cTown Line,\u201d and toiling over STAIND.  During this time, Town Line debuted at #1 on the Billboard country charts and #7 on the Billboard 200 and garnered Lewis two CMT award nominations. He'd play acoustic shows on the weekend and then return home to commence tracking during the week.  Still, inspiration didn't truly strike until the last possible moment in April when he wrote and recorded the majority of the album's lyrics in two grueling and nerve-wracking two-day stints. Those eleventh hour sessions were an emotional exorcism.\n\n\"Pressure usually kicks in my creativity, but I've never been quite so stressed out over an album,\" reveals Lewis. \"There were a lot of schedule clashes and differences of opinion, and I was trying to muscle through it all. I was burnt from running ragged, and nothing would come out lyrically for months. We'd talk about ideas, but it didn't happen until the end. Those were real feelings of discontent arising within the whole process. There's nothing like shit coming off real\u2014when it's real. I guess that was my breaking point. It was a big heaving deep breath when it was over.\"\n\nMushok adds, \"This was a hard record to make. We weren't all together in the same place the whole time, and Aaron and I butted heads about the music. In hindsight, it all paid off and we ended up with a better album.\"\n\nEvery moment of the process was captured in a forthcoming documentary piece, which Lewis aptly dubs, \"Some Kind of Monster on steroids. It unveils everything that went into this.\u201d After finishing the album, Staind underwent another significant change. The band amicably parted ways with original drummer Jon Wysocki. \n\"Not Again,\" the lead single, brandishes a vicious vitality, teetering between pummeling guitars and an incisive, infectious hook. \"That was born out of the frustrations of making this record,\" exclaims Lewis. \"It came out of being really fucking pissed off, and you can hear that in my voice.\"\n\nYou can also hear it loud and clear on the gritty and gruff groove of \"Wannabe,\" where the singer spits vitriol at faceless online detractors. Then there's \"Failing,\" which snaps from a haunting harmony into an entrancing refrain. With clean guitar and vocals, \"Something to Remind You\" is sparse and elegantly brutal, while \"Paper Wings\" burns with raw rage.\n\n\"There's a deeper anger to the vocals and music,\" explains April. \"Some of the riffs Mike came up with were challenging and incredibly different. We've grown so much, and at the same time managed to find out way back to our roots.\u201d\n\nSince day one, Staind has found ways to make darkness beautiful, wrapping shards of melody inside a distorted hum. Mushok continues, \"I'm very happy to know we can go back to where we came from and write a record like this. It wasn't an easy process, but it was worth it.\"\n\nUltimately, Staind will continue their legacy. \"As a songwriter, you can only hope someone feels what you're feeling,\" concludes Lewis. \"In terms of what I get off my chest, the subject matter has always been a release for me. I think this record is another perfect example of that.\"\n\nJuly 2011\n","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Alternative\/Rock","hometown":"Springfield, MA","is_published":true,"record_label":"Atlantic\/Flip","talking_about_count":8486,"username":"Staind","website":"http:\/\/www.staind.com\/ http:\/\/twitter.com\/staindmusic","were_here_count":0,"id":"28175172673","name":"Staind","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Staind","likes":2106396,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151216478752674","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/250671_10151216478752674_674516132_n.jpg","offset_y":66,"offset_x":0}}

Ten years and four albums later, they gave fans a new reason to believe. \"Feel Like I Do,\" the lead single from their self-titled fourth studio release [Eleven Seven Music, 2010], became the band's biggest radio hit to date, reaching No. 2 at Active Rock Radio, and remaining in the Top 5 for 12-weeks. With 2009's \"37 Stitches\" off of Full Circle reaching #4 at Active Rock and \"Feel Like I Do,\" the band had 2 consecutive Top 5 Active Rock smashes and cemented their place as one of the top hard rock acts today. The band's sophomore album, Desensitized with second singer Jason Jones spawned a Top 10 hit with \"Step Up.\" Recent successes have paved the way for unique opportunities such as presenting the Lane Evans Mental Health Care Reform to then-senator Barack Obama on Capitol Hill, performing for our troops all over the world and partnering with organizations like The Wounded Warrior Project and the G.I. Film Festival.\n\nIn an exclusive interview in the September 2012 issue of Guitar World magazine, Drowning Pool announced that fellow Texan Jasen Moreno is their new lead singer.

{"about":"Pledge to pre-order our new album\nwww.pledgemusic.com\/flyleaf","band_members":"Kristen May - vocals\nSameer Bhattacharya - guitar\nJared Hartmann - guitar\nPat Seals - bass\nJames Culpepper - drums","bio":"Sometimes, uncertainty functions as the best foundation for creation. In 2012, platinum-selling rock band Flyleaf found itself at a pivotal crossroads for the first time in its career. After over a decade together, the original lineup of Sameer Bhattacharya [guitar], Jared Hartmann [guitar], Pat Seals [bass], and James Culpepper [drums] amicably parted ways with singer Lacey Sturm. However, the guys held steadfast to what Flyleaf had been since its inception\u2014a musical vehicle for hope. \n\nIn Kansas City, another musician faced a similar predicament. Kristen May spent eight years of her life fronting Vedera, and the group disbanded about 3 years after signing a major label deal. While working at a coffee shop and penning solo music, she received a serendipitous phone call. \"The opportunity to audition for Flyleaf came at the perfect time for me,\" she smiles. \"It was both challenging and invigorating. I was stepping into a group of artists who already had this deep bond. It was really like diving into the deep end, and it's what I needed as a musician and a person. It encouraged me to grow, and it proved to be a true blessing. I got to join a new family.\" \n\nAfter a preliminary meeting at a hometown Texas sushi spot and merely one rehearsal, that \"family\" officially welcomed Kristen with open arms. Jared exclaims, \"She fit right in with us. For a while, we didn't know if we'd ever be able to play again. She brought this incredible energy to the table, and it inspired us.\" \n\n\"It's a rejuvenation of Flyleaf,\" agrees Sameer. \"She came in passionately feeling every word. Her delivery was so genuine, and that's what made us all so psyched.\" \n\nDuring their downtime, the members of Flyleaf never stopped creating though. In fact, they each explored other artistic avenues, returning to the fold with a newfound perspective fashioned via personal growth. James continued to build a professional studio in his home. During the process, he developed a knack for fine woodworking. Soon, he became accomplished in the medium, crafting bowls, chairs, tables, and so much more. \u201cI also began cutting custom lumber for other projects. Being able to make something from a tree got my attention,\" he says. \"I was building the studio and reading tool reviews, and I noticed all of these incredible things you can do. You can build something functional or make a piece of art out of a tree. My passion for woodworking keeps growing. It's like music. There's no end to it, and I'm always learning.\" \n\nMeanwhile, Jared founded EachOther, a musical project with his singer-songwriter wife Kat. The duo also opened up a catering company because as he puts it, \"I really love cooking and sharing wonderful food with as many people as possible.\" \n\nPat followed his passion for fine art. He studied diligently and worked towards a bachelor's degree, in between showing at various Texas galleries. \"My sister showed me how to do wood cuts,\" he elaborates. \"That's how I got into it. Then, the band was cool enough to let me do the album artwork for New Horizons.\" \n\nSameer continued to sharpen his musical craft. \"I'm always creating music, whether it's with my guitar or messing around on a keyboard. I continue to gain inspiration through reading books and living life.\" In 2010 Sameer adopted a vegan diet. \"Since then my diet has evolved into a lifestyle and has caused me to be more compassionate.\" Also, Sameer and his wife relocated from Texas to Los Angeles at the end of 2012. \"The weather here is so beautiful. It's been refreshing and inspiring to explore my new hometown.\" \n\nWhen everyone returned to Flyleaf with Kristen behind the microphone, every aspect was renewed. They hit the road for a co-headline tour with Drowning Pool and started writing simultaneously. Entering the studio with longtime producer Howard Benson [My Chemical Romance, Theory of a Deadman, Skillet], they tracked their first single together, \"Something Better\" as part of the 2013 Who We Are EP also featuring four live tracks with Kristen. \n\nMerging delicate rhythmic intricacies, kinetic guitars, and Kristen's moving melodies, it signals a fresh start together. Once the foundation had been built, they also invited close friend, P.O.D. main man Sonny Sandoval, to join them for this uplifting and undeniable clarion call. \n\n\"The song is about finding yourself frustrated within your life or your ability to be useful,\" admits Pat. \"My wife helped me realized that everyone is trying to transform into what they think they should be. The best good in ourselves is that we share this life with others. Finding grace in someone else is real love.\" \n\n\"It was the first time we'd written together,\" recalls the singer. \"I was nervous and excited. We all brought ideas in. I liked the idea behind it. You strive for something better. With this band, we all have an opportunity to be the best we can possibly be.\"\n\nThat's always been the goal though. Flyleaf never stops striving for something better. Their platinum-certified 2005 self-titled debut spawned the singles \"I'm So Sick\", \"Fully Alive\", and the smash \"All Around Me\", which sold over one million digital downloads. The record would go on to stay strong on the Billboard Top 200 for 133 weeks, reaching Top 15 on both the Rock Albums and Alternative Albums charts. They've shared the stage with the likes of Korn and Deftones as well as Stone sour and Evanescence. Conscious of constantly giving back, they played some very special shows for American troops in Afghanistan. Recently the guys along with Kristen also played for troops in Okinawa, Japan. 2009, Memento Mori, featuring \"Again\" and \"Missing\", debuted at #8 on the Billboard Top 200. However, the new chapter looks the brightest. \n\nJames puts it best, \"The message hasn't changed since the beginning of this band. If we can offer a little encouragement and a little inspiration to anybody who listens to us, that's the biggest blessing.\" \n\n\"I still listen to music at all times,\" concludes Kristen. \"I'd love to be able to provide the same feeling of release I get. I hope we can be a comfort and continue to speak to this band's wonderful fans everywhere.\" \n\nIf there's one thing certain, it's that Flyleaf will do just that.","booking_agent":"BAhern_Asst\u0040wmeentertainment.com","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Deborah Klein dklein\u0040primarywavemusic.com","genre":"Rock","is_published":true,"press_contact":"dklein\u0040primarywavemusic.com","record_label":"A&M\/Octone","talking_about_count":11816,"username":"flyleafmusic","website":"http:\/\/www.flyleafmusic.com https:\/\/twitter.com\/flyleafmusic http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/flyleafmusic http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/FlyleafVEVO","were_here_count":0,"id":"82081937593","name":"Flyleaf","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/flyleafmusic","likes":2450766,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151897046737594","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/565049_10151897046737594_349338516_n.jpg","offset_y":100,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"This is the only OFFICIAL Smash Mouth Facebook page!!!","band_members":"Steve Harwell- Lead Singer\nPaul DeLisle- Bass\nSean Hurwitz- Guitar\nMichael Klooster-Keys\nRandy Cooke - Drums\n","bio":"Collectively the band Smash Mouth has sold more than 10 million albums worldwide. Along with their number one hits \u2013 Walkin\u02bc on the Sun and All Star \u2013 they have consistently impacted radio with other recognizable hits like Then the Morning Comes, Can\u02bct Get Enough Of You Baby, and a cover of The Monkees classic I\u02bcm a Believer, which was prominently featured on the Shrek soundtrack (#4, Billboard Adult Top 40).\n\nA quick listen to their music and you realize the multi-platinum Smash Mouth is a 60s influenced garage band with a keen pop sensibility that maintains a timeless quality, a style they have created and that is all their own.\n\nHaving long since established itself as the ultimate true-to-life California party-band the vibe surrounding Smash Mouth is indeed \u2013 at its core \u2013 about having fun.\n\n\u201cWhen we play it\u02bcs a nonstop party,\u201d Harwell says.\n\n\u201cThe band has grown over the years and has reached a level of maturity and clarity,\u201d according to Harwell. \u201cThis is what we do and we\u02bcre going to keep doing it. We can still go out and throw a party every night only now we do it without the hangover the next day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still firmly believe that music can be the way it used to be,\u201d Harwell adds. \u201cLike Van Halen sang (from the Kinks classic hit) \u02bbWhere have all the good times gone?\u02bc It\u02bcs like what happened to that? Well, we\u02bcre bringing that back!\u201d\n\nFans will no doubt have a chance to share \u201cthe good times\u201d with Harwell and the rest of his colorful cast of cronies including bassist Paul Delisle, guitarist Greg Camp, keyboardist Michael Klooster, and drummer Randy Cooke, as Smash\nMouth traipses across the country from coast to coast. And keep your eyes peeled for a new Smash Mouth album due out in early 2011.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the great recordings, you can\u02bct miss the live show,\u201d states DeLisle, who later declares, \u201cThe live show completes the entire package. Recordings are only one part of the whole. This band must be seen to be believed. It\u02bcs a nonstop\nparty that we put on nightly. If we\u02bcre coming to your town it\u02bcs a party you won\u02bct want to miss.

{"about":"Get Don't Panic: It's Longer Now from iTunes: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/dontpaniclonger | A Love Like War music video: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/ALoveLikeWarMV","band_members":"Alex Gaskarth\nJack Barakat\nRian Dawson\nZack Merrick","bio":"All Time Low has emerged as one of the most popular new bands in recent memory, beloved by an increasingly fervent fan following for their fast-paced and fizzy brand of pop-punk.  Now, with the hugely anticipated \u201cNOTHING PERSONAL,\u201d the Maryland-based band has exceeded all expectations with a collection of effervescent new songs, marked by unstoppable hookiness and a newly discovered knack for exploration and invention.  Where other bands might have played it safe by rehashing established hits, All Time Low instead opted to push the envelope by collaborating with a veritable who\u2019s-who of producers, each with their own unique sonic stamp.  Unified by singer\/guitarist Alex Gaskarth\u2019s clever lyricism, songs like \u201cWeightless\u201d and \u201cTherapy\u201d are marked by a range of diverse musical approaches, all the while retaining the patented All Time Low energy and enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cThis record was less about doing what the bands we grew up listening to did,\u201d Gaskarth says.  \u201cIt was more about knowing what we do, developing that sound, but also stemming out, trying new things, and exploring other veins.\u201d\n\nGaskarth, guitarist Jack Barakat, drummer Rian Dawson, and bassist Zack Merrick first got together while attending high school in the suburbs of Maryland.  In 2005, the band released its debut album, \u201cTHE PARTY SCENE,\u201d the success of which led to their signing with Hopeless.  The \u201cPUT UP OR SHUT UP\u201d EP arrived in the summer of 2006, mere weeks after the band members\u2019 high school graduation.  \u201cSO WRONG, IT\u2019S RIGHT\u201d followed in 2007.  Fit to burst with overwhelming singles like \u201cDear Maria, Count Me In\u201d and \u201cPoppin\u2019 Champagne,\u201d the Matt Squire-produced collection scored major MTV rotation, instantly placing ATL at the forefront of modern pop-punk.  The band further sealed its status by touring nearly non-stop, with highlights including multiple Vans Warped Tours, co-headlining the AP Tour 2008, and a series of their own sold-out headline tours, both here and abroad.  In December 2008, All Time Low were named \u201cBand of the Year\u201d by Alternative Press, a remarkable achievement that even now feels like something out of a dream.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still all catching up with us,\u201d Gaskarth says.  \u201cIt was a sort of seamless transition from being nobody to being a band that people wanted to go see.  It happens so quickly that you almost don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s happening, it just becomes a blur.  Then when you get home and suddenly you\u2019re being recognized in the mall, it takes you aback, because it\u2019s just not something you\u2019ve come to expect.\u201d\n","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Towson, Maryland","description":"Don't Panic: It's Longer Now!","genre":"Pop-Punk","hometown":"Towson, Maryland","is_published":true,"record_label":"Hopeless Records","talking_about_count":26114,"username":"alltimelow","website":"http:\/\/www.alltimelow.com http:\/\/twitter.com\/alltimelow http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/alltimelow http:\/\/atlhustlerclub.com\/ http:\/\/www.interscope.com\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"155110212591","name":"All Time Low","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alltimelow","likes":3175085,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151665458162592","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1381749_10151665458162592_1474891359_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Tom Gabel, who was playing in a local grind-core band at the time, started playing under the name as a solo project with no intentions of doing anything beyond making a demo tape, and overcoming stage fright by playing a show by himself. Shortly after these goals were realized, he started collaborating with his friend Kevin Mahon (now of the band forgetters), who accompanied him on a make-shift drum set built out of scavenged (dumpster) pickle buckets and whatever real drum parts they could round up. The two then recorded another 10 song demo tape entitled Vivida Vis on a four track tape recorder in Tom's bedroom at his mother's house. They self-released the album by dubbing copies on boom boxes and stealing photo copies for the covers and lyric booklet. Tom and Kevin moved to Gainesville in 1999 and released their first self-recorded, self-titled 5 song 12\" EP on the Baltimore label Crasshole Records in 2000. This was followed by their first 7\" EP, recorded by Rob Mcgregor at Goldentone studios, entitled Crime As Forgiven By\u2026  and released by Sabot Productions in 2001. Shortly after, they were joined by James Bowman on guitar, followed by Dustin Fridkin on bass. After the last show of their first full fledged tour as a 4-piece band, while driving south on I-75 from Bloomington, IN back to Gainesville, FL their van was struck by a semi truck. They rolled multiple times and landed upside down in a ditch, and while all of their equipment and van were destroyed, everyone walked away from the accident relatively unscathed. It was at this point Kevin Mahon left the band to pursue an interest in train hopping. After briefly considering quitting altogether, Tom and Dustin continued under the name as a 2-piece releasing another 7\" EP on Sabot Productions, fan-titled The Acoustic EP. Unsatisfied with playing music as an acoustic duo, Tom and Dustin began playing music with Warren Oakes on drums and were rejoined by James Bowman on guitar.\n\nIn 2002,  the four-piece released the landmark full length album Reinventing Axl Rose on Gainesville, Florida's No Idea Records, recorded by Rob Mcgregor at Goldentone Studios; an album that has gone on to become No Idea Records\u2019 top selling album. Shortly after the album\u2019s release, Dustin Fridkin left the band to return to college. Faced again with an uncertain future, the band considered breaking up. By chance, Tom received a drunken email from his friend Andrew, who at the time played in the Murfreesboro, TN band Kill Devil Hills. Andrew jokingly said that Against Me! should kick their bass player out and let him join the band. Tom called his bluff and shortly after, Andrew moved to Gainesville, FL. Together, Tom, James, Warren, and Andrew released 3 full length albums, 1 live album, 1 DVD and multiple EPs.  As The Eternal Cowboy, released in 2003 by Fat Wreck Chords, saw Against Me! with Rob Mcgregor as producer but this time making a 100\u0025 analog recording in Memphis, TN at the famous Ardent Studios (The Replacements, R.E.M., Afghan Whigs, Led Zeppelin, Big Star).  Against Me! toured relentlessly in support of the album. In 2005, Against Me! headed to Baltimore, MD to record with producer J. Robbins  (Government Issue, Jawbox, Burning Airlines); the album, Searching For A Former Clarity (Fat Wreck Chords), was met with much mainstream critical praise and landed AM! a record deal with the label Sire Records. The bands major label debut  New Wave, recorded in 2006 and released in 2007, was produced by Butch Vig (Garbage, Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day) and mixed by Rich Costey (Mars Volta, My Chemical Romance, Franz Ferdinand). The album was a media breakthrough and among many other accolades was named Spin Magazine's album of the year. Against Me! hit the road to support New Wave and again, the road ended with a crash. Early in the morning hours, on an icy interstate, while driving overnight from Denver to Salt Lake City, the band's tour bus hit a patch of ice, skidded out of control and landed on its side in a ditch off the interstate. Luckily, everyone walked away unscathed. The moment was a breaking point for the band in many respects as shortly after finishing the remaining few weeks of touring in support of New Wave, Warren Oakes left the band to open a Mexican restaurant in Gainesville, FL. \n\nTheir newest album, 2010's White Crosses, was once again produced by Butch Vig, but this time featured Alan Moulder (Smashing Pumpkins, NIN) doing the mix, and George Rebelo (Hot Water Music) playing drums. They also began touring with pianist Franz Nicolay (The Hold Steady, World\/Inferno Friendship Society). 2011 will see the band continue to tour in support of White Crosses with drummer Jay Weinberg (Madball, The E Street Band), while working on material for their next album. \n\nSince 1997 Against Me! has played over 2,000 shows worldwide, not only having played in every state in the U.S., but traveling world-wide to Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, Ireland, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, Denmark, Hungary, Croatia, Poland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Lithuania.

{"about":"www.sodastereo.com\nTW  \u0040sodastereo","band_members":"Gustavo Cerati, Charly Alberti, Zeta Bosio","bio":"Soda Stereo nace a principios de 1982 con la uni\u00f3n de Gustavo Cerati, Zeta Bosio y Charly Alberti. Luego de un a\u00f1o de conformaci\u00f3n realiza como tr\u00edo su primer show profesional en una discoteca y comienza a recorrer el circuito underground de Buenos Aires haci\u00e9ndose conocer, junto a otros personajes emergentes (Sumo, Los Twist, Melero, etc.) en lugares como Zero, Einstein y Stud Bar.\n\nEl 14 de Diciembre del '84 presenta en el teatro Astros su primer \u00e1lbum, \"Soda Stereo\", producido por Federico Moura, l\u00edder de Virus. En Marzo del '85 la banda participa en el Festival Chateau Rock ante 15 mil personas, siendo la revelaci\u00f3n del mismo. En Octubre interviene en el Festival Rock & Pop, junto a INXS, Nina Hagen y John Mayall. La popularidad del grupo se propaga.\n\nEn Abril del '86, 22 mil espectadores revientan las cuatro funciones que sirven para presentar su segundo disco, \"Nada Personal\" en el estadio de Obras Sanitarias de Buenos Aires. A fines del '86 se concreta la primera gira latinoamericana, que abarca Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile y Venezuela. En Febrero del a\u00f1o siguiente, Soda Stereo participa como invitado estelar del Festival de Vi\u00f1a del Mar -donde se registran 120 casos de histeria colectiva-, y dos meses despu\u00e9s bate r\u00e9cords de publico al debutar en Paraguay.\n\nHacia fines del '87 M\u00e9xico le abre sus puertas: 36 mil personas asisten a los once conciertos que la banda realiza a lo largo y a lo ancho del pa\u00eds.\n\nYa en Junio del '88, Soda graba \"Doble Vida\" en Nueva York con la producci\u00f3n art\u00edstica de Carlos Alomar, guitarrista que trabajo con John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, David Bowie y James Brown, entre otros.\nEl mismo Alomar viaja a Buenos Aires para tocar en la presentaci\u00f3n del disco, plasmada en un memorable concierto al aire libre ante 25 mil espectadores, el 3 de diciembre de ese a\u00f1o. Pocos d\u00edas despu\u00e9s, la banda pone un digno broche al festival \"Tres D\u00edas por la Democracia\", el evento m\u00e1s multitudinario hasta entonces, en toda la historia del espect\u00e1culo en la Argentina, y sacude a las 150 mil personas que desbordan la Avenida 9 de Julio.\n\nEn 1989, Soda supera el primer mill\u00f3n de placas vendidas y encara su quinta gira por el continente americano, periplo que culmina en Diciembre con dos exitosos shows en el m\u00edtico The Palace, de Los Angeles; la puerta a los Estados Unidos queda abierta.\n\nEn Enero del '90 tras un largo a\u00f1o de ausencia de los escenarios argentinos, el grupo comparte con el d\u00fao brit\u00e1nico Tears for Fears un concierto en el estadio Velez Sarsfield. Su performance deslumbra a los 32 mil espectadores, a la cr\u00edtica especializada y a los artistas extranjeros. A mediados del mismo a\u00f1o registran en Miami su sexto \u00e1lbum, \"Canci\u00f3n Animal\", y al poco tiempo se imponen en Puerto Rico. \nEn Octubre, Soda Stereo emprende la gira nacional m\u00e1s espectacular que recuerde la historia del rock en Argentina, llevando durante dos meses a 30 ciudades del interior del pa\u00eds varias toneladas de equipos, dos escenarios m\u00f3viles y una troupe de 70 personas a trav\u00e9s de un recorrido de 14 mil kil\u00f3metros, con una recordada presentaci\u00f3n ante 45.000 personas en el estadio Velez Sarsfield.\n\nEl '91 los encuentra finalizando la \"Gira Animal\" con un hist\u00f3rico concierto en el cotizado balneario uruguayo de Punta del Este. A eso le continu\u00f3 una gira a Venezuela, un desembarco promocional con \"Canci\u00f3n Animal\" en Espa\u00f1a y la preparaci\u00f3n para una serie de conciertos en el teatro Gran Rex de Buenos Aires. Las entradas se agotan r\u00e1pidamente, se agregan fechas y Soda Stereo marca otro hito en el rock latinoamericano logrando con 14 funciones a sala llena , el r\u00e9cord de shows en una sala de teatro. El 9 de Julio del mismo a\u00f1o se registra el concierto que luego formar\u00eda parte de su siguiente producci\u00f3n discogr\u00e1fica, \"Rex Mix\". Contin\u00faan shows en Colombia, la producci\u00f3n de clips, shows en Venezuela y un regreso a Buenos Aires para cerrar el a\u00f1o de manera inolvidable en un escenario al aire libre y de acceso gratuito, ubicado en la intersecci\u00f3n de las dos avenidas mas importantes de la ciudad. Soda Stereo sorprendi\u00f3 y se vi\u00f3 sorprendido por los 250.000 espectadores que se reunieron. La primera mitad de 1992 transcurre con shows en los estadios de las principales ciudades argentinas.\n\nEs en Mayo del '92 que vuelan a Espa\u00f1a donde realizan shows en Barcelona, Valencia, Sevilla y dos conciertos en Madrid. Los ensayos y conciertos realizados en esta gira definieron la direcci\u00f3n sonora que dominar\u00e1 en la siguiente etapa . A su regreso dan comienzo a las sesiones de preparaci\u00f3n del disco \"Dynamo\", que ser\u00eda publicado en Septiembre de ese a\u00f1o y presentado con un ciclo de conciertos en el estadio Obras de Buenos Aires. Varios shows en Paraguay, Chile, Venezuela y una gira de 45 d\u00edas en M\u00e9xico los tienen ocupados hasta Abril de 1993. A partir de entonces los Soda Stereo, despu\u00e9s de mas de 10 a\u00f1os en la ruta deciden tomar distancia.\nCada uno de ellos realiza tareas independientes; Gustavo Cerati graba \"Amor Amarillo\", su primer disco solo; Zeta Bosio se dedica a la producci\u00f3n art\u00edstica de nuevas bandas como \"Aguirre\" y \"Peligrosos Gorriones\"; y Charly Alberti forma, junto a D\u00e9borah de Corral, el grupo \"Plum\" con el que edita un disco.\n\nEs a fines de 1994 que vuelven lentamente a juntarse para comenzar con lo que se convertir\u00eda en \"Sue\u00f1o Stereo\". El primer disco con la compa\u00f1\u00eda BMG, fue lanzado el 29 de Junio de 1995, y a solo 15 d\u00edas de su edici\u00f3n en Latinoam\u00e9rica, se convirti\u00f3 en disco platino; llevando al grupo a una gira por Venezuela, Colombia, Per\u00fa, Chile, Honduras, Panam\u00e1, Costa Rica, M\u00e9xico y U.S.A. hasta Marzo de 1996.\nTras esa gira la banda decide separarse y en 1997 realizan una corta gira de despedida que terminar\u00eda el 20 de Septiembre con su \u00faltimo concierto en el Estadio River Plate de la ciudad de Buenos Aires.","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Buenos Aires","general_manager":"Daniel Kon","genre":"Rock","hometown":"Buenos Aires","is_published":true,"record_label":"Sony Music","talking_about_count":75150,"username":"sodastereo","website":"www.sodastereo.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"571561279551208","name":"Soda Stereo - Oficial","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sodastereo","likes":2687485,"cover":{"cover_id":589407244433278,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/602360_589407244433278_761954693_n.jpg","offset_y":41,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"beck.com","bio":"Beck Hansen was born and raised in Los Angeles.  As a teenager, Beck became immersed in traditional blues and folk.  When he was 18, he moved to New York where he became part of the city's late 80's \"anti-folk\" scene, playing at various small clubs around the East Village and Lower East Side.\n\n\nIn the early 90's, he moved back to Los Angeles, and continued to write and perform music, sometimes alone and sometimes backed by various musician friends from the local music scene.  He made a few home recordings, one of which was the single that initially garnered him attention:  \"Loser\".\n\n\nRecorded in 1991, \"Loser\" was released by Bongload Custom Recordings in 1993.  An infectious slide guitar driven melody, the single's chorus of  \"I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me,\" became unavoidable.  Beck released Mellow God, his Geffen\/DGC Records debut, in early 1994 to critical acclaim.  The album included the aforementioned single as well as the live staple \"Beercan\", and showcased Beck's love of all things musical.  Elements of folk, punk, blues, noise and hip-hop informed the varied sounds on the album.  He also released two independent albums during this period: the melancholy folk-tinged \"One Foot In The Grave\" (K Records) and the experimental \"Stereopathetic Soulmanure\" (Flipside).\n\n\nBeck toured extensively over the next year and a half, most notably appearing on the main stage at the 1995 Lollapalooza tour.  He returned to the studio in January 1995, and emerged in the summer of 1996 with Odelay - a stunning collection of songs that took his earlier experimentation with sounds and song forms to new heights.  Odelay was met with praise from the critical community, earning album of the year kudos from Rolling Stone, Spin, and Village Voice, among many others.  The album also won him two Grammy's that year, for Best Alternative Performance and Best Male Vocal Performance.  Also, at the time of the album's release Beck entered into a grueling tour schedule that kept him on the road with a full band, DJ, and horn section for two years - along the way gaining him a reputation as a formidable live performer.\n\n\nIn early 1998, Beck helped put together an art installation that paired his own work with that of his late grandfather, Fluxus pioneer Al Hansen.  \"Beck and Al Hansen: Playing With Matches\" made its debut at the Santa Monica Museum of Art in August 1998 and has since made its way to various museums and galleries around the world.\n\n\nNovember 1998 saw the release of Mutations, a more stripped down, somber album as compared to Beck's other major label offerings.  The album, produced by Nigel Godrich, featured the Brazilian-flavored \"Tropicalia\" and the sitar drone of \"Nobody's Fault But My Own.\"\n\n\nThe album was recorded in Los Angeles over a two-week period in the spring of 1998, and the sound of the record harkened back to the folk sound of \"One Foot in the Grave\".  Mutations was originally intended for release on Bongload Records, the independent label that released the 12\" of \"Loser\", in the 1993.  But DGC\/Geffen's enthusiasm for the project got them involved, and it was ultimately released by the label.\n\n\nIn summer of 1998, Beck began recording songs for Midnite Vultures at his home.  A year in the making, it is a return to the free form sounds of Odelay.  The album is produced by Beck (except for two songs co-produced with the Bust Brothers) and features musicians from Beck's band (Justin Meldal-Johnsen on bass; Roger Joseph Manning, Jr. on keyboards; Joey Waronker covering drums; additional guitar work from Smokey Hormel; DJ Swamp on the wheels of steel plus \"The Brass Menagerie\": Jon Birdsong, David Ralicke, and David Brown).\n\n\nIt's familiar sounding in that it's uniquely Beck - from the Stax-Volt hornplay of \"Sexx Laws\" to the electric boogie beats of \"Get Real Paid\" to the southern fired futurism of \"Milk & Honey\".  Also included is the falsetto soul workout \"Debra\", a tune originating from the Odelay sessions and a longtime favorite in the live set.\n\n\n\n\n","category":"Musician\/band","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":4886,"username":"Beck","website":"http:\/\/www.beck.com\/\n","were_here_count":0,"id":"14591271531","name":"Beck","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Beck","likes":1518098}

{"about":"Murdered Love Digital Deluxe Edition available now on iTunes: http:\/\/bit.ly\/PODdeluxe","band_members":"Sonny - Vocals\nWuv- Drums\nTraa - Bass\nMarcos - Guitar ","bio":"P.O.D. \u2013 Murdered Love \u2013 Out Now\n(Razor & Tie)\nSonny Sandoval (Vocals)  \t\nMarcos Curiel (Guitar)  \t\t\nTraa Daniels (Bass)\t\nWuv Bernardo (Drums)\n\n \u201cMusic comes down to passion,\u201d says P.O.D. frontman Sonny Sandoval. \u201cThere are not a lot of bands out there today who have that. But I think that feeling is coming back around again.\u201d\nP.O.D. (Payable on Death) certainly has the right to talk about passion in music. Passion has been front and center since the band formed in 1992 in San Diego, CA, and all the way up to the release of their eighth and latest record, Murdered Love. Over the last two decades, the group has sold over 10 million albums (including 2001\u2019s triple platinum record Satellite), garnered four No. 1 music videos, three Grammy nominations and over a dozen rock radio hits, including \u201cSouthtown,\u201d \u201cAlive,\u201d \u201cYouth of the Nation\u201d and \u201cGoodbye For Now.\u201d Music trends have come and gone, but P.O.D.\u2019s fanbase has seemingly only grown stronger.\nStill, after the release of 2008\u2019s When Angels & Serpents Dance, the band took a lengthy hiatus. \u201cYou can blame me,\u201d says Sandoval. \u201cThe record business was changing, and we all wanted to get back to our personal lives and families. When we do P.O.D., we want to enjoy what we\u2019re doing, and not to do it to pay the bills or tour just to tour.\u201d Fortunately, the time off served the band, and Sandoval, well. \u201cYeah, I got in a good place again. P.O.D. means so much to us and our fans \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of love for what we do. I wanted to keep inspiring and encouraging people.\u201d\nThe band initially reconvened with a few jam sessions and the intent to put out a hardcore, Bad Brains-style EP and tour a little bit. But the initial recordings were strong enough to convince the group to tackle a new album. \u201cBy taking a break, we kind of got back on the same page,\u201d says guitarist Marcos Curiel. \u201cNow, everyone has the same attitude going forward, the same feeling we had when we did those first two first two big albums The Fundamental Elements of Southtown and Satellite.\u201d\nThe most startling aspect of Murdered Love lies in its diversity and the band\u2019s songwriting having penned every track on the album. The opener \u201cEyez\u201d might be the band\u2019s heaviest song yet, with a cameo by Hatebreed\u2019s Jamey Jasta. It contrasts sharply with \u201cWest Coast Rock Steady,\u201d a playful hip-hop ode to their San Diego roots featuring Sen Dog of Cypress Hill. Meanwhile, \u201cPanic & Run\u201d is full-tilt punk, \u201cBad Boy\u201d brings a funky swagger and first single \u201cLost in Forever\u201d ties it all together with an equal mix of aggressiveness and melody. \n\u201cThe band is a fusion of all our musical passions,\u201d says Curiel. \u201cWe can jump from punk to reggae to rap to metal. And funk -- people forget we had a little funk on our first few indie releases. So on a few songs here, we took it back. The whole process was really organic.\u201d \nLyrically, the record finds P.O.D. at its most thoughtful and introspective as the band contemplates their lives and the world around them.     On \u201cLost in Forever\u201d Sandoval shows a mixture of hope and unease to questioning the cruelty of man, as the band also does in the brutal title track \u201cMurdered Love.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s about people who have died when all they brought was love\u201d explains Curiel.   The sparse, catchy \u201cBeautiful,\u201d contemplates the afterlife while the teeth-rattling album closer \u201cI Am,\u201d finds Sandoval opening with the vivid line: \u201cI am the murderer, the pervert, sick to the core\u201d and never lets up. It\u2019s the band at its darkest and most confrontational. \n\u201cI had been doing a lot of outreach to kids, talking at a lot of schools,\u201d says the singer. \u201cI see what they go through \u2013 suicide, rape, addiction \u2013and that song is just about being vulnerable and honest. They\u2019re wondering if they\u2019re screw-ups, if they\u2019re deserving of love and compassion. \u201c\nThe band recorded Murdered Love with Grammy-nominated producer Howard Benson (Kelly Clarkson, My Chemical Romance, Daughtry), a long-time friend of the group and the man behind three of its biggest records. \u201cHe\u2019s family,\u201d says Sandoval, then laughs. \u201cHe has the power to choose who he wants to work with, and I think he wanted to go back and make a real rock record.\u201d\nTo promote the record, the band has already set up a late spring\/early summer headlining tour, as well as hitting a number of festivals and larger shows this year. \u201cIt seems like there\u2019s Warriors in every city,\u201d says Curiel, noting the band\u2019s affectionate nickname for their diehard fans. \u201cThey\u2019re loyal. And it\u2019s great, because we\u2019ll see people who loved us around the Satellite era bringing their kids.\u201d Given the closeness between the band and their fanbase, it\u2019s no surprise that P.O.D.\u2019s new logo was the result of an online contest with their fans.\nIn the end, Murdered Love showcases a band at its most energetic and vital, nearly two decades after its debut. Sandoval agrees. \n\u201cThis is the best record we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d says the singer. \u201cAnd that can only come from what we\u2019ve put into this.

{"about":"Est. 2009 in Athens, AL","band_members":"Brittany Howard\nHeath Fogg\nZac Cockrell\nSteve Johnson\nwith Ben Tanner on keys","bio":"The story of the Alabama Shakes begins in a high school psychology class in Athens, Alabama. Brittany Howard, who had started playing guitar a few years earlier, approached Zac Cockrell and asked if he wanted to try making music together. \"I just knew that he played bass and that he wore shirts with cool bands on them that nobody had heard of,\" says Howard.\n\nThey started to meet up after school and write songs sitting on Howard's floor. \"It had that rootsy feel, but there was some out-there stuff,\" says Cockrell. \"David Bowie-style things, prog-rock, lots of different stuff. We started to come across our own sound a little bit, though it's evolved a lot since then.\"\n\nSteve Johnson worked at the only music store in town, and Howard knew he played the drums. She invited him to a party where, she says, \"he met everybody from our side of the tracks.\" The three young musicians began working together, further expanding their style and approach. \"Steve is kind of a punk-metal drummer,\" says Howard, \"so we embraced that edge he brings to everything he does.\"\n\nThe trio soon went into a studio in Decatur to record some of the songs they were working up, and this proto-demo found its way into the hands of Heath Fogg, with whom Howard had been familiar because he had been the lead guitarist in what she describes as \"the best band in our high school.\" Fogg, who by now had graduated from college, asked them to open a show for his band, which they agreed to do\u2014on the condition that he play with them. The response was immediate: \"That first show was really explosive,\" says Howard.\u201d\n\nThough they had been focusing on original material (\"It's just more fun to write than to learn someone else's music,\" says Cockrell), as the band\u2014newly christened the Shakes\u2014began playing out, they added more cover songs. They played classics by James Brown and Otis Redding, but also by Led Zeppelin and AC\/DC. \"We had to find music we could all agree on and figure out how to play together,\" says Howard, \"and that had a lot of influence on how we play now.\"\n\nAttempting to record their songs with the honest sonic qualities they cherished, the Shakes bought a few microphones and a vintage Teac mixing board and set up in Howard's house\u2014which didn't work, since she lived right next to some railroad tracks. They eventually found their way to a Nashville studio in early 2011, where the songs they cut included \"You Ain't Alone\" and \"I Found You.\"\n\nWhen they appeared at a Nashville record store, people started to take notice of the group\u2019s relentless, hard-charging live attack, and Howard\u2019s magnetic stage presence. One especially ardent fan raved about the band to his friends, which included Justin Gage, the founder of the Aquarium Drunkard blog. Gage wrote to Howard, asking if he could post one of the Shakes' songs. She sent back the yearning, intense \"You Ain't Alone,\" which he put up in late July, calling it \"a slice of the real.\" And, literally overnight, all hell broke loose. \n\n\"I woke up the next day to emails from record labels, managers, publishing companies,\" says Howard. \"At first I thought, everybody's making a mistake!\" Gage also emailed \u201cYou Ain\u2019t Alone\u201d to the Drive-By Truckers' team. The band was immediately blown away and offered the Shakes an opening slot, sight unseen. (Patterson Hood of the Truckers later noted that the group \u201ctotally blew us off the stage in Winston-Salem.\u201d)\n\nYet even as the attention and the pressure were mounting, the band\u2014who by now had changed their name to the Alabama Shakes\u2014continued to break new ground musically. Their first single, the hypnotic, show-stopping plea \"Hold On,\" grew out of an on-stage improvisation. \"We threw out that riff,\" says Cockrell, \"and Brittany started singing along, and the crowd started singing with her like it was a song they already knew.\"\n\nIn October, the Shakes gave a performance at the CMJ Festival in New York City that earned a glowing review from the New York Times. Jon Pareles described the band as \"a thunderbolt dressed in bluejeans,\" with music that's \"aching when it\u2019s slow and growling and whooping when it\u2019s fast.\" NPR named them one of the best bands of 2011, while MTV called them one of the top bands to look for in 2012.\n\nAs word of mouth spread, more offers to tour came in, and the band members were finally able to quit their day jobs; until this point, all the writing, recording, and touring had to be done around such responsibilities as Howard's work as a mail carrier and Johnson\u2019s hours toiling as a night watchman at a nuclear power plant.\n\nNow, with expectations at fever pitch, the Alabama Shakes have delivered Boys & Girls\u2014six of the songs from that initial Nashville session, and another five recorded during the rest of the year. From the heart-rending title song to such stomps as \u201cRise to the Sun,\u201d the album demonstrates the sense of groove and space the band learned from their idols, along with a blistering force and emotion that simply can\u2019t be learned. \n\nOverwhelmed by the response they've already received, there is one perception of the band that they want to challenge. \"A lot of people think we're a soul revival act,\" says Cockrell. \"That's an honor to me, classic R&B is my favorite kind of music, but everybody has their own influences. Brittany is way more into rock and roll\u2014she likes things pretty amped up most of the time.\"\n\n\"Retro soul is not what we\u2019re going for, though it's understandable why people say it,\" says Howard. \"We take inspiration from that, but we all understand Black Sabbath, too. On the record, we left a lot of room for whatever we want to do in the future.\"\n\nThe release of Boys & Girls marks the arrival of a major new rock and roll band. To the members themselves, though, what's been most exciting has been the reaction they have felt on stage, whether tiny local dates or under the glare of the media.\n\n\"It seems like everyone can tell how into it we are,\" says Cockrell. \"Every show, people say they can feel how much we love what we're doing.\"\n","booking_agent":"North America: Matt Hickey - matt\u0040highroadtouring.com \/ Europe: Angus Baskerville - angus.baskerville\u004013artists.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"ATHENS, AL","description":"WATCH AS THE SHAKES PULL SHAPES AND BEND SPOONS WITH 42 DECIBELS OF STEEL,TUBE AND RAW HUMAN LUNG POWER.

{"about":"www.peterbjornandjohn.com","band_members":"Peter Mor\u00e9n  \nBj\u00f6rn Yttling \nJohn Eriksson","bio":"Peter Mor\u00e9n from Dalarna in the North of Sweden and Bj\u00f6rn Yttling from V\u00e4sterbotten - even further to the North - had been playing music together for 8 years when they in 1999 met John - from Norrbotten - which would you believe it is yet even further to the North! \n\nThe following year they started a band and simply called it Peter, Bjorn and John - not due to lack of better names - but because it felt right. Band names are often ridiculous - so why not just go for your own name? First they thought that they would recruit a bass player but after the well known saying \"3 is a crowd\" thus more than enough - the keyboard player Bj\u00f6rn began playing bass. Live the band have learned to use the little format to its advantage and in the studio well let's just say they have been known to do overdubs...! \n\nInitially all the press they got had to do with Bj\u00f6rn's production CV and the members different guest appearances on other more well known bands and artists records. But soon that would change. \n\nIn 2002 the home recorded self titled debut album was released and received comments from the press regarding \"superior sound beds\" and \"upcoming classics\" while songs like \"Matchmaker\" and \"People They Know\" became favourites with the indie pop crowd. Rough Trade in London even penned \"nothing else sounds as good in Swedish pop right now\" and were probably not completely mistaken. \n\n2004 saw the follow up with the more complete, mature and darker \"Falling Out\". \"It beats me everytime\" became a Swedish radio hit and the album was released Stateside the following year to press acclaim. Allmusic.com gave the album 4,5 stars and wrote: \"very close to the best indie rock -- no, just plain music -- being made in 2005. More punk than the Concretes, less frantic than Shout Out Louds, as catchy as the most tuneful of the UK post-post-post-punk merchants. Falling Out firmly established Peter, Bjorn and John as a group to watch out for. Strike that. They are a band that has arrived in all senses of the word\". \n\nNow in 2006 PBJ embark on the second phase of their careers. The new album \"Writer's Block\" (recorded in Bj\u00f6rn's studio in Hornstull,Stockholm) is the first to showcase all three members as songwriters and taking on lead vocalist duties and sees the band take on a new musical direction. \n","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Pop","hometown":"North Sweden","is_published":true,"record_label":"Startime\/Columbia + Cooking Vinyl","talking_about_count":2843,"username":"peterbjornandjohn","website":"www.peterbjornandjohn.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"6350103693","name":"Peter Bjorn and John","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/peterbjornandjohn","likes":335425,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152126227723694","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/994979_10152126227723694_1784382322_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Pronounced \u201calt-J\u201d, the delta sign is created when you hold down the alt key on your computer keyboard and punch \u2018J\u2019 on a Mac computer. The symbol has a deeper meaning for the band, as guitarist\/bassist Gwil Sainsbury notes, \u201cin mathematical equations it\u2019s used to show change,\u201d and the band\u2019s relatively new name came at a turning point in their lives. \n\nGwil, Joe Newman [guitar\/vocals], Gus Unger-Hamilton [keyboards] and Thom Green [drums] met at Leeds University in 2007. Gus studied English Literature; the other three Fine Art. In their second year of studies, Joe played Gwil a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Gwil acting as producer on Garageband. \n\nNeedless to say, the response to Joe\u2019s hushed falsetto yelps and Gwil\u2019s rudimentary sampling skills was good. When Thom was played the tracks he joined the band straight away. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard anything like it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was music I was looking for, I just didn\u2019t know I was. I just loved it.\u201d\n\nGus completed the band\u2019s lineup and together \u2013 first as Daljit Dhaliwal and then as Films \u2013 the four friends spent the next two years playing around town, developing a precise and unique brand of alt. pop that draws on poignant folk verses, crushing synths, smart hip hop syncopations and tight vocal harmonies. They dropped the moniker of Films in 2007, largely to avoid confusing the band with Californian punk troupe The Films. alt-J (\u2206) gave them a unique name to go with the unique \u2018folk-step\u2019 that they now concoct in the basement of a terrace house in Cambridgeshire.","booking_agent":"UK - Primary Talent International: nick\u0040primarytalent.com \/ matt\u0040primarytalent.com   America - The Windish Agency: tom\u0040windishagency.com","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"East City Management","hometown":"Leeds","influences":"Haha","is_published":true,"press_contact":"UK - Print \/ Online: caroline\u0040insideslashout.com \/ Regional: iancheek\u0040talk21.com \/ Radio: promo\u0040ajpr.co.uk \/ Regional radio: jessica\u0040radioactivepromotions.co.uk \/ Licensing: karen\u0040infectiousmusicuk.com \/\/ USA - Print \/ Online: jim\u0040bighassle.com","talking_about_count":13813,"username":"altJ.band","website":"www.altjband.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"200859576615757","name":"Alt-J","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/altJ.band","likes":710811,"cover":{"cover_id":457862364248809,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/532499_457862364248809_1332334650_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

John and Simon worked together at NaNa's shoe store in California. They decided to form a band and needed a drummer, so they asked Darrin who was working at the local Starbucks to listen to a tape they had made. The day he heard it he was air drumming along with it all day, he loved it! At this time, Goldfinger's original guitarist left to the band to become a pro surfer in Costa Rica, where he still lives. John had a good friend named Charlie who played guitar and he thought he would be a great replacement on guitar. \n\nCharlie's first show with Goldfinger was a little hectic, he was given a tape of the songs on Friday night, practiced with the band on Saturday and played a show that night. Goldfinger were now recording their Demo EP called \"richter\", it was given amazing reviews and they were getting good indie\/college radio airplay. Goldfinger were now given the oppurtunity to record the S\/T debut LP. They recorded the cd in 1995 and it was released in spring on 1996, their first single\/video \"Here in your Bedroom\" was played at a high rate and they gained in popularity. Goldfinger also released videos for \"Mable\" and \"Only a Day\".\n\nIn 1996 Goldfinger played more shows than there are days...they toured with such bands as the Sex Pistols, No Doubt, Vans Warped Tour, and Reel Big Fish. In 1997 Goldfinger released their second LP entitled \"Hang-Up's\" their first single \"This Lonely Place\" was not as big a success as the release of \"Here in your Bedroom\", but it did give them numerous live talk show apperances and spins of the video, which is a play on \"Alien\". Goldfinger also released a video for the single \"More Today than Yesterday\" a cover of the Spiral Staircase song. Which can be found on the \"Waterboy\" soundtrack.\n\nIn the summer of 1998, Simon left the band due to musical differences. He was replaced by John's old band mate from the Electric Love Hogs. And more recently the bassist for 22jacks a band that opened for Goldfinger on many tours. Goldfinger Released their second EP in the Fall on '99 Called. \"Darrin's Coconut Ass-Live From Omaha\" The EP contains 8 songs which are all covers. In the Spring on 2000 Goldfinger released their 3rd LP called \"Stomping Ground\" the single in North America was \"Counting the Days\" while Europe was invaded with \"99 Red Balloons\". The band has been touring since the release of Stomping Ground with such bands as: Eve6, Showoff, BloodHound Gang, and Mest.\n\nIn 2002 Charlie left the band and was replaced by Brian Arthur, formerly of Unloco. Brian joined the band just before the released of their 2003 cd called \"Open Your Eyes\" which was released on Jive\/Zoomba. The band toured in support with large acts like Sum41 and Good Charlotte. The band toured on and off until 2005 when they released \"Disconnection Notice\" on Maverick Records and toured Europe, Australia, and North America in support. In mid-2005 the band released Brian Arthur of duties on guitar and replaced him with ex-guitarist Charlie Paulson. Since Charlies' return the band has been playing a handful of shows and done a few small tours. In 2007 Goldfinger finished the recording of their next cd which was released in 2008 on Sideone Dummy called \"Hello Destiny\". To promote the album, the band embarked on a successful North American tour with Less Than Jake in summer of 2008. They also played in the UK at the Reading and Leeds Festivals on 22\u201323 August 2008.\n\nRecently, frontman John Feldmann has produced records for Mest, The Used (whose vocalist Bert McCracken sang some guest vocals on \"Open Your Eyes\", \"Woodchuck\", \"Ocean Size\", and \"Handjobs for Jesus\"), Hilary Duff and Story of the Year. He also produced Good Charlotte's single \"The Anthem\" (whose guitarist Benji Madden provides guest vocals on \"January\".. \n\n\"99 Red Balloons\" is featured in Not Another Teen Movie, Eurotrip, the video game Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec, and along with their cover of The Spiral Starecase's \"More Today Than Yesterday\", during the ending credits of The Waterboy . \"Superman\" is featured in the comedy Kingpin. \"Walking in the Dark\" is featured in the movie Dead Man on Campus.\n\nThe band's video game debut was in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater with the song \"Superman\".

{"about":"Download \"The Truth Is...\" on iTunes here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/TOADMTheTruthIs","band_members":"- Tyler Connolly - Vocals\/Guitar\n- Dean Back - Bass\n- David Brenner - Guitar","bio":"Honesty is always the best policy. Theory of a Deadman adheres to that age old adage on their fourth album for Roadrunner\/604 Records, The Truth Is\u2026\n \n\nThe platinum-selling Vancouver quartet builds arena-ready hooks around hard rocking stories of good times, bad times and everything in between. \u201cLowlife,\" is a raucous anthem celebrating simple pleasures. Meanwhile, \"The Bitch Came Back\" gives a hilarious send-off to a bad ex with roaring guitars and flourishes of horns. \"Hurricane\" stirs up a storm of emotions over an orchestral hum of guitars and massive chorus. Then there's \"Head Above Water,\" which delivers an uplifting, contemplative message encased in mid-tempo rhythms. Theory of a Deadman\u2014Tyler Connolly [Lead Vocals, Lead Guitar], David Brenner [Rhythm Guitar], Dean Back [Bass], Joey Dandeneau [Drums]\u2014are telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth, like it or not.\n \n\nFor The Truth Is\u2026, Theory of a Deadman preserved the sound that fans worldwide have grown to love on Scars & Souvenirs [2008], Gasoline [2005], and Theory of a Deadman [2002], while expanding, enhancing, and evolving their approach. The band solidified their place at the top of modern hard rock by exceeding Platinum sales with their breakthrough Scars & Souvenirs and with #1 Mainstream Rock Radio hit \"Bad Girlfriend.\"At the same time, other singles, \"So Happy\" and \"By The Way,\" became crowd favorites on tours with everyone from M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Godsmack to Daughtry and label mates Stone Sour. For The Truth Is\u2026 the band stuck to what works best and are taking it to the next level.\n \n\n\"Musically, not too much changed,\" says Connolly. \"We had a bit of an epiphany when it came to songwriting though. We've been a band for over a decade now, and we realized what we're doing makes sense. There was a lot more confidence. I was able to dig in lyrically and be wide open. When I write, I either want to kiss someone on the lips or punch them in the face. Anything in between is boring.\"\n \n\nTo capture those two ends of the spectrum, the band hunkered down once again in Los Angeles\u2019 Bay 7 studio during January 2011 with Howard Benson [My Chemical Romance, 3 Doors Down]. Brenner adds, \"We really found our sound on Scars & Souvenirs.\"\n \n\n\"Lowlife\" pulsates with stadium-sized energy, and it tells a clever tale in the process. Connolly reveals, \"I thought it'd be cool to write a fun anthem about being a lowlife. It's okay to drive an old piece of shit car, get arrested and be a dirtball. Our fans aren't wearing suits and ties. They don't have diamond necklaces. They're regular people who like to party and sing rock 'n' roll music. The song speaks to them.\"\n \n\nElsewhere, Theory sneak in some humorous jabs on \"The Bitch Came Back,\" a song that exudes a theatrical swagger with a rousing chorus and propulsive riff. The song began in a fashion that saw Theory reaching way back. \u201cWe love to mess around and try things, and we tried horns here. Horns can be rock 'n' roll,\" says Brenner. \n \n\nTheory makes the horns sound very rock 'n' roll especially when they're wrapped in soaring distortion. For Connolly, these songs came from one of the most intense periods of his life. \u201cThere are a lot of lyrics that came from going through the roughest period of my life. I don't think I've ever been that beat up physically and emotionally. It took me awhile to get better, but as a result, this record is the best work that we've done,\" he said.\n \n\nUltimately, The Truth Is... stands out as the band's best work to date because it's about a shared experience with the audience for Connolly and Co at the end of the day. The frontman concludes, \"I want to make a great song that can help get fans through hard times. I want them to take that music with them for the rest of their lives. I'm trying to write songs and change people, make them laugh, smile, or sing along. That's what I'm looking for.\"\n \n\nThe Truth Is\u2026 Theory of a Deadman found it.

{"about":"New Album \"Life Turns Electric\" Available Now - http:\/\/ow.ly\/hRaDK and http:\/\/www.fingereleven.com\/","band_members":"Vocals: Scott Anderson\nGuitar: James Black\nGuitar: Rick Jackett\nBass: Sean Anderson\n\n","bio":"After five albums and countless tours, Finger Eleven have made their big rock record. It's loud, powerful and fast. It's the album they've waited their entire career to make.\n\nLife Turns Electric is the sound of Finger Eleven's pedal to the proverbial metal. They fly past state troopers and speed traps. They barrel headlong into the future but take a scenic route through the dusty roads of the \u201870s to get there. There's nothing retro about it, but you can hear how they've inhaled the fumes of Classic Rock. This is the sound of a band blasting forward and having a blast while doing so. The guitars are back, the melodies are strong and instantly memorable, branding the lyrics on your brain the very first time you hear them.\n\n\"Some bands get confident and coast,\" says Scott. \"They might put out the first 10 ideas they think of and that isn't what happened here.\" It's true. Finger Eleven grew confident through fan support and belief in their music and instead of coasting, they're simply more confident with their craft. On Life Turns Electric, that fact is clear. They didn't just put out the first ten jams they came up with \u2013 they put out ten of the best songs they've ever written.\n\nFinger Eleven earned this confidence album by album, tour by tour and song by song. Since signing to Wind-Up records in 1998, the band have worked the road non-stop and released successful albums such as their debut Tip and its follow-up, The Greyest of Blue Skies. By the time they released their third, self-titled album, Finger Eleven had built a solid career. They didn't know that a little acoustic tune, written unassumingly under a tree somewhere, would be the one to crack the charts open and let them onto roads once closed to them. \"One Thing,\" with its powerful chorus and acoustics, became a sensation.\n\nThe band's new success gave them the confidence to write Them vs You vs Me, the Gold-certified album that won Rock Album of the Year at the 2007 Junos. Them vs You vs Me was even more musically varied than Finger Eleven. Them vs You vs Me also featured \"Paralyzer,\" a monster slab of backbone slide that became the band's biggest crossover hit. It's all funk and swagger with no best-before date, and it blasts out of car windows and club doors to this very day.\n\nTheir albums were going gold in the U.S., platinum in Canada. Their songs were on Guitar Hero and Rock Band and other video games and soundtracks. Finger Eleven's hits proved the band could be a hard rock band, an acoustic band, a funk rock band, all of these -or none of these. All they had to do was be true to themselves as Finger Eleven and both casual and hardcore fans would approve. They knew they were ready to make Life Turns Electric.\n\nFirst, though, the band took some time apart to recharge - although Finger Eleven never shut down completely. Ideas continually evolve and revolve inside their heads. Eventually they brought their ideas to a cabin in the Canadian north to pull them out, lay them down and hammer them into properly righteous shape.\n\n\"When we're together, it's almost like we're a machine,\" says James. \"Someone just drops a token in and everyone's gears start moving.\"\n\nThey emerged from the wilderness with their best batch of songs to date, and headed down to Wind-Up's own Quad Studios in New York City. They had something new in mind \u2013 a new attitude and a new method. After years in studios learning the ropes, they were ready to self-produce. They had honed their skills with home recordings and pitched in ideas with past producers. With the other band members at their side, Rick and James knew they could guide Finger Eleven through the making of their fifth album. They took their first test run with \"Living In A Dream,\" the lead single with the mad groove and the crazy-memorable chorus. The result? A smash single already following \"Paralyzer\" up the Hot 100. \"Living In A Dream\" gave them the go-ahead to make the album they saw fit to make.\n\nThe band moved to New York City to live and breathe the music. The crackle and buzz of that city's streets is audible on Life Turns Electric. They turned up guitars and sped up the tempo; great songs with less juice were put aside for future use. Life Turns Electric was going to be about the rock.\n\n\"We chose to just rock this out,\" says Rick. \"We concentrated on the chords and the melodies.\" New York helped them do that, supercharging the already-electrified grooves, powering the melodies, pushing the band forward.\n\n\"We'd leave the studio at night and go out to the Whiskey Rebel,\" explains Sean. \"They had a juke box there, and the songs we picked were straight-up Classic Rock standards.\" It was here that the band tweaked just by talking about them, exchanging ideas at 3 a.m. It was just five guys, a juke box, and the excitement of talking about music. By the time they hit the studio the next day, they were ready to play with renewed energy.\n\n\"For younger bands, that red studio light going on can be frightening,\" says Rich. \"For us, at this point, all the red light means is go.\"\n\nAs producers, Rick and James mediated the recording process, but through the sessions, everyone had their say. The sessions were a team effort, and the results were sifted through no filters, refracted through no prisms, and compromised by nothing. In an era when records are divided into \u2018singles' and \u2018the rest of it,' Life Turns Electric is the full package; the songs are even stronger side by side.\n\nLife Turns Electric sounds exactly the way the band wanted it to sound \u2013 like pure, uncut Finger Eleven.","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Alternative Rock","hometown":"Burlington, ON","is_published":true,"record_label":"Wind-up Records","talking_about_count":2987,"username":"FingerEleven","website":"Official: http:\/\/www.fingereleven.com Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/group.php?gid=2210362974 http:\/\/twitter.com\/finger_eleven MySpace: http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/fingereleven YouTube: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/fingervision","were_here_count":0,"id":"6134437571","name":"Finger Eleven (F11)","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FingerEleven","likes":538023,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150649436162572","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/293054_10150649436162572_1338747485_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The New Album 'Renacer' Available Now. Download on iTunes http:\/\/smarturl.it\/reanceritunes ","band_members":"Buddy Nielsen - Vocals\/BJJ Blue Belt\n\nMatt Smith - Guitar\/ surfing\n\nDan Trapp - Drums\/Flute\n\nJason Black - Bass\/BassPlayer Magazine Subscription\n\nZack Roach - Guitar\/SNES","bio":"Listening to a new Senses Fail album is a lot like reconnecting with an old friend\u2014although there\u2019s a comforting, indefinable familiarity within all of the New Jersey-based post-hardcore quintet\u2019s records, each new creation is a fleeting snapshot of the lives of its makers, indelibly capturing the things that meant the most during your mutual time apart. The band\u2019s third full-length release, Life Is Not A Waiting Room, is no exception. Having the unenviable task of following 2006\u2019s crushing Still Searching, the album showcases the face-melting musicianship and soul-baring lyricism that define Senses Fail. Once again produced by helmsman Brian McTernan (Thrice, Circa Survive) and recorded in Baltimore, MD, at his Salad Days studio, Life boasts a towering sound akin to a roundhouse kick to the skull. \u201cThis is the most fun we\u2019ve ever had as a band,\u201d says singer James \u201cBuddy\u201d Nielsen. \u201cI think we were feeling a lot less pressure this time around, but you\u2019ve always got to do your best.\u201d The New Jersey-based group formed six years ago and released their debut EP, From the Depths of Dreams, in 2002. 2004's Let It Enfold You\u2014their first full-length\u2014was followed by Still Searching, which debuted at 15 on the Billboard Top 200 chart. To date, Senses Fail have performed multiple worldwide tours and their catalog sales have reached over 850,000, yet the band continue to evolve. Although in many ways Life picks up seamlessly where Searching left off, the new album has very distinct, unique qualities, most notably its lyrical content. While Searching wrestled with issues regarding religion and depression, Life is centered squarely on a crumbling relationship, and the desire to see meaningful change. \u201cA lot of this record is written about the recent break up I had with a long-time girlfriend, the first person I have ever been in love with, and someone I spent a lot of time and shared my transition from kid to adult,\u201d explains Nielsen. \u201cThe other elements of the record consist of regrets and how they can leave a burning hole in your soul; how the past is something you can\u2019t change\u2026.There are also bright moments where I find myself coming to terms with those very facts, and in knowing the problem you can then be proactive and change.\u201d Life also marks the addition of new bassist Jason Black (formerly of Hot Water Music), who replaces the departed Mike Glita. Meanwhile, guitarists Garrett Zablocki and Heath Saraceno (formerly of Midtown) have grown into one of the most scorching six-string tandems around; Life features more of the nimble harmonies showcased on Searching, but this time the duo took it one step further, with some truly shred-a-riffic leads, such as those heard on \u201cLungs Like Gallows\u201d and \u201cGarden State.\u201d Another rocker, \u201cWolves At The Door,\u201d was so intense that it even garnered a coveted spot within the soundtrack for the best-selling Madden NFL \u201809 video game. Kicking off with the rich, moody \u201cFireworks At Dawn,\u201d Life roars and pummels its way through the album\u2019s 12 tracks without the slightest pause for filler, delivering an absolute haymaker just four tracks in with \u201cFamily Tradition,\u201d which features the band\u2019s signature blend of dark and melodic. Nielsen\u2019s words are as insightful as they are meaningful. \u201cI find myself at times doing things to live up to other peoples\u2019 expectations, or cutting myself down because I assume that will make me look more humble to the world,\u201d says Nielsen. \u201cSo this song is one part a reaction to that, and also about following the footsteps of a family member you don't really know, but who has had a huge influence on you.\u201d Perhaps the most heart-wrenching moments of all come via the two-part song cycle of \u201cYellow Angels\u201d and \u201cFour Years,\u201d which were inspired by a terminally ill fan named Marcel, who befriended Nielsen at an SF show in Dallas, TX. Nielsen remained in contact with the 18-year-old, who was stricken with cancer of the soft tissue of his face, and endured many painful surgeries and treatments in order to attempt to fend off tumors that were growing in vital areas such as his eyes, nose and throat. When Marcel\u2019s mother notified Nielsen of her son\u2019s worsening condition, the singer flew to Texas, where he spent a great deal of time with this incredibly courageous young man, during the final days of his tragically short life. \u201cIt was one of the most intense and stirring times in my life. The sheer pain this 18-year-old boy was in was mind blowing, yet his optimistic outlook and sense of humor was steadfast,\u201d Nielsen recalls. \u201cThis kid changed my life and although he is no longer with us, he lives on everyday in the pictures I took with him, to remind myself that life is never as bad as you think it is. So \u2018Yellow Angels\u2019 is my reaction to meeting Marcel and how I needed to live in the moment and love myself and life. \u2018Four Years,\u2019 on the other hand, is about being influenced by such a life-changing [experience] and having to make new decisions about my relationship and what it really was.\u201d The album\u2019s title is a succinct, encapsulating statement as to its thematic thrust. Life Is Not A Waiting Room is just as much revelation as it is reflection; the sum total of every ounce of pain, fear, hope and joy that the record exudes. \u201cI felt I had been living as if I was waiting for something to happen, but I know that is the wrong way to live\u2014it just doesn't promote any sort of happiness,\u201d Nielsen concludes. \u201cThe title sums up the direction I want to go in, and what I want to get away from, and it\u2019s a cry to everyone else to stop living like I have.\u201d Just like the rest of us, Nielsen\u2019s struggle is far from over. But one thing is certain: SF have once again delivered their message with both passion and fury. All one has to do is listen with their ears and heart open\u2014just as an old friend would.\n\nRead more: http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/sensesfail#ixzz0rMiPyTdl","booking_agent":"US\/AUS\/ASIA - Andrew Ellis - aellis\u0040apanewyork.com UK\/Europe - Ross Warnock &  Anna Bewers - rosswarnock\u0040theagencygroup.com - annabewers\u0040theagencygroup.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"NJ","general_manager":"wayne\u0040workhorsemusic.com","genre":"Punk, Rock, Screamo","hometown":"NJ","is_published":true,"record_label":"Staple Records","talking_about_count":5358,"username":"sensesfail","website":"www.kingsroadmerch.com\/sensesfail www.sensesfail.com www.twitter.com\/sensesfail","were_here_count":0,"id":"132975026721268","name":"Senses Fail","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sensesfail","likes":504819,"cover":{"cover_id":573734809311952,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc1\/s720x720\/5269_573734809311952_2098575885_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Official Page for Crossfade!  New Album 'We All Bleed' out now! ","band_members":"Ed Sloan: Lead Vocals, Guitar\nLes Hall: Lead Guitar, Keys, Vocals\nMitch James: Bass, Vocals\n\n","bio":"Crossfade may not have conquered all of its demons, but the band is sounding a vehement battle cry.\n\nThe Columbia, S.C., outfit\u2019s third album, due on Eleven Seven Music in July, delves into familiar lyrical themes of betrayal and isolation\u2014but there\u2019s also more than a hint of renewal and resolution.\n\n\u201cA lot has changed over the past three years,\u201d offers lead vocalist and co-songwriter Ed Sloan. \u201cBeing down and out is something I\u2019ve had to confront like never before. There\u2019s been pain, but I\u2019ve also learned to dwell less on the negative, so there\u2019s a feeling of rebirth, too.\u201d\n\nThe set\u2019s 10 tracks, produced by the band, maintain the sonic thunderclap of Crossfade\u2019s previous efforts, while propelling its guitar-grinding signature with a tapestry of orchestration and programming, and a flourish of keyboards, thanks to the addition of Les Hall to the permanent line-up, alongside Sloan, bassist Mitch James and drummer Will Hunt.\n\nThe evolution marks a tidal shift in Sloan\u2019s previous role as Crossfade\u2019s singular commandeering voice, but he is the first to admit that sharing duties with Hall was an organic, if not essential benchmark in the band\u2019s growth.\n\nThe pair has been buddies since the seventh grade in South Carolina, where they were both regarded as young guitar prodigies. As an adult, Hall was writing music for film scores and serving as a session and touring musician for the likes of Trey Anastasio and 70 Volt Parade, Howie Day and a number of local Columbia, S.C., acts. In 2006, \u201cI randomly stopped by Eddie\u2019s studio to hear tracks for Crossfade\u2019s second album, and he told me they needed an additional guitar player to tour,\u201d Hall says. \u201cI learned both albums in a day and played through one song with the band and that was it; we went out and did our first show together. It immediately felt like home, playing this heavy stuff with your brothers.\u201d\n\nHall longed to contribute in a fulltime role with the group\u2014as a songwriter, guitarist, keyboardist and arranger\u2014which Sloan embraced. \u201cI had to decide whether to tour with another band and collect a paycheck, or invest in something I really believed in,\u201d Hall says. \u201cEddie and I had such a bond and mutual respect for each other. I told him I\u2019d quit everything else and join the group if I could be part of the writing.\u201d\n\nCrossfade\u2019s debut self-titled, self-produced album was released on Columbia Records in 2004, which spawned top 10 Mainstream Rock hits \u201cCold,\u201d \u201cSo Far Away\u201d and \u201cColors\u201d\u2014propelling the album to platinum status. Follow-up 2006 disc \u201cFalling Away,\u201d fostered hits \u201cInvincible\u201d and \u201cDrown You Out,\u201d but with second album sales down amid an industry-wide slump in the music business, the band was cut from the roster.\n\nBeing dropped by Columbia choked Sloan\u2019s creative momentum. He admits, \u201cComing from the success of the first record and losing our way after the second album hit me hard. You get signed, everything is golden and you think it\u2019ll go on forever. After we were dropped, I was consumed with self-doubt. Music had always been my escape, a friend, but then, music became my enemy. I shut down as a songwriter\u2014and actually, pretty much as a human being.\n\n\u201cLes came in, took me by the boot straps and helped me to step forward,\u201d Sloan adds. \u201cAfter a year of me self-medicating, he just said, \u2018We\u2019re going to write about this and make a third album,\u2019 which forced some of these songs that talk about the dark side of life. Les had a big part in rejuvenating my soul, to get out of my slump and focus on music again. He helped me to live my life\u2014and write about it in the moment. It was therapeutic and an inspiration. He woke me from my musical coma.\u201d\n\nThe collaborative effort continued to pay off throughout the creative process. With previous efforts, Sloan would record his vocals to Crossfade\u2019s instrumental tracks in solitary confinement. \u201cI\u2019d hit record, run back and listen. But this time, I sang into the mic with a brother on the other side. I would spend four hours getting out what was in my heart, as Les made sure every line was great.\u201d\n\nBecause it was Hall\u2019s first hands-on run at recording a full album, \u201cLes had a lot to say. He\u2019s an amazing musician, very skilled on guitar and keyboards, and his programming savvy is awesome,\u201d Sloan says. \u201cHe brought in so much sonic goodness. Over the course of a year and a half, he transformed bits and pieces of songs that were near and dear to my heart into masterpieces. We shared such a similar mindset and it became a much more personal experience.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Hall says his mandate with the album was to keep Sloan\u2019s familiar vocals front and center, while cultivating a distinctive new production stamp for Crossfade. He says, \u201cThe common threads were Eddie's voice and knowing that we still wanted songs with a message and as strong a sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly, I had no interest in creating the same sound,\u201d Hall notes. \u201cThe goal was to discover something fresh that felt real. I\u2019m not a fan of bare bones mixes, so I wanted to help Eddie make this epic, with a lot to hear, all packaged around a well-written song. If we had focused on what the band was and tried to recreate that, I don\u2019t believe the songs would have come out right. When you have no limits, no expectations, things come out better.\u201d\n\nHighlights on the third album include \u201cDear Cocaine,\u201d a slow burner that addresses letting go of addiction; \u201cI Think You Should Know,\u201d offering a deceptively temperate arrangement behind a lyric about escaping reality by retreating in sleep; and \u201cKilling Me Inside,\u201d a straightforward assailing classic Crossfade rock \u2018n\u2019 roll anthem, albeit with a touch of crafty orchestration.\n\nSloan and Hall maintain that cutting the ties associated with a major label also helped to charter that new path. \u201cIt was a fresh start. We spent two years writing whatever we wanted, with no expectations, no deadline,\u201d Sloan says. \u201cWho knew if we would even release another record? It was a blast to have no obligation to copy the past.\u201d\n\nSloan also lends credit to bassist Mitch James. \u201cHe\u2019s been very patient over the last few years as a friend and confidante. He had a number of suggestions that helped us turn things around, and I respect him as a brother and friend that has been with the band since its inception.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Sloan is convinced that followers of Crossfade will find comfort in familiar lyrical themes, while appreciating the new aural amplitude. \u201cCrossfade fans will hear and feel the things they know from us,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s pouring out our hearts, as we\u2019ve always done. But sonically, there is a new inflection. As a band, we have been reborn. We\u2019ve always been dark, and people need that as a backdrop to things they\u2019re enduring in their lives, but I like to think it\u2019s poignant, too. There\u2019s a new level of positivity that gets you ready to face the day.\u201d","booking_agent":"Pinnacle Ent.","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Columbia, SC","genre":"Rock","hometown":"Columbia, South Carolina","is_published":true,"record_label":"Eleven Seven Music","release_date":"June 21, 2011","talking_about_count":2602,"username":"crossfadeband","website":"http:\/\/www.crossfadeband.com\/ http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/crossfademusic http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/crossfade http:\/\/www.YouTube.com\/user\/crossfademusictv","were_here_count":0,"id":"110697615637852","name":"Crossfade Official","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/crossfadeband","likes":342063,"cover":{"cover_id":383104931730451,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/306289_383104931730451_2026068379_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Este disco que es considerado por algunos medios y fans como el mas importante en su genero en Mexico, que los coloco en el estatus de culto. \nEn el 2003 DM se toma un receso de varios a\u00f1os debido a intereses personales de cada uno de los integrantes, y es hasta Mayo del 2006 que aparece su segundo y tan esperado disco titulado \"Defecto Perfecto\", de donde se desprende el primer sencillo \"Sismo\" en el que se puede escuchar una evolucion muy notoria de la banda que es reflejado de igual manera en todo el album. Posteriormente se desprenden \"Veneno es Antidoto (S.O.S.)\" como segundo sencillo y la balada \"Sognare\" que se coloco en los primeros lugares por meses consecutivos y llevo a Division a oidos de nuevo publico y escenarios aun mas grandes. \"Defecto Perfecto\" tiene a su cuenta un Disco de Oro y cinco nominaciones de los premios MTV de los cuales se llevo uno a \"Mejor Artista Norte\".\nEn Agosto 2008 lanzan al mercado su tercer y mas reciente album titulado \"Sirenas\", producido por Division, grabado y mezclado por Robert Carranza (Supergrass, Mars Volta, Los Lobos, Beck, Jack Jonhson, Molotov, etc.). El disco muestra nuevamente un significativo cambio en la banda, denotando influencias de un rock mas classico, con tintes de countryrock y con la fuerza y actitud ya conocida de Division.

{"about":"New Album 'Evil Friends' Available Now http:\/\/smarturl.it\/evilfriends\nWatch the video for Modern Jesus http:\/\/youtu.be\/q8e1sSNsf44\n","band_interests":"being nerds, making music","band_members":"John Baldwin Gourley, Zachary Scott Carothers, Kyle O'Quin, Kane Ritchotte","bio":"Evil Friends\n\nIt was last spring 2012, and John Gourley\u2014frontman of Portugal. The Man\u2014found himself in New York City about to ring the bell at Danger Mouse\u2019s apartment--a long way from his current home in Portland, and farther still from his real home in Alaska. Six full-length albums in six years, nonstop touring, a stint with The Black Keys and festival stops at Coachella, Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza\u2014up until this moment, Portugal. The Man embodied all dimensions of DIY rock range. \n\nWhen it came time to begin work on the seventh album, Gourley thought long and hard about the next move and kept coming back to one concept: The most satisfying work is collaborative work. From building houses with his father in Alaska to building a devoted fanbase, he had sought partnerships. So he took a bold step \u2014 bold for a proven band, bolder still for its uncertainty of sound \u2014 a step up to the apartment of a possible collaborator, Danger Mouse.\n\n\u201cI walked into his place,\u201d Gourley remembers now. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t going to happen.  He was like, \u2018Hey, man, just so you know, I don\u2019t really want to record a rock band.\u2019 And I was a little relieved.  We\u2019d done this by ourselves before, and we knew we could do it by ourselves again.\u201d\n\nBut then they got to listening, and to talking about how much Danger Mouse had loved In the Mountain in the Cloud \u2014 the 2011 followup to Portugal. The Man\u2019s break out record The Satanic Satanist. \u201cFrom that very first meeting,\u201d says Danger Mouse, \u201cwe were very ambitious about what we could do\u2026otherwise there was no point. So we decided: Let\u2019s try and make something really special.\u201d\n\nSo Danger Mouse \u2014 aka Brian Burton, the five-time Grammy award winning producer behind everything from Gnarls Barkley and Beck to The Black Keys and now U2 \u2014and the band agreed that they were game for the challenge and began production on what would become Evil Friends, the undaunted re-awakening for Portugal. The Man. As much as their collaborative imaginations melded, to construct songs that lived up to the ambitious visions they had would take some time. After all, here was a band with an evolving lineup \u2014 Kyle O\u2019Quin on keyboards, Noah Gersh on guitar\/percussion\/keyboards, and Kane Ritchotte on drums joined Zach Carothers on bass and vocals and Gourley on lead vocals and guitar \u2014 building new songs with a new producer trying to do something neither of them had done before.\n\nThey went, together, to Los Angeles and worked through several sessions \u2014 at Mondo Studios, Eltro Vox Studios, and Kingsize Soundlabs.  The band worked months longer than they ever had on one thing. And somehow \u2014 maybe it was the collaboration in the air, or maybe sheer will \u2014 they finally stopped searching and started realizing: \u201cWhat really brought our record together was getting past that period of looking for something, and figuring out how to do something really new, really hard, and really satisfying,\u201d said Gourley.\n\nEach track on Evil Friends is as different from the next as Portugal. The Man\u2019s previous records were from each other, which is to say a piece of a growing mindscape, and wholly a part of the group\u2019s tumbling fever dream. Where the 2009 hit \u201cPeople Say\u201d was a cheery guitar rally, the new title track is a bells-and-balls ballad emerging from darkness into a pipe-whistling punky thump, albeit with Gourley\u2019s trademark falsetto and thundering guitar. And yet here is Evil Friends swirling, like a tornado that sends a napping child toward Oz, into something of a tale of Portugal. The Man\u2019s arousal from when it decided to make something special to when it actually did: The weighted down questions of \u201cPlastic Soldiers\u201d (Could it be we got lost in the summer? \/ Well I know you know that it\u2019s over) give way to the confident melodies of \u201cModern Jesus\u201d (The only rule we need is never giving up \/ The only faith we have is faith in us) and finally, brazenly, to the anthem \u201cSmile\u201d (We watched the sun come up \/ But took it down to hide it \/ Seems like the spring has come and gone \/ It felt like forever).\n\nIt took all year, and Portugal. The Man \u2014 a group guaranteed for seven years to pump out a record, to tour and tour and tour, to tuck its fans to bed at night with a community of psychedelic  rock \u2014 had learned to slow down and transform all-day, all-night recording with Danger Mouse into adrenaline, into words that are at once dark and light, into sounds that are overlapping with danger and charm. The whole \u201cevil friends\u201d thing was just a happy writing accident, by the way, a lyrical coincidence belying a collaborative friendship Burton says taught him, too: \u201cI felt like I was watching them do something special and I wanted to let them do it, so sometimes I was more hands-on, but sometimes more hands-off than I had been with anyone,\u201d says Danger Mouse. \u201cThey had done enough albums that I thought it would be fun to shake it up a little bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, I asked Brian why he had wanted to talk about making a record,\u201d recalls Gourley. \u201cAnd he admitted that he was surprised when he saw us live. \u2018I didn\u2019t know you guys could sound like that.\u2019 There had been this perception that we\u2019ve been something else \u2014 and I\u2019ve noticed it, at festivals, everywhere \u2014 that we were something we were not. But then we got in a room with Danger Mouse, to the place where we could just throw that out, wake up and say, Here we are. We\u2019re this band! Let\u2019s just make it, together.\u201d\n","booking_agent":"N.

{"about":"In the studio recording a new record!!","band_members":"Stacy Jones, Jamie Arentzen, Drew Parsons, Brian Nolan","bio":"American Hi-Fi has been called a pop band, a pop-punk band, a pop metal band, but it's all just Rock n' Roll to me. After making three records, I have learned to embrace our continual identity crisis. I got into music at an early age. My parents always had music on around the house and in the car. My dad would sing along (in his own special key) to great records -- The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, the Beatles, ELO, the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones -- you get the picture. I would set-up pots and pans and sit in front of the stereo with giant headphones on, banging away with wooden spoons to songs like \"Tusk\" and \"Evil Woman.\" My parents bought me a drum set some years later, and my future was sealed.\nI played in every garage band I could find throughout junior high and high school. Every teen dance, every backyard party, every basement, every battle of the bands I used my parent's car to haul around my giant drum set (Neil Peart from Rush had set the bar pretty high). After high school, I moved to Boston for college.\n\nAt the time, all of my favorite bands seemed to be from Boston: The Pixies, The Lemonheads, Buffalo Tom, and Juliana Hatfield. I was lucky to be surrounded by such killer music. I ended up playing drums for some artists who I really respected; Tanya Donnely, Aimee Mann, until I met up with what would become my first \"real\" band, Letters to Cleo.\n\nI played drums in Cleo for several years; we had a pretty good run. We toured the world and played with a lot of my musical idols. I will always remember the first show we sold-out. We were playing with an up and coming band called Weezer in Hartford, Connecticut. The club was packed and the crowd so rowdy, that during Weezer's set, kids from the audience were climbing up the balcony to get to us. One of them reached me and almost pulled me over. The only thing that saved me from a three-story fall was Matt from Weezer, grabbing me on his way to the dressing room. I survived Hartford and went on to record two records with Letters to Cleo.\n\nI met my next band while playing shows together over the next year. They were called Veruca Salt. During a long break with Letters To Cleo, Nina Gordon asked me to join and I jumped at the chance. Our first tour in support of their second album was opening for Bush. It was during this time that I first had the idea to start my own band. I didn't really know how to play guitar, and had never sung a note in my life (not even in the shower). I bought a Mel Bays guitar book and taught myself how to play in the back of the tour bus.\n\nOn breaks from touring, I would hook up with my buddies in Boston and work on what would become American Hi-Fi. I recruited my best friends to be in the band - I knew Drew Parsons, our bass player, from Tracy Bonham's band. Brian Nolan, our former drummer, was just finishing a stint with the band Fig Dish from Chicago and Jamie Arentzen came from a much loved indie band, the Sky Heroes. It started out as late night jams in the old Cleo rehearsal space. Consisting of Cheap Trick covers and large quantities of beer, I never imagined that we would turn this thing into something real.\n\nEventually, I left Boston and headed to Maui to record Nina Gordon's solo record with Bob Rock. While I was there, I told Bob about my band. Every once in a while I would slip him demos and he got pretty interested in working with us. He told me to invite the guys in my band to Maui; we could rehearse in his warehouse and use all of his gear. The dudes came to Hawaii and we started writing the record. We would surf all morning and then hit the warehouse in the afternoon. We had yet to play a live show at this point, and we made our debut opening for Bob's country band at a local bar in up-country Maui called Casanova's. Drunken surfers and locals only, it was enough to convince Bob to do our record. We stayed in Maui for the next seven months and made the eponomously titled American Hi-Fi. \"Flavor of the Weak\" giving us our first radio hit.\n\nOur second album, The Art of Losing, produced by Nick Launay, showcased the more aggressive side of the band. Drawing from bands like The Jam and the Clash, Oasis and Cheap Trick, the record has a seventies punk aesthetic with a modern melodic approach. We always wear our influences very proudly on our sleeve (hints of Adam Ant are reflected in the title track).\n\nTwo albums in and a world of touring behind us (Eve 6, Our Lady Peace, Sum 41, Everclear, Elvis Costello, Phantom Planet) our label, Island Records, decided that the future of music was with 'emo' bands. They let us go just as we were hitting the road with Matchbox 20. With very little promotion on our second album, we marched on. The Matchbox tour was amazing and we sold-out our entire U.K. and Japanese tours before we even arrived.\n\nNext step? I moved to Los Angeles and took in the palm trees and Sunset Strip. A few months later the rest of the guys joined me. We took over a studio in Korea Town that had once belonged to Eric Erlandson from Hole. We were determined to continue American Hi-Fi with or without a label. After all, we were just getting started. We wrote and recorded the record ourselves, bringing in our friend Butch Walker (Avril Lavigne, Simple Plan, The Donnas) to help with the production. Butch and I had been friends for a while, and it seemed like a no brainer, we both grew up listening to the same music and had the same vision for the new Hi-Fi record.\n\nI think Blur might be the single biggest influence on the new record. I have always been a brit-pop freak, and I admire the way they always re-invent themselves album to album. So many bands influence us; I like the opportunity to experiment with different sounds and styles on every record. I think that makes for a better record and catalog. Who wants to put out the same record every time? The Beatles and the Stones, Joe Jackson and Elvis Costello never did! Not that I am comparing us to them, but they are our heroes.\n\nHearts On Parade is the new album, and I think it is our best yet. We cover some familiar ground with songs like \"The Geeks Get The Girls\" and \"Something Real,\" and branch out on tracks like \"We Can't Be Friends\" and \"Hell Yeah!\" Lyrically I've always worn my heart on my sleeve. Struggles, heartache, dark times, parties, its all there. I wrote \"Hell Yeah!\" after a perfect Hollywood night on the town. Moving to LA for the scenery, the girls and the nightlife, we left our troubles behind\u2026but I guess when you hear \"Something Real\" you realize, we never really left anything behind. On the surface, you move to a place like Hollywood and everyone looks happy, driving around in their shiny BMW's, but really, there's a darker side to it; the struggles that we all face searching for the real meaning of why we're here.\n\nDeep down, I've always felt like a bit of a geek when it comes to girls\u2026I guess that's what I wanted to get across in \"The Geeks Get The Girls\", an anthem of sorts for all of us guys who wish we were as smooth as we'd like to be and how cool it is when the 'underdog' finally gets the girl.\n\nThe entire feel of the album comes from change - both as a band and within each of us individually. Moving across the country, getting a fresh start, it all started the transition process for us. Musically, we have grown together as well; three albums in and we are really hitting our stride as a band.\n\nIt takes time to figure out who you are, and I feel like we are on our way...\n\nRock 'n' roll rules!\n\n-Stacy Jones (written on the road again, November 2004)","booking_agent":"Andy Somers of The Agency Group","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Twitter: \u0040AmericanHiFi","general_manager":"Bobby Collin of Morey Management Group","genre":"Alternative","hometown":"Boston, MA","influences":"cheap trick. the pixies. teenage fanclub. blur. the posies. joe jackson. the jam. foo fighters. oasis. motley crue. squeeze. xtc. my bloody valentine. superdrag. the lemonheads. nirvana. buffalo tom. the clash.","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":137,"username":"americanhifi","website":"www.americanhi-fi.com ","were_here_count":0,"id":"205097873721","name":"American Hi-Fi","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/americanhifi","likes":56717,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151609470453722","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/73530_10151609470453722_93873838_n.jpg","offset_y":34,"offset_x":0}}

Critics have called them one of the most important alternative rock bands to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s, and the group has had major influence on subsequent artists. Morrissey's lovelorn tales of alienation found an audience amongst youth culture bored by the ubiquitous synthesizer-pop bands of the early 1980s, while Marr's complex melodies helped return guitar-based music to popularity.\n\n(From http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Smiths)","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Alternative Rock","hometown":"Manchester, England","is_published":true,"record_label":"Rough Trade Records\/Warner Bros.\/Rhino UK","talking_about_count":12607,"username":"TheSmithsOfficial","were_here_count":0,"id":"30975687682","name":"The Smiths","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheSmithsOfficial","likes":3574098,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150610667607683","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/423136_10150610667607683_1085661645_n.jpg","offset_y":14,"offset_x":0}}

Watching the mass celebration of this song is powerful enough but the fact that the track had only been released days before the band hit the stage at the Rock Am Ring festival in Germany is testament to the loyalty of the band's fans around the world.\n\nDead Silence is the follow up to Billy Talent I, II and III and was recorded in three different studios in Toronto, Vancouver and Los Angeles. The album was produced by Billy Talent guitarist Ian D'Sa and is perfect proof for Billy Talent's inner strength, their focus and hard work ethic; character traits that have turned them into one of the most successful international rock acts of the past decade. Being together for almost 20 years and having travelled thousands of miles in vans, buses and planes turned the four piece not just into a band, but into a family \u2014 a tight brotherhood that will challenge and tackle any obstacle in front of them. Equipped with countless awards (such as multiple MuchMusic Awards, Juno Awards, MTV Awards and even two of those rare German Echo Awards) and having played the biggest festival stages worldwide, Billy Talent are ready to take on their next mission: to complete their world domination.\n\nFull bio at: http:\/\/www.billytalent.com\/about\/","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Toronto, ON","description":"WE SUPPORT:\n\nMS Society: http:\/\/mssociety.ca\/en\/\nSkate4Cancer: http:\/\/www.skate4cancer.com\/\nMake Music Matter:  http:\/\/www.makemusicmatter.org\/\nKids Help Phone:  http:\/\/org.kidshelpphone.ca\/en\nMake Poverty History: http:\/\/www.makepovertyhistory.ca\/\nMusicCounts:  http:\/\/www.musicounts.ca\/\n","general_manager":"Gary Gersh \u0040 The Artists Organization","genre":"Punk\/Rock","hometown":"Toronto, ON","is_published":true,"record_label":"Warner","talking_about_count":19646,"username":"billytalent","website":"http:\/\/www.billytalent.com\/ http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/billytalent http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/billytalentband","were_here_count":0,"id":"49102666991","name":"Billy Talent","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/billytalent","likes":1363497,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152154658526992","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/563852_10152154658526992_28953763_n.jpg","offset_y":60,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"'Like' OK Go to download a free exclusive live recording on our 'Music + Videos' tab. http:\/\/on.fb.me\/RBFIXz","band_members":"Damian Kulash\nTim Nordwind\nDan Konopka\nAndy \"Rusty\" Ross","bio":"OK GO: OF THE BLUE COLOUR OF THE SKY\nbio by Ira Glass\n\nOkay, let\u2019s just get this part out of the way. Most people know OK Go from their videos, especially those treadmills. Any video that\u2019s well enough known to be parodied on The Simpsons is a cultural force in itself and, checking the YouTube rating right before sitting down to write this, I was amazed to see that the number of views on the band\u2019s YouTube page alone now stands at 47,788,229. That\u2019s a lot. That many people and a brother who\u2019s the Governor of Florida is pretty much enough to win you a presidential election. Add the zillions who\u2019ve seen it elsewhere, and you might not even need the brother.\n\nSo if you\u2019re reading these words, you\u2019ve probably seen that video. I find even more endearing the video dance to \u201cA Million Ways\u201d that hundreds of amateur foursomes \u2013 kids and adults and church groups and school groups \u2013 have imitated in what certainly must be the world\u2019s first international YouTube dance contest. If you haven\u2019t had the pleasure, Google it right now and prepare to lose two hours of your life.\n\nBut I am here to say that OK Go is more than those videos. The band\u2019s frontman Damian Kulash sometimes makes big declarations like \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be a DIY band in a post-major label world\u201d or \u201cOur whole bag is having good ideas and making cool shit.\u201d\n\nI find that convincing.\n\nSome of the other cool shit they\u2019ve made lately: a record accompanied only by trombones, a play, an essay in the best-selling collection Things I\u2019ve Learned From Women Who Dumped Me, op-eds in the New York Times and Huffington Post. They\u2019ve testified before Congress and played in the Senate chambers. I repeat: they played music in the chambers of the United States Senate. They\u2019ve been commentators on All Things Considered. They interviewed a member of N\u2019Sync in the bathroom of Radio City Music Hall. They have a project where they walk the streets with fans handing out burritos to the homeless. They raised most of the money to buy a house for soul legend Al Johnson, so he could move home to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.\n\nAll these extracurriculars make a great story, and this is the story that gets the space in The Wall Street Journal and USA Today: OK Go is the polymath band who \u2013 with only five bucks and a camcorder \u2013 did what none of the giant record labels could, inventing a new way for a band to connect with fans and changing the way people think about music and the Internet. Great story, though it overlooks the most important thing about the band: its music. What makes OK Go great is that they write and perform great songs.\n\nWith this new record they seem determined not to let us forget it. Of the Blue Colour of the Sky is adventurously, emphatically musical \u2013 intricate, emotional, completely self-assured while it stakes out new musical territory. The ear-worm catchiness of their earlier records is still there, but the writing is more focused and sure-footed and the guitar sound broader and more dimensional.\n\nThe album\u2019s named after an 1876 book about the healing power of blue light (is it necessary to point out here that blue light has no such power?) and the lyrics are mostly about brave attempts at hope in the face of hopeless situations, which makes it fantastically upbeat and also very sad. The album\u2019s last line sums it up: \u201cEvery day is the same, we\u2019re praying for rain.\u201d\n\nThat said, it\u2019s mostly a dance record. Way more Prince than Leonard Cohen. Apparently some really sad stuff is happening in the guys\u2019 personal lives \u2013 perhaps fueled by their ridiculous 31-month stint on the road, away from loved ones \u2013 and the way they\u2019re expressing it is with infectious melodies, a sense of rhythm I can only describe as much feelier than before, and lyrics that seem either cheerful or trying-desperately-to-be-cheerful, depending on your frame of mind. The rule of thumb in pop music that great records come after heartbreak seems to be at work here in spades, and while that only makes me worried for the marriage of lyricist Damian Kulush (who sings mournfully in the barest moment on the album, \u201cCan\u2019t you love me?\u201d), even the upbeat songs are about love collapsing. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get my head around what the fuck is happening?\u201d goes one of the catchiest hooks. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make some sense out of what you\u2019re doing with my head.\u201d\n\nI listened obsessively for a couple weeks, and my favorite song \u2013 the one that would stick in my brain \u2013 kept shifting, which says good things. Right now it\u2019s \u201cBack From Kathmandu.\u201d I love how forcefully and confidently and slowly it goes about its business, with a yearning pop melody, scraggly loose guitars over a loud slow beat and that \u201cis it cheerful or is it sad?\u201d thing in spades. Dreamy verses lead to noisy, boisterous choruses about the power of love. What else could you want from a pop song?\n\nThis is supposed to be a bio, so here are some of the abc\u2019s of OK Go: Damian Kulash (vocals, guitar) and Tim Nordwind (bass) met at summer camp when they were eleven and promptly formed a band called The Greased Ferrets that featured folding chairs played as drums. They claim not to remember any of the songs they wrote at the time. \u201cClaim\u201d would be the key word in that sentence. They met Dan Konopka (drums) in college, but somehow didn\u2019t form into OK Go until 1999, even though they all believed someday they\u2019d have a band together. Figure. Andy Ross (guitar, keys) joined in 2005 after he met them through college pals.\n\nA few years ago, OK Go performed at some live shows our radio program This American Life was doing onstage across the country. They were like human catnip. We had huge crowds and people of every age\u2014high school sophomores to senior citizens\u2014just LOVED them. The band simply overwhelmed the audience with this exuberant buzz of fun and happiness and youth and rock \u2018n roll. They were sexy in a way that had a kind of well-scrubbed pop innocence to it, but that also moved a friend to murmur backstage, \u201cI want to fuck all four of them.\u201d\n\nJudging from the crowds at their shows these days, the reaction hasn\u2019t changed much. They\u2019ve been doing their thing \u2013 making cool shit \u2013 and thanks to the videos, that exuberant buzz has spilled across the globe. But don\u2019t let that distract you, the best part of OK Go is still the music.\n","booking_agent":"High Road Touring - info\u0040highroadtouring.com","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"info\u0040okgo.net","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Bobbie Gale - bobbie\u0040bbgunpress.com ","record_label":"Paracadute","talking_about_count":12098,"username":"okgo","website":"http:\/\/www.okgo.net http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/okgo http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/okgo http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/okgo https:\/\/www.soundcloud.com\/okgo","were_here_count":0,"id":"7112765682","name":"OK Go","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/okgo","likes":566462,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150621491670683","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/554839_10150621491670683_2071611240_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

The trio, made up of Ritzy Bryan (lead vocals, guitars), Rhydian Dafydd (bass, backing vocals) and Matt Thomas (drums, percussion) released their debut album \u2018The Big Roar\u2019 after signing worldwide with Canvasback Music, a division of Atlantic Records, and saw their live show expand dramatically, having made good on the promise that had seen them widely talked about as one of the bands poised to break through to bigger stages and greater acclaim at the start of the year. \n\nThe band have taken the opportunity offered with the release of their new album, \u2018Wolf\u2019s Law\u2019 to further widen their horizons and their sound will come as no surprise to anyone already familiar with their work to date or their live show. The blueprint for their worldview had been laid out on that debut album and the live shows which accompanied it around the globe. As venue sizes increased, the band\u2019s sound developed in tandem, songs were deconstructed and reconstructed with thrilling self-assurance, peaking in a month long tour with Foo Fighters and a run of high profile festival appearances at the likes of Glastonbury and Reading and Leeds alongside a headline slot at New York\u2019s prestigious Terminal 5 that had The New York Times cheering on \u2018an artful dissonance of style, \u2026a gleeful riot\u2019. On the \u2018home\u2019 side of the pond, a sold out London Forum was treated to the band\u2019s biggest UK headline show to date which left many agreeing with an earlier NME review which noted that \u2018The Joy Formidable have always sounded so much bigger than the stages they inhabit\u2019. \n\n\u2018Wolf\u2019s Law\u2019 is an unashamedly intricate record. Lyrically, the record touches politics of both the personal and global type, \u2018The Leopard And The Lung\u2019 focusing on Kenyan environmental activist (Wangari Maathai) while \u2018Tendons\u2019 is, according to Ritzy, \u2018the closest we have ever got to a love song, albeit a very peculiar, fucking love song\u2019. Throughout \u2018Wolf\u2019s Law\u2019 the experience of its diverse recording locations and its influence on the thought process of its writers is tangible. With initial recording taking place in the band\u2019s home of North Wales followed by recording the bulk of the album in a cabin in Portland, Maine in midwinter with snowstorms and drifts of up to 9 foot blocking any contact with the outside world, the extremes of the natural world were bound to play a part. The recording sessions were an enclosure described by Ritzy as like \u2018being in our recording bubble with no concept of time or day and night. It gave us the solitude to concentrate fully on the album that wouldn\u2019t have been possible elsewhere\u2019. So it should come as no surprise that the plight of the natural world in an age of rampant consumerism and consumption should make itself felt. \n\nGiven that we are talking about The Joy Formidable, this isn\u2019t a sloganeering album of sound bite politics but anyone who has seen the specially commissioned short film for the album\u2019s title track (which, in an interesting twist isn\u2019t actually on the album) will have noted that this isn\u2019t a band devoid of opinion. For Rhydian, the very existence of their music and lyrics is the way to engage with these issues: \n\n\u2018 How do you voice your frustration with an ever growing material world , with so much focus on celebrity culture , the trend of simplifying and celebrating one dimensionality because it's more marketable. For us, it's to demonstrate through our album, our art, that there are also other ways, other things that are important and be true to our vision\u2019.\n\nWith further recording sessions in London and mixing in New York with renowned mixer Andy Wallace (Jeff Buckley, Rage Against The Machine, Nirvana) the flip side to the rural isolation of recording was the atmosphere of two of the world\u2019s most built up commercial cities. Throughout the album the band engage lyrically with their sense that we live in a world where greed and materialism are becoming pervasive but no more so than in \u2018Maw Maw Song\u2019, a thundering piece of electronic tinged rock that replicates sonically the sense of over consumption that seems to epitomise elements of the modern world. These lyrical concerns tie into the artwork for the album, commissioned from artist Martin Wittfooth, a Canadian whose recurrent themes are the pressures of human progress on the natural world and the loss of environment in the name of progress. \n\nThe band\u2019s reconnection with the natural world was strengthened by an increasing interest in Native American mythology and practice, an area which encompassed the art of Carl Ray and the creature legends that populate American Indian stories. Thus the album title \u2018Wolf\u2019s Law\u2019 is both a reference to the wolf which populates Native American mythology and the medical theory that states stress on a certain body part changes and strengthens that part to cope with the stress. As a one shot of the thinking behind the record it couldn\u2019t be closer, both adapting to new realities and finding a spiritual mindset have been part of this record. This can be a dangerous path for the modern band, to attempt serious discourse within the confines of (in its widest sense) pop music. To their credit, the band both recognise this and dismiss it. For them, the purpose of The Joy Formidable is to both instigate thought and move heads, considerations of \u2018cool\u2019 for cool\u2019s sake\u2019 are far from their minds), Rhydian again: \n\n\u2018To me, being cool is not about pretending, not worrying about fitting in. As a band we are not going to change ourselves for anyone. All our favourite artists are and were unique , they led the pack, they didn't try to follow. Music is a discourse, and we want to challenge people to get involved and invest, to react and feel. We want to be a catalyst.\u2019 \n\nGiven that the story of The Joy Formidable to date has been written as much on the road as off it, it is little surprise that the trio see their music as unbounded by geography. Note the internationalism of the influences on the album and the cast involved in its creation and you can see a band that are defined by their art and open to inspiration regardless of its locale. It is fitting, then, that the first steps of \u2018Wolf\u2019s Law\u2019 will be taken in festival fields across the globe, with the band paying their first visit to the UK in August of 2012 at The Reading and Leeds Festival, no doubt to be that catalyst for the first of many UK audiences over the coming year.

{"about":"Lit's Official Facebook Profile! ","band_members":"A.Jay Popoff - Vocals\nJeremy Popoff - Guitar\nKevin Baldes - Bass\nNathan Walker - Drums\n","bio":"Lit\nThe View From The Bottom\nBiography\n\nLit are about to release their fifth studio album, The View From The Bottom on Megaforce Records, so it\u2019s natural to ask yourself, \u201cWhere has the band been?\u201d But the answer to that question is particularly complicated, rife with stories and situations of triumph over tribulation. The answer is all in the new record\u2019s title. \n\nNo, it has nothing to do with Lit having slid off the face of the earth (and the charts) over the past eight or so years. In fact, through a number of heartbreaking challenges, the Fullerton, CA rock band, comprised of bros, singer A. Jay Popoff, guitarist\/singer Jeremy Popoff, and lifelong friends, bassist\/singer Kevin Baldes and drummer Allen Shellenberger, would remain active. Even vital. \n\nAs if it needs to be said, the group, had seen significant success with their second album A Place in the Sun (1999) which spawned 3 uber hit singles: \u201cMiserable,\u201d which went to #3 on the Modern Rock Tracks, and whose video featured the flaxen voluptitude of Pamela Anderson; \u201cZip-Lock,\u201d and \u201cMy Own Worst Enemy\u201d (which held the number one position on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for three months, and received a Billboard Music Award for the biggest modern rock song of 1999). The song has actually sold over 650,000 downloads to date, which is no small feat considering that it was released before the advent of that technology.  \n\nMost of Lit\u2019s salad days were spent on the road. They rocked Woodstock 1999 and supported the Offspring, No Doubt and Garbage, spanning the globe and clocking in close to 500 shows between 1999 and 2000 (They were also seen all over television on MTV Spring Break, Cribs, TRL, Leno, Conan and more). And riding on its heels, A Place In The Sun\u2019s 2001 follow-up Atomic boasted yet another Top Ten single for the band, \u201cLipstick And Bruises,\u201d and a support tour with Kid Rock. \n\nAfter a very short breather, Lit would again, hit the road in 2003, this time, with a more intimate club tour to support the release of their fourth, self-titled LP, released in 2004, post a bold move to an indie label. A long-form live performance DVD release, All Access would follow later that year, and concurrently, Jeremy would give the band's hometown of Fullerton, CA a new watering hole, the Slidebar, which fast became a top Orange County hang. \n\nThen, in a tragic turnabout of fortune, A. Jay and Jeremy\u2019s stepfather was killed and their mother seriously injured when they were involved in a motorcycle accident with a drunk driver on the Ortega Highway near their home in Lake Elsinore. The tragedy would make it extremely difficult for the band to weather the work but despite it all, they would continue to write and play shows. In July of 2008, the band had been called to support Kiss on a European tour but just days before the first date, misfortune befell the group again when Shellenberger was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Just over a year later, the illness would take his life.  \n\nSpirits left in ruins, still A. Jay, Jeremy and Kevin found the wherewithal to make the music. Initially, the group still felt unable to pen songs for a new disc. Slowly, without forcing it, the group began writing. \u201cIt took those traumatic things to slowly start pulling us back together as a unit,\u201d says A. Jay. \n\nWith the help of a new drummer\/old friend, in fact Shellenberger\u2019s drum tech, Nathan Walker and guitarist\/keyboardist Ryan Gillmor, Lit suddenly found themselves with a pile of new material. The inspiration had struck and during various writing sessions throughout 2010 and 2011 The group began to construct their first new tracks in many years. \u201cWe\u2019re ready as a band to get out there again,\u201d A. Jay says. \u201cWe have the right guys now and our band is more focused than it\u2019s ever been, maybe because we\u2019ve learned so much in the process.\u201d\n\nThe group headed into the studio in late 2011 with Butch Walker, who had recently helmed records by Panic! At The Disco, Avril Lavigne and Weezer, (along writing credits on countless hits), armed with a selection of these new songs and, for the first time ever, demos. Whereas in the past Lit had written just enough tracks for an album, on this album the band was prepared with way more tracks than appear on The View From The Bottom. The majority of the disc was tracked live on two-inch tape in order to capture a \u201cvery organic and real\u201d feeling in the recordings. The process felt natural, like the time to make a follow-up to Lit was finally the right time. \n\n\u201cWe were thrilled and excited to be able to finally make a record with Butch,\u201d Jeremy says of the recording process. \u201cIt was such a blast. It was a very fast, organic process- completely drama free. It was all about fun and making the best music we could make. Just really enjoying the process, which we now have the luxury of doing. It was just the way it should be making a record.\u201d\n\nThe resulting album is impassioned and alive, a collection of solidly catchy rock songs that reverberate with inspiration. \n\nMixed by Joe Zook (Katy Perry, The Hives, One Republic, Pink) The View From The Bottom tangibly tells the story of Lit\u2019s in between days. The tracks, which veer from upbeat rocker to pensive ballad, narrate the story of the musicians\u2019 experiences over the past ten years, encompassing both their individual and collective histories. Allen\u2019s death is threaded throughout the album, coloring the songwriting on tracks like \u201cThe Wall,\u201d a number based around a photograph of the band taken at his last show. \u201cThe picture\u2019s in my living room,\u201d Jeremy notes. \u201cWe took the picture off the wall and took it into the yard when we were writing and the lyric is \u2018There\u2019s more behind that picture than the wall.\u2019 It represents an important growth as songwriters. I\u2019m really proud of that one.\u201d\n\nOther standout tracks include, \u201cThe Broken\u201d and most poignantly, \u201cHere\u2019s To Us,\u201d but the new record is not without its lighter, Big Rock Moments- reference the absolutely monolithic kick-starter, \u201cC\u2019mon\u201d and the equally tremendous \u201cYou Tonight,\u201d co-written by Marti Frederiksen whose collabs include Aerosmith, Ozzy Osbourne, Mick Jagger, and Carrie Underwood among others, not to mention the glam stomper, \u201cSame Shit, Different Drink,\u201d (co-written with Walker).  \n\nUltimately, The View From the Bottom is inherently a Lit album, driven by propulsive tracks intended to make the listener let go and have a good time. It reflects two sides of the same spectrum, offering a balanced, diverse listening experience that finds cohesiveness in both its tone and songwriting prowess. \n\n\u201cPart of us wanted to touch on the stuff that we\u2019d been through and there was another part of us that just wanted to get back to the idea of having fun and being excited to play live,\u201d Jeremy says of that dichotomy. \u201cI think there was also an element of wanting to make music we felt like was missing from the radio right now. Which is exactly how we felt 12 years ago when we were writing A Place In the Sun.\u201d\n\nNow, as the band heads back on the road, Lit is prepared to both re-excite their longtime fans and win over new ones. With a recent record label deal with Megaforce, a company that Lit felt connected to in terms of their goals and musical philosophies, the band hopes listeners will see the past ten years as a success story. In the end, the band is just a group of guys who saw some triumphs and along with those achievements came some tragedies. But they stuck together and have come out on the other side swinging, new music in hand. \n\nLook for a headlining tour of the southeast in April and May and, the band will join the Summerland Tour (along with Sugar Ray, The Gin Blossoms, Everclear and Marcy Playground) in late June through August. \n\nAnd for more information about Lit, please visit: http:\/\/www.litband.com","booking_agent":"Paradise Artists, agent Charlie Davis, 805-646-8433, Charlie\u0040paradiseartists.com","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Career Artist Management","genre":"Rock","hometown":"Fullerton, CA.","is_published":true,"record_label":"Megaforce","talking_about_count":665,"username":"LitLounge","website":"www.litband.com www.myspace.com\/litlounge www.youtube.com\/LitTV","were_here_count":0,"id":"34777348944","name":"Lit","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LitLounge","likes":76722,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151744581313945","source":"http:\/\/sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash2\/s720x720\/382516_10151744581313945_179963588_n.jpg","offset_y":66,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"We All Raise Our Voices to the Air, our first-ever live record, is available NOW: http:\/\/thedecemberists.com","band_members":"Colin Meloy\nChris Funk\nJenny Conlee\nNate Query\nJohn Moen ","bio":"Life as a musician means continual evolution. Over the course of a career, any band worth paying attention to will pursue a sound, a direction, until it triggers a different idea and they\u2019re chasing some other distant dream. With their sixth album, The King Is Dead, The Decemberists illustrate the power that comes from this kind of creative call-and-response.\n\nWhen the band completed their wildly ambitious 2009 song cycle The Hazards of Love, frontman and primary songwriter Colin Meloy said that \u201cdoing this album took a lot out of me, and I\u2019m definitely curious what will come out now that I\u2019ve gotten it out of my system.\u201d \n\nThe Hazards of Love, a narrative suite that grew out of old English folk tunes, met with widespread acclaim (Mojo wrote that \u201cthis spellbinding work peaks and soars with all the warmth and wonder of some great romantic adventure,\u201d while Rolling Stone gave the album four stars), and was followed by a grand-scale tour in which The Decemberists performed the project in full. But by that time, Meloy was already feeling the pull of another approach.\n\n\u201cHazards was actually a bit self-destructive,\u201d he says. \u201cWe knew people might have a hard time getting into it. On tour, we would play the whole thing\u2014but once we were onstage at Bonnaroo or wherever, I just kind of wanted to play some normal songs!\u201d\n\nInspired by a move to a more rural area outside the band\u2019s base of Portland, Oregon, Meloy took a few songs that had been left off of Hazards and started working on the kind of project he had long been thinking about\u2014a set of more stripped-down, country-based songs. The mostly-acoustic arrangements on The King Is Dead showcase the ways in which The Decemberists\u2014Meloy, Chris Funk, Jenny Conlee, Nate Query, and John Moen\u2014sound just as glorious in simple, concise compositions as they do on the elaborate structures that have defined their work for years. \n\nAs far back as 2004, the band released \u201cThe Tain,\u201d an eighteen-and-a-half minute single based on an Irish myth. The Crane Wife (which NPR listeners voted their favorite album of 2006) took as its starting point an ancient Japanese folk tale, which was interpreted across three separate songs, and climaxed with \u201cThe Island,\u201d a 13-minute, three-section murder ballad.\n\nMeloy points out, however, that creating straightforward, unadorned songs can be at least as hard as building complicated musical epics. \u201cFor all my talk about how complex those records were, this one may have been harder to do,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a real challenge to make simple music, and lot of times we had to deliberately hold off and keep more space. This record is an exercise in restraint.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that songs like \u201cAll Arise!\u201d and \u201cRise to Me,\u201d complete with Funk\u2019s plaintive pedal-steel guitar, echo the homespun sound of albums like Neil Young\u2019s Harvest. Meloy describes that classic as \u201cthe quintessential barn record,\u201d and it was the concept of the barn\u2014as recording space and as attitude\u2014that informed the making of The King Is Dead. The album was recorded in a converted barn at Pendarvis Farm\u2014home of the annual Pickathon indie roots music festival\u2014an 80-acre estate of lush meadows, forest, and Mt. Hood views outside of Portland. \u201cWe wanted that ethos,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the color we wanted the record to have.\u201d\n\nThe country-rock sound of the 1970s was also behind the decision to bring in Americana luminary Gillian Welch, who sings on seven of the album\u2019s ten songs. \u201cSome of my favorite country-rock records had that consistent pairing with a female voice, like Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris or Neil and Nicolette Larson on Comes a Time,\u201d says Meloy. \u201cWe thought it'd be great if there was a female foil to my singing and Gillian was sweet enough to come on board.\u201d\n\nFor some of the album\u2019s other songs, The Decemberists were able to reel in one of their actual inspirations into the recording studio. \u201cA few things, like \u2018Down by the Water\u2019 and \u2018Calamity Song,\u2019 were out-and-out homages to R.E.M.,\u201d says Meloy. \u201cRobyn HItchcock was opening some of our shows, and Peter Buck plays in his group. I mentioned to him that I was writing some songs that were really ripping off his style, and he thought it was funny, so it seemed like, why not get him in and just wear it on our sleeves?\u201d Buck wound up adding his signature propulsive, chiming guitar on those two songs, and contributing a mandolin part to the opener \u201cDon\u2019t Carry It All.\u201d\n\nAnother of the album\u2019s guest contributors is violinist Annalisa Tornfelt, a collaborator along with Funk, Conlee, and Query in the noir bluegrass band Black Prairie. Tornfelt\u2019s rousing fiddle adorns \u201cDon\u2019t Carry It All,\u201d \u201cAll Arise!,\u201d and \u201cRox In The Box.\u201d\n\nFor all of the album\u2019s shift in musical direction, though, The King Is Dead is still clearly a Decemberists album, especially in the usage of imagery taken from landscapes, plants, and water throughout the lyrics. \u201cThe syntax of The Decemberists is definitely still there,\u201d says Meloy. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be too much of a departure. But where the nature motifs were more mystical on The Hazards of Love, the flora of this record are more of a pastoral backdrop.\u201d\n\nTo Colin Meloy, in some ways The King is Dead represents his own musical journey coming full circle. \u201cOver the last eleven years or so, since I moved to Portland, I feel like I've been mining mostly English traditions for influence\u201d, he says. \u201cI guess I've kind of come back to a lot of the more American music that got me going in the first place \u2013 R.E.M. and Camper Van Beethoven and all these bands that borrowed from more American traditions like Neil Young and the Byrds.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I kind of miss the epic-ness of the other albums,\u201d he continues, \u201cbut it\u2019s nice to get all of the information across in three minutes. It\u2019s like going from reading a novel to reading a bunch of short stories.\u201d\n","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Jason Colton - thedecemberists\u0040redlightmanagement.com","hometown":"Portland","influences":"classic pop, folk, klezmer, Irish jig, sea chantey, prog rock, Pink Floyd, Yes, Fairport Convention, R.E.M., The Waterboys, U2","is_published":true,"record_label":"Capitol Records","talking_about_count":2013,"username":"thedecemberists","website":"http:\/\/www.decemberists.com http:\/\/twitter.com\/thedecemberists","were_here_count":0,"id":"5229624654","name":"The Decemberists","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thedecemberists","likes":569348,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150640259914655","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/423144_10150640259914655_1001312336_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Con Martin refinaron su sonido, en su madurez como compositores elaboraron letras a\u00fan m\u00e1s agudas y supieron unir el ingenio con las cosas m\u00e1s sencillas y valiosas de la vida.

{"about":"The Official Facebook Page of Creed.  Download our greatest hits album on itunes! http:\/\/smarturl.it\/4lfs1o and www.creed.com\/site.html","band_members":"Scott Stapp\nMark Tremonti\nScott Phillips\nBrian Marshall","bio":"It's not easy to find a success story as genuine as Creed's in popular culture these days when considering all of the carefully scripted rises to glory and the falls that inevitably follow careers built on hype. If any band in recent years can claim to have ascended strictly on its own merits, it's Creed. This Florida-based band went from zero to sixty, (or, more accurately, from zero to selling more than twenty million albums) by virtue of a combination of finger-on-the-pulse songs and powerful live performances. Their debut album, My Own Prison, has sold over six million albums to date. Creed's sophomore effort, Human Clay, debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts and has gone on to sell more than 10 Million copies. The band's third release, Weathered, also debuted at #1, selling more copies in its first week than any other rock release in 2001, and tying the record for the longest run at the top following a #1 debut.\n\n\"With My Own Prison, I knew we had the talent to get a record deal and I knew we had songs good enough to get played on the radio, but I never had any expectations of reaching this many people,\" says Creed's frontman Scott Stapp.\n\nNonetheless, the band's success has been truly phenomenal. Creed was the first band in history to have four #1 Rock Radio singles from a debut album. On the strength of their singles, including the crushing title track and the more pensive \"What's This Life For,\" Creed topped countless year-end charts and was recognized as the Rock Artist of the Year at Billboard's 1998 Music Awards. Their debut album was also the #1-selling Hard Music album of 1998 on SoundScan's Hard Music chart.\n\nWith the release of their second album, Human Clay, Creed upped the ante yet again. \"Higher,\" the first single from their 10-times platinum sophomore release, broke the Active and Mainstream Rock airplay records for the most consecutive weeks at #1, holding the coveted spot for eighteen weeks. Furthermore, Creed was recognized once again as the Rock Artist of the Year at Billboard's 1999 and 2000 Music Awards. Human Clay 's first three singles (\"Higher,\" \"What If\" and \"With Arms Wide Open\") again achieved #1 status, setting a record with a total of seven consecutive #1 Rock Radio singles.\n\n\"We're the type of band that functions really well under pressure and the only pressure that we recognize is our own. We definitely wanted to top ourselves [after the My Own Prison album],\" says Stapp. \"We wanted to make a really great record. The band's goal has always been to make records that are solid from start to finish; records that take you through an entire range of emotions.\" Guitarist \/ co-writer Mark Tremonti added, \"We always kept in mind that we had to write for ourselves because as long as we are proud of it, our fans will be as well. We try not to set any other goals above and beyond that.\" While Stapp grants that the band's increased resources had some impact on the structure of Human Clay, it's clear that Creed's evolution is far more than just a matter of dollars and cents.\n\nOnce again, Creed has returned with an album of songs that collectively offer the listener a passionate journey of emotive energy. Tremonti and Stapp's collaborations stand among the select few that seem to effortlessly draw the listener in and truly move the spirit through the simple art of expression. The lead single, \"My Sacrifice,\" opens with a signature Mark Tremonti guitar intro and then envelops the listener with the mood and power no other band today commands.\n\nFor Weathered, Creed once again turned to longtime friend and producer John Kurzweg to ensure that they captured the anthemic guitars, dramatic vocals and bold lyrics that have made the band's brawny-yet-intimate sound a radio staple for several years. The band also decided to invite Kirk Kelsey, their longtime live sound engineer, to co-produce the new material. Together with Kurzweg and Kelsey, Creed recorded the new album in a home studio just outside of Orlando. Drummer Scott Phillips commented, \"We've done our previous two albums in home studios and have felt that this is our best creative environment where we can feel comfortable and creative as a band.\" Guitarist Mark Tremonti performed all of the bass guitar tracks on Weathered and a few special guests made passionate contributions to the album. On \"Don't Stop Dancing,\" the band was joined by the Tallahassee Boys' Choir and Amie Stapp. Regarding his sister's appearance on the album, Stapp noted, \"I had been looking for a female vocalist for awhile and it dawned on me that I didn't need to look any farther than home.\" On \"Who's Got My Back?,\" vocalist Bo Taylor, an archivist at The Museum of the Cherokee Indian, makes a special appearance on the invitation of Creed. Taylor mentioned, \"I really like Creed's music because they are asking questions that all human beings should ask as they look outside of themselves. Music touches people and Scott contacted me to celebrate where he originally came from and to reconnect with his ancestry. It speaks volumes about his character that he reached back and made this statement and it means a lot to me personally that he did this.\"\n\n\"I think my lyrics are very direct and understandable,\" says Stapp. \"People can relate to that, so that's something I didn't want to move away from. At the same time, we're a little bit older and more mature now and we've been through a lot in the past few years, so we are looking to put things across in a way that reflected that.\" Co-writer Mark Tremonti added, \"We wanted to take our sound and expand on it. I think Weathered is the most diverse, dynamic record we have written to date.\"\n\nCreed's reputation for dynamic and passionate live performances has led to consistently sold-out shows. Over the past four years the band has played to more than four million fans worldwide. \"We were out on tour for a long time and wherever we went, there were people telling me how much certain songs meant to them and how they felt so close to them,\" says Stapp. \"That means more to me than any other kind of attention. It's important to feel as if you're doing something worthwhile and in this band, with Mark and Scott, I feel like I am.\" On a similar note, drummer Scott Phillips added, \"Our success has been dictated by the fans. They are the most important thing in the band's life. The three of us feel blessed to have such a great following of people. It's amazing to me when I sit behind the kit during a show and see the passion and emotion displayed by the audience.\"\n\nIn January 2002, Creed embarked on a world tour that will bring them to over one million fans throughout the year. The year began with a trek across North American arenas in January, after which they touched down in Australia and New Zealand in July. The band will then return to the U.S. for a Summer \/ Fall stadium tour. When asked before the tour about his feelings on getting back on the road and in front of the band's fans, guitarist Mark Tremonti replied, \"Personally, I can't wait to get back on tour. It is something I truly enjoy and can't live without. It has been too long since we played a full blown show.\" Scott Phillips mentioned, \"It's been over a year since we've had a chance to perform in front of a crowd. Our experiences in previous years have been amazing and we can't wait to continue that feeling.\"\n\nIn 2000, Creed's presence on television and their impact on end-of-year award shows were undeniable. The band released their VH1 Behind The Music special, taped and released VH1's Storytellers with The Doors and garnered numerous awards. In November, Creed earned two awards at the Radio Music Awards and the fans bestowed four awards on the band at the My VH1 Awards. They also received the award for Rock Artist of the Year, for the third year in a row, at the Billboard Awards in December. The writing team of Mark Tremonti \/ Scott Stapp kicked off 2001 by winning a Grammy Award for the band's composition, \"With Arms Wide Open,\" a deeply personal song that was inspired when Stapp learned he was going to become a father.\n\nStapp is also continually besieged with requests to help with a variety of fund-raisers and charities and helps whenever and wherever he can. He has started his own charity, the \"With Arms Wide Open Foundation\" in an attempt to help underprivileged children and to be able to give something back to the communities that have supported Creed.\n\nFor more information on Scott Stapp, visit https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ScottStapp\n","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Rock","hometown":"Florida","is_published":true,"record_label":"Wind-up Records","talking_about_count":11060,"username":"Creed","website":"http:\/\/www.creed.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"5638429994","name":"Creed","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Creed","likes":3477989,"cover":{"cover_id":474631084994,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc1\/s720x720\/577258_474631084994_995724146_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Follow \u0040TheBravery","band_members":"Sam Endicott - Vocals, Rhythm Guitar\nMichael Zakarin - Lead Guitar\nJohn Conway - Keyboards\nMike Hindert - Bass\nAnthony Burulcich - Drums","bio":"It began innocently enough. Sam played bass, John played keyboards. They met in art school, where they played any kind of music they could get there hands on--from punk to country to jazz to metal. In the early '00s they moved to NYC, where they discovered the Electroclash scene in full swing. They loved the sound of electronic music made in the basement on piece-of-shit equipment. It sounded new and different, and they wondered if they could take that sound \u2026 and add it to a live band, creating a fusion of rock and electronic music. Sam had an iMac, John had a keyboard, and they both had guitars. They figured, what else would we need?\n\nA band. So they looked for a singer, but couldn't find one. So Sam thought, well, why don't I try writing some songs, and I could sing them. Only problem was, he couldn't sing a note. But they didn't let that get in the way. He plugged in the guitar and wrote a song called \"Tyrant,\" about the girl who lived next door. It was a rock song, but John took it and remixed into a dance song. One night they played it at a house party. The girls danced. The girls demanded they play it over and over again. They realized they were on the right path.\n\nThey needed some other guys for the band, so they put an ad in the paper. Michael answered. He was a jazz-cat, a Django Reinhardt devotee; this was new music for him, and he loved it. They asked the other bands they knew about drummers. They said, well there's a guy who's amazing, but he just moved here from Boston last week so no one's got him yet. This was Anthony. They grabbed him; he didn't know any better.\n\nThey booked a show, opening for a friend's band at tiny Stinger Club in Brooklyn. The show was in a week and they needed a bass player. So Michael enlisted his best friend, also named Michael. Only problem was, new Michael had never played a bass before. But he practiced constantly for the week, pretty much without sleeping, and played the show. They rocked.\n\nThe group hung out in John's apartment in Chinatown, writing and recording songs. They went about it in a weird way; they made rock'n'roll the way DJs make electronic music. A DJ takes samples into the computer, chops 'em up, edits them, manipulates the sounds, until, voila: You have a song. This is what the Bravery did, except instead of using samples, they made all the sounds themselves. Sam would write the basic song on guitar, the group would record it like a rock track, and then remix it beyond recognition. Result: something new and bold.\n\nLyrically, Sam writes from a strange perpective--call it that of a \"hopeful misanthrope.\" You get the impression he hates every person he has ever met; and sometimes he is overcome with the frustration of this. But at the last minute he refuses to give up, and you leave the song with a sense of optimism, of innocent hope. You listen to him battling his fears, his sense of negativity, and winning out in the end. As a reflection of this, they named their band The Bravery.\n\nEventually, they had enough songs for a whole album, so the band made a website and put the album online. They also put it on another odd site they discovered, called Myspace. (Remember, this is 2003.) They burned CDs of their music and handed them out all around town. They would stand outside of Tower Records all day handing out burned CDs. They'd play anywhere they could get a gig; the basement of Lit, TT the Bears and Middle East in Boston, etc. They would hang out all day putting up fliers, or handing out CDs outside of other shows.\n\nSoon, the band saw that people had started coming to the shows. Then other people started playing their album. Zane Lowe at Radio One in the U.K. downloaded songs off the band's website and started playing them on the air. Soon, Aaron Axelsen at Live 105 in San Francisco and Paul Driscoll at WFNX in Boston did the same. They booked a residency at Arlene's Grocery in New York, every Thursday night for a month. Then a LOT of people started coming to the shows. Including record label people.\n\nIsland Records released The Bravery in 2005. For the next 18 months the band toured the world basically non-stop, enjoying much success and two international hit songs--\"An Honest Mistake\" and \"Unconditional.\" The time passed quickly.\n\n\n\nTHE SUN AND THE MOON\n\nAfter touring for all this time, The Bravery were better musicians, better singers, a better band. They wanted to make an album that would reflect their growth as musicians. So they recruited producer Brendan O'Brien, well known for bringing out the best performance in a group (see: Rage Against the Machine, Neil Young etc.). The band wanted to try new textures and sounds, so they moved to Brendan's Atlanta studio and grabbed any instrument they could get their hands on, and choked it until something good came out. That included antique pump organs (\"Believe\"), Mellotrons (\"Time Won't Let Me Go\"), a string quartet (\"The Ocean\"), and a host of Pet Sounds-worthy vocal arrangements (\"This is Not the End,\" \"Above and Below\").\n\nDespite this newfound creativity and sense of musical exploration, the band also wanted to keep the energy that came with recording in the basement in New York. To that end, the band split its time between Atlanta and NYC. The resulting album is a hybrid of the two experiments \u2013 with a fair amount recorded in the back of tour buses as well.\n\nThis time out, they explore the same subjects of overcoming fear and negativity, but to a far greater extent, getting into territory that could be described as spiritual. Life and death, good and evil, hope and desperation--the extremes. And so came the album's title: The Sun and the Moon.","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"New York, NY","is_published":true,"record_label":"Island Def Jam","talking_about_count":516,"username":"thebravery","website":"www.thebravery.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"6115148906","name":"The Bravery","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thebravery","likes":306076}

{"about":"http:\/\/www.theheadandtheheart.com","band_interests":"Songwriting and the effects thereof","band_members":"Jonathan Russell- Vocals\/Guitar\/Percussion\nJosiah Johnson- Vocals\/Guitar\/Percussion\/Keys\nCharity Rose Thielen- Vocals\/Violin\/Percussion\nKenny Hensley- Piano\nTyler Williams- Drums\/Percussion\nChris Zasche- Bass","bio":"So many decisions in life and in the music we love can come down to a critical tug between the logic in our heads and the hot red blood beating through our hearts. Seattle\u2019s The Head and the Heart live authentically in that crux, finding joy and beauty wedged there. Their music pulses effervescently\u2014both explosively danceable and intuitively intelligent. With Americana roots and strong vocal harmonics that swell like a river, this band finds its anchor in solid songwriting that has even the jaded humming along by the second listen.\n\nLeaving a variety of day jobs and academic pursuits, The Head and the Heart came together in the summer of 2009, during frequent visits to the open mic night at Conor Byrne in Seattle\u2019s Ballard neighborhood. California-transplant Josiah Johnson and Virginia-native Jonathan Russell formed the core songwriting partnership, quickly adding keyboardist Kenny Hensley to the mix. Kenny, then 21, had packed up his piano and moved up to Seattle from California to pursue musical score-writing. The luminous Charity Rose Thielen, violin and vocals, had just returned from a year of studying and playing music in Paris. Drummer Tyler Williams cold left a successful band in Virginia after Jon sent him the demo of \u201cDown in the Valley,\u201d relocating across states to be a part of this. Finally, Chris Zasche, was bartending at Conor Byrne and mentioned one day that he\u2019d be happy to play bass for the nascent band. It all felt right: The Head and the Heart was born.\n\nWhether penning songs on the beach at Seattle\u2019s Discovery Park, or working out melodies in the piano practice rooms at the Seattle Public Library, Charity describes the early months of the band\u2019s existence as touched by a shared purpose and connection. She recalls an email she sent to Josiah that summer, confessing that she was \u201csleepless and penniless, but inspired nonetheless.\u201d\n\nThe band entered Seattle\u2019s Studio Litho in early 2010 to record these songs that had been kicking and twisting in the catalytic development of their live show. Recorded by Shawn Simmons at Studio Litho and Steven Aguilar at Bearhead Studio, the band was selling burned copies in handmade denim sleeves at local shows within a few weeks. Self-released in June 2010, the debut album helped build an impressive head-of-steam for the band through the second half of the year, gaining fans at influential Seattle station KEXP, local record shops (a consistent top 10 seller for Easy Street and the #1 album of 2010 at Sonic Boom), and venues up and down the West Coast, culminating with signing to Sub Pop Records in November. For the 2011 re-release of the album, \u201cSounds like Hallelujah\u201d has been re-recorded, live favorite \u201cRivers and Roads\u201d has been added, and the album has been re-mastered.\n\nThe songs resulting from those first inspired months pick at the multicolored threads of leaving home, finding home, and through that process of deconstruction, finding yourself. These are songs about crossing rivers and roads to get to the one you love, about family far away, and the desire to chase Technicolor dreams down foreign horizons. When people hear these songs, or see the band live, the first thing they have to do is tell someone else. Their shows are, simply, one hell of a lot of breathless fun. Each song explodes into a potent supernova on stage, where half the audience is zealously singing along with every lyric, and the other half is wishing they knew the words. The band has accepted nearly every show offered to them in the past year, from backyards strung with Christmas lights to coffee shops, open mics, and even high school classrooms in Middle America. From the first months of the band\u2019s life, their reputation as a phenomenal live band has preceded them wherever they play.\n\nThe strength of Josiah, Jon and Charity\u2019s vocal harmonies on the album makes it feel like these three were born to pour their voices together, as the band\u2019s songs revel in jaunty bass lines with ebullient handclaps peppering the best moments. A palette of orchestral elements weave their way through the album, including cello, glockenspiel, and violin, all shading in the songs\u2019 development. For all the times your toes tap while enjoying this band, often the lightness will deceptively belie the depth of ache in the lyrics when you sit down to really listen. There is magic in the music, but not magic contrived by trickery or posturing. \u201cIt seems actually that the more genuine and honest we are in the songwriting and performing, the more people relate to that transparency,\u201d Charity muses.\n\nThis is an album for people who unabashedly sing and drum along on the steering wheel, and also for those who appreciate a well-crafted collection of songs that build into something wholly beautiful.\n\nThere is in this music a counter-cultural optimism, with roots that grow deep and melodies that lodge themselves far into that place inside you where the head meets the heart.\n\n\u2014Heather Browne","booking_agent":"US\/Canada- Ali Hedrick, Billions, ali\u0040billions.com International- Mike Greek, CAA, mgreek\u0040CAA.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Seattle, WA","general_manager":"Jordan Kurland, Zeitgeist Management, info\u0040zeitgeistmanagement.com","genre":"pop music","hometown":"Seattle, WA","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Kate Jackson, Grandstand, katej\u0040grandstandhq.com","record_label":"Sub Pop Records","talking_about_count":2515,"username":"theheadandtheheart","website":"http:\/\/www.theheadandtheheart.com\/  http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/headandtheheart","were_here_count":0,"id":"137022972693","name":"The Head and the Heart","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theheadandtheheart","likes":211296,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151670537487694","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash4\/s720x720\/1382122_10151670537487694_1464053652_n.jpg","offset_y":6,"offset_x":0}}

The band intentionally made their sound as small as possible, thumbing their collective musical noses at the very idea that in the USA something so incredibly wide-load and excessive could be perceived \"alternative.\" CAKE wondered, how could music that is the aural equivalent of Amazonian rainforest deforestation be in any way subversive? Weren't these really just the sounds of the strong overcoming the weak, Exxon overwhelming indigenous Columbians, or huge banks bribing our elected officials to rig our political system beyond all functionality? And weren't many of these supposedly groundbreaking bands just Rush or Ted Nugent in different clothing? And how could so much purported low self-esteem be broadcast so loudly, so proudly, from up on a stage no less, and with such strident rock pomp and ritual? Something just didn\u2019t make sense. So CAKE wanted to be dinky. Dubbed \"one hit wonder\" in response to every single album they have ever released, within this larger cultural context, their small sound was mostly just mistaken for weakness and their embracing of non-rock sonic elements was mostly mistaken for humor. Get it? It\u2019s not powerful, surging, straining Anglo-rock, so it must be a joke. Luckily there were a few people who understood CAKE, and for the St. Louis Dispatch CAKE\u2019s music was \"an utterly fresh sound, especially given today's preponderance of overblown \"alternative\" bands.\" And the San Francisco Bay Guardian even noticed that \u201cCAKE doesn\u2019t ask you to suck it\u2019s angst.\u201d Somehow a copy of CAKE's first demo made it all the way to France, where it was understood and well-received \u2013 \u201cThe drug dealers do not thank CAKE,\u201d astutely observed French music magazine, Les Inrockuptibles, So true.\n\nCAKE thrived in the unglamorous central valley of northern California, an area where country meets mariachi meets post punk and classic rock, a place where Sly and the Family Stone played on the same AM radio stations as Credence Clearwater Revival and Led Zeppelin and Chic. CAKE didn't choose sides, and felt mostly sorry for those who did. The idea of using genre as a badge seemed at its core wasteful. CAKE\u2019s belief that \u201ceverything is useful, and no entire genre of music can be all bad\u201d underpins their unusual sound, a sound that is hard to classify, yet somehow instantly familiar. When everything is useful, no entire genre of music can be wrong or right, and those who know who they are don't need to cling fearfully to just one thing, let alone to just one band. As a result of this basically utilitarian approach, CAKE would eventually collaborate with not only the Brazilian cultural hero Tom Ze, but also with rapper Jay-Z. Legendary country music artist, Buck Owens, even allowed CAKE to be one of the only non-country artists to play at his Crystal Palace in Bakersfield, CA. Very early on, when CAKE opened for legendary minimalist songwriter, Jonathan Richman, Jonathan pulled CAKE singer John McCrea aside and asked him when was the last time he actually enjoyed listening to live music. McCrea responded that usually it was a bit of a chore, and that his ears couldn't actually decipher that much musical information because of the super powerful volume. That's because, according to Jonathan, sound systems often create a live music experience that is too loud, too precise, and not actually viscerally enjoyable. For many years CAKE baffled sound engineers by insisting that microphones be used on vocals only \u2013 no more amplified high hats and amplifiers. Audiences, however, would frequently remark that they could actually understand the words in the songs -- this only bolstered CAKE\u2019s growing suspicion at the time that less is usually more.\n\nAs a result of this rather scruffy and low tech approach to live performance, CAKE was forced to learn how to play to a room, how to entertain and deliver to the smallest, seediest dive bar or the largest outdoor amphitheater. Traversing the continent sometimes three or four times in a single year in a Dodge passenger van that would frequently catch fire from overuse, CAKE narrowly avoided road death many times on the icy roads of New England. Gradually audiences began to seem less puzzled, offended, or furious. Some people even began memorizing and singing along to their songs, and CAKE began to miss the days before people thought they knew who they were, and what to make of them. Their song, \"Rock n Roll Lifestyle,\u201d from their first self-released album, Motorcade of Generosity, became a minor college radio hit. Eventually, they signed a deal with Phil Walden and Capricorn Records, which led to some actual worldwide distribution and success. The days of plastering up to telephone polls their own enigmatic band-designed posters and befuddling iconic artwork were soon ending.\n\nIn 1996 CAKE released their Fashion Nugget album, with \"the Distance\" and \"I Will Survive\" breaking through into all kinds of people's homes, rich and poor, educated and uneducated. Somehow the album presented a very multi-purpose array of musical communication that rung true at that time, often even with those who were getting tired of the ponderous, self-imposed trouble music of the mid-90's.\n\nCAKE's next album, Prolonging the Magic, saw the departure of Greg Brown, but also their most successful song, \"Never There,\" which even charted in such far away places as Brazil and Turkey. Brown was replaced on this album by Chuck Prophet (Green On Red), Tyler Pope (!!!), Jim Campilongo, Rusty Miller (Jackpot) and Xan McCurdy (the Loved Ones). Xan McCurdy, elected to stay with CAKE permanently.\n\nComfort Eagle, their highest charting album, featured Xan McCurdy on guitar, and presented such favorites as \"Short Skirt\/Long Jacket,\" \"Love You Madly,\" and \"Shadow Stabbing.\" Alternative Press noted that \"Comfort Eagle is infinitely smarter, smarmier, and catchier than Weezer's Green Album.\" Hmm.\n\nCAKE's most recent studio album, Pressure Chief, was met with critical praise for its signature match of \"post-new wave with smart lyrics,\" according to the New York Times, with the Boston Globe chiming in that \"after more than a decade of inventiveness, CAKE is far from stale.\" Sloppily careening between various genres until lines blurred and some people thought it became a \"sound,\" the members of CAKE have steadfastly maintained that they are simply enjoying a process. \"Music that defies simple-minded pop paradigms,\" the Los Angeles Times explained. \n\nWith few exceptions, CAKE has never believed in gratuitous musical change based on non-musical criteria like culture, tribal assertion, or marketing. Writers looking for a simple story or singular trajectory often criticized CAKE for not reinventing their entire sound with every new album product. For CAKE this quest for narrative always seemed wasteful, and not about the individual song as the entity of primary importance. But for many, this lack of singular narrative didn't matter because CAKE usually found more variance from song to song within the context of just one album than many bands find in an entire career. And although CAKE may seem resistant to overt change and difficult to write about, their dedication to the individual song hasn\u2019t gone completely unnoticed. \"A small number of bands can claim an actual catalog of worthwhile tunes. Count CAKE in that category,\" observed the Oakland Tribune. Billboard magazine described CAKE as \"A band that's hard to describe, but easy to listen to.\"\n\nA few years back CAKE created their own sporadic, but exciting Unlimited Sunshine Tour, which held true to their more or less anti-genre, music-first approach. In its first year audiences were surprisingly accepting of this philosophy, and the tour included such culturally incongruous performers as the Flaming Lips, De La Soul, Modest Mouse, the Hackensaw Boys, and Mexican favorite, Kinky. Later, such disparately defined acts would include Charlie Louvin, The Detroit Cobras, Cheap Trick, Tegan and Sarah, and the far out comedy of Eugene Mirman. CAKE looks forward to building another entertainingly disparate lineup for Unlimited Sunshine Tour 2011.\nMuch can be said or not said about CAKE's new label, Upbeat Records and their solar powered recording studio, but for CAKE it is more about independence and practicality than about being somehow \"green.\" CAKE has always been like a \"do-it-yourself\" craft project -- from studio engineering, production, mixing, album art, posters, and videos, to now having their own label, recording studio, and electricity. It's all a bit more work, but in the end so much more rewarding than having to work well with others in the old music business system, where unfair advantage is always held by those with the most offices and lawyers. The fact that the new album has been produced using 100\u0025 solar generated electricity from their rooftop is merely one byproduct of CAKE's long-term quest for independence from old, sick infrastructure.","booking_agent":"The Agency Group \/ The Umbrella Group","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Sacramento, CA","description":"\"We heard this hip little fuzzed-out tune on the radio, and we were, like, who's this cool new band?

{"about":" \"#thatPOWER\" with will.i.am feat. Justin Bieber available on iTunes now: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/ThatPower","band_members":"will.i.am\nfergie\napl.de.ap\ntaboo","bio":"THE BLACK EYED PEAS\nTHE E.N.D.\n\nThey are the best selling hip-hop group in music today, having sold over 26 million albums worldwide. In fact, they are one of the planet's most popular artists, and have toured more countries than any other artist.\nwill.i.am is not only the group's lead MC and its creative engine, but also an fashion designer, actor, social activist, and incredibly sought-after producer who has worked with everyone from U2 to Nas to Flo Rida.\nThe group's singing sensation, Fergie, has, in just a few short years, evolved into an actress, spokeswoman and fashion icon.\nTaboo and apl.de.ap, who started the group with will.i.am in the early \u201890s, have served as cultural ambassadors and have extended their hands into the worlds of acting and philanthropy. And together, the four parts of The Black Eyed Peas have grown the group into an unparalleled story of accomplishment.\nBut now, the moment has come for The E.N.D.\nNo, it is not time for The Black Eyed Peas to call it quits. The E.N.D. is The Energy Never Dies, the fifth studio album from the Los Angles-based quartet, and the group's most adventurous-sounding effort to date. It is an album that has the unmistakable club bounce and playful lyrical fervor fans have come to expect from the Black Eyed Peas. But it is also an album inspired by the underground world of electro and rock-infused house music, artists like Boyz Noize and DJ David Guetta (who both appear on The E.N.D.), Justice and A-Trak, and a world populated by raucous, all-night dance parties that are bubbling right now in every major city around the globe.\nThe end is more than just a new sound for BEP, says will.i.am. He describes the album's title as not about anything ending at all, but about the transformation of energy at a time of change. \"We are in the middle of a really defining time right now,\" he says. \"It's the end of the traditional era of how we experience and consume music and media.It's the end of the stereotype that we could never have a black President. It's the end of the usual ways of receiving information. But it's also the beginning of a whole new cultural birth.  So the title, The E.N.D. is not just about a new Black Eyed Peas sound but a celebration that change is happening.\nThe energy that pulses through The E.N.D. was born from will.i.am's fascination with the sound of underground dance clubs in his native Los Angeles - parties like LAX and weekly jams at places like Cinespace that host DJs like Crookers, Steve Aoki and others. When he went to Australia in 2008 to shoot a role in the box office hit, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, he discovered that the sound he enjoyed in Los Angeles was actually a shared worldwide experience, and that the culture reveled in the vitality of good music, not on any the pretenses of who was cool or not.\n\"It kinda turned my sh** inside out, to be honest,\" will says.Taboo, one of the group\u2019s lead MCs, immediately responded to the energy pulsing through the sound. \"It really reminded me of the days when we were just b-boys growing up in Los Angeles, and the people of that scene were so welcoming to having us be a part of it,\" Taboo says.\"It's really no different from where hip-hop started, if you think about it - it's just party music,\" will says. \"Sugarhill Gang was four-on-the-floor dance music, rapping over disco. Bambaataa used Kraftwerk for the foundations of hip-hop as we know it.\"The group became genuinely immersed in the scene, \"going out five or six nights a week to the different clubs and DJing the parties and dancing with the people and becoming a part of it,\" Taboo describes.\nThey knew inherently, too, that despite being one of the biggest artists in the world (and perhaps because of it), they needed to earn the respect of the people who populated this world. \"It feels good to fight for people to respect your artistry, and appreciate what you do,\" says will. \"It's not supposed to be handed to you on a silver platter; you're supposed to fight for it.\"\nIf the sound of The E.N.D. was inspired by the underground dance scene, then the album itself unfurls like one extended DJ set.\nThere is a pulsating energy and playfulness that transcends throughout, from the old-school electro-hip-hop sound of \"Rock That Body\" (co-produced by French DJ, David Guetta) to the back-and-forth energy between will.i.am apl.de.ap and Fergie on the song  On \"Electric City,\" a deep undercurrent of Jamaican dub and dancehall meets 3008 electro. \"I begged will not to write it without me when I heard the track,\" Fergie says. \"I was still shooting (Nine) and I begged him. I instantly clicked with that track. Fergie is most excited about performing \"I Gotta Feeling,\" which will be the group's second single. The song captures the pinnacle moments of a party, when nights kick into high gear. \"It's a party anthem and all we want to do is wile out,\" she laughs.\nContinually crafting new takes on The Black Eyed Peas sound is a part of the band's DNA and is evident throughout their entire discography. It's helped them become one of the rare hip-hop acts that can straddle the worlds of hip-hop and pop. The first single from The E.N.D., \"Boom Boom Pow,\" a refined, high-energy club-rap track, became the group's first single to ever top the Billboard 100 singles chart and was #1 for 9weeks, and its remixes featuring 50 Cent, Gucci Mane and Kid Cudi electrified the hip-hop blog world.\nMost recently, their album, Monkey Business, birthed two Grammy awards (Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group), and five Grammy nominations. It brought the group's total number of Grammys to three.\nSince those days after the release of Monkey Business, each of the members have taken the time to have their own adventures, which has helped them grow as individuals. will.i.am., not only ventured out into acting (X-Men Origins: Wolverine) but also released a solo album (Songs About Girls), produced for Michael jackson, U2 and helped make Flo Rida a rap star. Then there was his inspired creation of \"Yes We Can,\" the viral video and song that helped focus the cultural momentum of youth voters behind then-candidate Barack Obama. The track won an Emmy in 2008 and many observers cite the viral video (one of the most watched clips in YouTube history) as a sea change in the election.\nFergie rode the momentum of her multi-platinum solo album, The Dutchess and blossomed into a fashion and style icon. She also recently shot a role in the movie, Nine (the character Saraghina), with Daniel Day-Lewis, Nicole Kidman and Penelope Cruz. \"Singing in character and not as myself was so freeing,\" she says of the experience. \"It took all the pressure off that I usually put on myself.\"\nDuring his time away from BEP, apl.de.ap dedicated himself to both the creative and cultural. He played a role in an independent movie (Subject: I Love You) to whet his appetite for the film world. He also spent a lot of time in the Philippines, his homeland, and embraced a role as an Ambassador of Tourism for the island nation. apl also started the apl Foundation, which helps children in need throughout communities in the Philippines. \"The kind of experiences I had helped me really grow as a person as much as it did an artist,\" he says.\nTaboo, meanwhile, followed a path that was rewarding to him as an artist and as a family man. He acted in two movies (Cosmic Radio, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li) drawing on his extraordinary physical gifts as a dancer and martial arts practitioner for each role. More importantly, he felt he needed to re-dedicate himself to his family life after spending many years traveling around the world with BEP. He got more involved with his 15-year old son, Joshua, and married his longtime girlfriend last July. The couple are also expecting a child. \"To find that part of you that allows you to be a proud parent and to embrace a life of having love all around you, it's been a dream,\" he says.\nThe Black Eyed Peas have been so creatively consistent precisely because they recognize the importance of being able to step away and gain new life experiences. And something special happens when the four members come back together. When it came time to making The E.N.D., they found themselves inspired to make music together again. \"There was this feeling of excitement and a joy the guys and I had in getting back together in the studio again,\" Fergie says. \"I think The E.N.D. sounds like a party record because all we wanted to do when we saw each other was to have fun. We were inspired by the moment and the 'now' without having to look back.\"The ground beneath all is changing, in every facet of our lives, and The Black Eyed Peas have a grasp on it, musically, creatively and socially. And it shows that The E.N.D. isn't really the end at all.\n\n","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Pop\/Hip-Hop","is_published":true,"record_label":"Interscope Records","talking_about_count":147630,"username":"blackeyedpeas","website":"http:\/\/www.blackeyedpeas.dipdive.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"58332338082","name":"Black Eyed Peas","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/blackeyedpeas","likes":46176422,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151656174048083","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/934949_10151656174048083_157206778_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Tour dates, info and updates on day to day workings around the Ragan camp.","band_members":"Chuck Ragan - Guitar \/ Vox\nJon Gaunt - Fiddle\nJoe Ginsberg - Bass","bio":"Simply put, they don\u2019t make musicians like Chuck Ragan anymore. For nearly two decades Ragan has traversed the country and the world\u2014first with his celebrated punk act Hot Water Music and later as a solo troubadour\u2014to bring his music to the masses. Correspondingly Ragan\u2019s third solo album Covering Ground is as much of a love letter to his transient lifestyle as it as a concession to the loved ones he often has to leave behind and is also undeniably his most honest and accomplished album to date. \n\nFeaturing longtime collaborator\/fiddle player Jon Gaunt and bassist Joe Ginsberg in addition to guest appearances from the Gaslight Anthem\u2019s Brian Fallon, Blind Melon\u2019s Chris Thorn, Squirrel Nut Zippers\u2019 Chris Phillips, Frank Turner and Audra Mae, Covering Ground is the sonic equivalent to Jack Kerouac\u2019s On The Road and could only be created by someone who requires a release like this in order to stay sane. \u201cThe majority of these songs were written on the road,\u201d Ragan explains. \u201cWe\u2019ve been running hard and burning the candle at both ends for the past few years which has been amazing in many ways, but you end up making a massive amount of sacrifices to sustain that type of lifestyle.\u201d\n\nThis duality lies at the core of Covering and when Ragan sings about \u201cten cylinders that fire and a woman at the end of the road\u201d on the driving acoustic song \u201cWish On The Moon,\u201d it\u2019s dripping with so much authenticity that it\u2019s hard not to imagine yourself behind the wheel alongside Ragan. \u201cWriting has always been a form of therapy for me and something that I feel like I need to do rather than something I\u2019m supposed to do,\u201d Ragan responds when asked where the fire behind this songs originated. \u201cSince I\u2019ve started doing the solo thing in 2005 I\u2019ve been consistently writing and I\u2019m not worried about whether I finish a song, I just want to get this down to unburden my soul.\u201d \n\nMusically Covering Ground sees Ragan peeling back the layers of his songwriting style and allowing the talented cast of musicians to fill out the arrangements with their own voices. \u201cI really wanted to do a record that was going to transfer seamlessly into the live setting since we all spend so much time on the road,\u201d Ragan explains. \u201cI wanted this album to have more of a stripped-down and organic approach than [2009\u2019s] Gold Country.\u201d Correspondingly Gaunt\u2019s fiddle effortlessly weaves melody lines over Ragan\u2019s workman like acoustic guitar playing while peers like Fallon and Turner\u2019s guest vocals help add layers of depth to songs like \u201cNothing Left To Prove\u201d and \u201cWish On The Moon.\u201d \n\nDespite the fact that Ragan is working with instrumentation that has existed for hundreds of years, Covering Ground is also a remarkably diverse-sounding album and showcases the range Ragan is now able to attain with his whiskey-soaked pipes. In fact from the impassioned hymns such as \u201cMeet You In The Middle\u201d to gospel-inflected numbers like \u201cRight As Rain\u201d and instantly recognizable tunes like \u201cNothing Left To Prove,\u201d all of which prove how much Ragan\u2019s arrangements have grown since his first two releases. \u201cMaking this music is our passion but at the same time it\u2019s our livelihood,\u201d Ragan says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get jaded on the road; the struggle is trying to find that balance between work and passion.\u201d \n\nSpeaking of the road, since Gold Country Ragan has toured with everyone from Social Distortion to the Gaslight Anthem in addition to his own headlining shows and his appearances on the Revival Tour, a traveling road show that he started in 2008. \u201cThe tours we\u2019ve done over the past few years have been incredible because we\u2019ve played for a wide range of folks who wouldn\u2019t normally have any idea that we\u2019re around and that\u2019s a huge opportunity,\u201d Ragan explains. \u201cI feel like if people spend their time, money and energy to give us the time of day then we\u2019re going to give them everything we\u2019ve got every night.\u201d \n\nThat spirit of giving it his all is what separates Ragan from other songwriters and is also what makes Covering Ground such a timeless album that follows in the tradition of folk pioneers like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger. \u201cI used to build houses with a good friend of mine and even though I\u2019m doing this now the parallels in our lives are still identical,\u201d Ragan muses. \u201cOne thing he said with me that really stuck was that we have two choices in life: you either roll with the punches or lie down\u2014and only one of those is a choice for people like us,\u201d he summarizes. \u201cBeing a musician is a lot easier that some of the other jobs I\u2019ve had, but I\u2019ve still made the choice to work hard and keep going and that\u2019s a rule I live by every single day.\u201d \n","booking_agent":"The Agency Group- brucesolar\u0040theagencygroup.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"the road","general_manager":"brigitte\u0040brigittewrightmanagement.com","genre":"Folk \/ Singer-Songwriter","hometown":"Northern California","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Reybee - info\u0040reybee.com","record_label":"Side One Dummy","release_date":"\"Covering Ground\" - Sept 13, 2011","talking_about_count":811,"username":"chuckragan","website":"http:\/\/www.chuckraganmusic.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"219381158076295","name":"Chuck Ragan (Official)","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/chuckragan","likes":35452,"cover":{"cover_id":632800670067673,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/935601_632800670067673_824772208_n.jpg","offset_y":23,"offset_x":0}}

She would, they would hammer out danger and a warning all over the land. Delta Spirit have five hammers and they swing them the way Mary bobbled her head back in '63 for her close-ups, the way Mary sang as if her knees were on fire and her mouth was brimming with more ire laced with optimism than she knew what to do with. These Californians have more in common with the dirty haired, dirty fingernailed folk groups of the nascent years than they do any of their contemporaries. They're suited for reminiscent hopefulness and the gracefully youthful fusion of hostility and all-encompassing passion for all things that can set a smile ablaze or turn the hairs on arms and backs of necks into little beds of nails at the flick of a switch. They make lists of things they like, including all of the people they love, their home, pretty girls, desserts, bodies of water, justice and America. They believe there's still hope for it and in all of the rooms contained within the hallways of the band's newest offering, \"Ode To Sunshine,\" they make you understand that, when it's all boiled down, what we all ultimately live for is catharsis and a fulfillment of body meeting land, air and sea harmoniously. They're about bodies meeting bodies, pressing skins to skins. They're about reminding you to listen more than you talk. They're about urging you to put stock in the happiness of others, not just your own. They make it obvious that we have to go somewhere to be somewhere. We have to feel something to really live. They sing of the soul searchers. They sing for the soul searchers.

Recorded at Type Foundry in Portland, OR during the spring of 2011, the new album was produced by the band and Skyler Norwood and mixed by Tucker Martine (The Decemberists, My Morning Jacket).  Blind Pilot began in 2007 when Israel (vocals, guitar) and Ryan (drums) embarked on a West Coast bicycle tour playing mostly to unfamiliar listeners at small-town venues. The band now exists as a 6-piece ensemble featuring fellow Oregonians Luke Ydstie (upright bass, backing vocals), Kati Claborn (banjo, dulcimer, backing vocals), Ian Krist (vibraphones) and Dave Jorgensen (keyboards, trumpet). In the years since its inception, the band has toured with various world-renowned musicians including The Decemberists, Josh Ritter, The Low Anthem, Laura Viers and Andrew Bird and have appeared at the Sasquatch! Music Festival, Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits and the Outside Lands Music & Arts Festival.

{"about":"\"Old World Romance\" now available! Download on iTunes: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/oldworldromance ........ Webstore: http:\/\/bit.ly\/10XVrVC ..........................","band_members":"Alex Brown Church \nwith:\nLisa Fendelander -keyboards\nJoey Ficken -drums\nScott Leahy - electric guitar\nEliot Lorango -bass","bio":"As Sea Wolf, Alex Brown Church has kept us ensnared in his world of gorgeously lush and longingly moody tales of gypsies, wolves, foggy coastlines, redwood forests, metropolitan nightscapes and precarious loves since his 2007 debut. With his new album Old World Romance, released in September on Dangerbird Records, Church continues the story, delving into new territory. \n\nAn NYU film school graduate, and northern California native, Church has always taken the auteur\u2019s approach to Sea Wolf, infusing his lyrics and imagery with his experiences from the romantic grandeur of the West to the old school classicism of the East.  But while the scenes he paints in his songs reflect his dual penchants for dramatic natural landscapes and the headiness of urban life, under the surface they are most often about periods of change. \n\nIt was one of those periods that brought Church back to California to write and record Old World Romance, the third Sea Wolf album. While not confined to the concept of \"home\u201d, it is in many respects a homecoming album, its creation coming after the songwriter returned to his artistic base after three momentous years away.\n\n\"Some significant things happened for me while I was living in Montreal, but life happens all the time to all of us,\" Church says. \"A lot of the album is about facing realities, reconnecting with who you are. And a lot of that came from this complete sense of rediscovery of where I'm from \u2014 not so much L.A., but the West Coast in general. I felt a resurgence. I felt like this is where I belong.\"\n\nEnsconced in his home studio for the first time since he worked on his first Sea Wolf album, Leaves in the River, which was completed in Seattle with producer Phil Ek, Church was able to refine his craft, and readdress his old way of writing and recording. Mostly on his own, on his own time, with his live bandmates contributing here and there over the course of a year and a half. \n\n\u201cI spent a lot more time tinkering and writing more of the instrumentation myself again,\u201d  Church says, noting the change in dynamic from his sophomore album, 2009's White Water, White Bloom, which was written in Montreal but recorded with the full band in Omaha with producer Mike Mogis. \u201cI felt like I\u2019d learned enough to be able to self-produce,\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted this album to be more straightforward, more melodic, with simpler song structures. Much of it came down to my getting out of my own way,\" he explains. \"I wanted it to feel uncalculated.\u201d\n\nThose qualities are evident in the beautiful simplicity of the single \u201cOld Friend,\u201d the wistful optimism of \u201cChanging Seasons\u201d and the brisk missives \u201cDear Fellow Traveller\u201d and \u201cIn Nothing.\u201d Church's DIY approach to Old World Romance even allowed him to push his own boundaries, leaning away from the indie-folk instrumentation of his previous releases toward a new rhythmic electronic underpinning, perhaps most exemplified in the shimmering song \u201cKasper.\u201d\n\nThe ethos that created Old World Romance was fostered in Church's childhood. As part of an non-traditional family of builders with a profound appreciation of travel, adventure and the arts, Church spent his early years in the woodsy environs of Columbia, Calif., then lived in a tent in the French countryside for a year \u2014 taking time out to travel Europe \u2014 before his family finally settled in Berkeley. \n\nIn the Bay Area, Church's passion for music gravitated toward hip-hop and indie-rock, while his enthusiasm for writing and film grew. His artistic discipline solidified, however, during his time in New York \u2014 his NYU film studies and the influence and ambition of the city itself would profoundly inform Church as a musician.\n\nHis interests in film and music brought him to Los Angeles, where he soon befriended Brian Canning and Steven Scott, who would become his bandmates in the indie-rock outfit Irving.  By the time Irving released its second album in 2006, though, Church was restless. He turned his attention to the music project he'd been working on in the background \u2014 Sea Wolf, named for the Jack London epic. \n\nNot long after, he bowed out of Irving and Sea Wolf was signed to Dangerbird Records, which introduced its new artist by releasing the EP Get to the River Before it Runs Too Low in 2007. The single \u201cYou\u2019re a Wolf\u201d ushered Sea Wolf into the world with aplomb, quickly capturing the attention of radio and the blogosphere,.\n\nBesides his three albums, Sea Wolf contributed the tune \u201cSong of the Magpie\u201d to the audio book for author Augusten Burroughs\u2019 A Wolf at the Table. Burroughs had asked Church to read the book and respond with an original song. \n\nIt's all part of a remarkable run that has seen Church carve out a niche as a distinctive voice whose orchestrated allegories provide an antidote to the over-thought and overwrought. On Old World Romance the songwriter's meditations are as unvarnished as ever, exuding the kind of melancholy that begets clarity that begets hope.\n\n\"We're at a weird place in popular music where people are just recycling things, so I think it really just comes down to individual voices. Being back in Los Angeles, surrounded by other artists and friends and in the comfort zone of my own studio, has let me work toward being as clear as possible with my own voice. I felt inspired and rejuvenated, and I hope the album evokes that too.\"","booking_agent":"The Windish Agency - amy\u0040windishagency.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Los Angeles, CA","general_manager":"Redbird Management - tim.husom\u0040redbirdmanagement.com","genre":"Indie Rock","hometown":"Los Angeles, CA","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Good Cop PR - perry\u0040goodcoppr.com","record_label":"Dangerbird Records","talking_about_count":390,"username":"seawolf","website":"http:\/\/seawolfmusic.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"33531487937","name":"Sea Wolf","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/seawolf","likes":88199,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151116659002938","source":"http:\/\/sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash2\/s720x720\/396090_10151116659002938_908838459_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Nominated for Best Dance Recording Grammy with This Is What It Feels Like","band_members":"Armin van Buuren","bio":"Armin van Buuren has been named number one in the prestigious DJ MAG Top 100 poll four times in a row, as the first DJ in the history of the DJ Magazine and an indication of his prolific output over the more than 14 years he\u2019s been dj\u2019ing and producing. Being the official World\u2019s Most Popular DJ is just one of his many achievements, but the driving force behind his success is an overriding passion for dance music.\n\nA State of Trance\nThe Dutchman discovered a passion for dance music by listening to mix-tapes and radio shows, and taught himself how to create his own. 20 years later, his very own radio show A State of Trance has grown out to legendary heights. Nowadays, 15 million listeners tune into his 2 hour selection of trance and progressive, every week. For 9 years in a row and more than 450 episodes already, the A State of Trance show has been and still is a weekly highlight to many dance music lovers. \n\nAwards & Accolades\nEven a basic list of recent successes reads like a lifetime of work. Armin van Buuren isn\u2019t \u2018just\u2019 the number one on the critically acclaimed DJ Mag Top 100, but also holds the \u2018Best Global DJ\u2019 and \u2018Best Trance Artist\u2019 title, awarded to him at the International Dance Music Awards and Beatport Awards, respectively. Radio show A State of Trance received the IDMA for \u2018Best Mix Radio Show\u2019 for 5 years in a row. Furthermore, Armin was awarded for \u2018Best Podcast\u2019, became the most popular International DJ at Australia's Sony inthemix DJ Poll and, in March 2010, received the \u2018Gouden Harp\u2019, the highest distinction a Dutch artist can get. \n\nAlbums\nArmin van Buuren has delivered four successful artist albums so far, \u201876\u2019, \u2018Shivers\u2019, \u2018Imagine\u2019 and 2010 album 'Mirage'. As the first dance artist in Dutch music history, his \u2018Imagine\u2019 entered the Dutch Album Top 100 Chart at number one. Hit singles \u2018Going Wrong\u2019, \u2018In & Out of Love\u2019, \u2018Unforgivable\u2019 and \u2018Never Say Never\u2019 didn\u2019t only haunt the charts, but also became favourites of the dance crowd. The music video of \u2018In & Out of Love\u2019, featuring Dutch singer Sharon den Adel, received more than 67 million views on YouTube, holding the first position on the Dutch Top 10 of most viewed videos of all-time. Armin\u2019s back catalogue, including \u2018Blue Fear\u2019, \u2018Communication\u2019, \u2018The Sound of Goodbye\u2019, \u2018Shivers\u2019, UEFA Youth Championship theme \u2018Rush Hour\u2019, \u2018Burned With Desire\u2019, \u2018Exhale\u2019, \u2018Yet Another Day\u2019 en \u2018This World Is Watching Me\u2019, is full of timeless tracks that wear that classic-tag and keep returning to the clubs. But, as a true artist befits, Armin keeps creating new music and has now released his fourth artist album, 'Mirage'. For the album, Armin collaborated with the likes of BT, Christian Burns, Ferry Corsten, Adam Young and Nadia Ali. After the first single, \u2018Full Focus\u2019, the second release of the album was a collaboration with Sophie Ellis-Bextor, \u2018Not Giving Up On Love\u2019. The music video for the track was shot on party island Ibiza and includes shots of Club Amnesia, where Armin holds his residency. \n       \nPerformances & Armin Only \nBeing the world's number 1 DJ sees the Dutch DJ perform at some of the world's biggest and best festivals, clubs, events and shows. One of the highlights of 2010 was Armin's DJ set at the Museumplein in Amsterdam in July, during the honoring of the Dutch soccer team. Even though the national team  lost in the FIFA Worldcup, they partied like they were the absolute winners, and so did the 200.000 strong crowd. \n\nSold-out shows for Armin Only in 2005 and 2006 created eager anticipation of the third edition, which kicked off in a sold-out Jaarbeurs in Utrecht in 2008; over 16,000 fans attended and were enthralled by the DJ\u2019s nine hour set, under the name of \u2018Imagine\u2019.

{"band_members":"Greg-Vocals\nMichael-Drums\nBryan-Bass\nPete-Guitar","bio":"You can count the number of bands who've stayed together for 20 years on two hands, and you can use just one to count those who've consistently released quality material for two decades. This year, The Bouncing Souls enter that esteemed category, and in keeping with their D.I.Y. roots, they've done it without major labels, corporate radio, MTV, or teen magazine pinups.\n\nWhen married couples celebrate twenty years together, they're usually showered with anniversary gifts. The Bouncing Souls are celebrating their milestone by reversing that tradition and giving back to the fans, releasing one original song per month throughout 2009. More on that later, but first let's look back on some earlier days\u2026\n\nPicture it: 1989, a Knights of Columbus Hall in Bernardsville, New Jersey. A supportive music-loving teacher throws down $120 to cover expenses. A bunch of sweaty high school kids gather to sneak beers and rock all night at the debut show of a band called The Bouncing Souls. And a Jersey institution is born.\n\nBut the Souls' story actually begins a few years earlier than that historic gig. \"Pete [Steinkopf] and Bryan [Kienlen] had a cover band called The Switch around '86 and '87,\" recalls frontman Greg Attonito. The band was largely booked at parties teeming with college chicks and kegstands, and occasionally, their friend Attonito would join in to channel his inner Roger Daltrey or Billy Idol.\n\n\"Then we started another band called Brad Karma and the Absent Minded Fruit Bats,\" says guitarist Steinkopf. \"There was one song that we had called 'Quest For Goodie' and Greg would jump around and sing all kinds of crazy shit to it off the top of his head. We were all teenagers growing up in the suburbs, just looking to create our own fun.\"\n\nThe threesome spent ever more time hanging at shows in New York City and haunting Trenton's legendary, late, great City Gardens. The chemistry was undeniable and unstoppable, and it wasn't long before their creative juices flowed together. Tapping original drummer Shal Khichi, the band holed up in Greg's dad's attic and started writing what would make up the early Souls songbook.\n\nLike any young band with energy to burn and original songs under their belt, the boys took to the road in order to share their music and spirit with any crowd that would listen. While there were aspirations to find audiences across the globe, even college parties and basements were enough to keep hope alive in the early days. As bassist Kienlen puts it, \"We never spent too much time worrying about the future.  The point of the band was always celebrating the here and now, trying to make the best of whatever was in front of us at the time.\"\n\nThough it wasn't until 1995 that the band was able to tour on a full-time basis, they soon found the road to be a more frequent home than the comfort of their own beds. From headlining tiny rooms in remote towns to playing Wembley Arena with Green Day and Tokyo's Budokan with My Chemical Romance to spending time on seven different editions of Vans Warped Tour (totalling 11 months, with more sure to come), The Bouncing Souls have clocked more travel time than most airline pilots.\n\nSince 1996, the band has had a constant traveling companion and honorary fifth member - their primary touring vehicle, lovingly called The White Castle. For ten years, she gave dutiful service, until The Gold Tour, when her engine gave out - with 300,000 miles on the odometer. Regarding her decade of service before temporary retirement (the proceeds from that tour are rebuilding the old gal's guts), Attonito says, \"We converted those miles into road hours. Estimating about 40 MPH - because a lot of them aren't highway miles, with plenty of time sitting in traffic - it was staggering. Our estimate rounded out to 333.33 days driving in our truck! No exaggeration: that's about a full year!\"\n\nFortunately, there are many more tour dates in store for both the band and their beloved Castle. Exactly how many of those dates is impossible to say, though, since the band hasn't exactly been keeping score. \"I'd love to figure out how many shows we've played...I wish we kept count,\" says Steinkopf. \"I know bands that have and it's awesome. It must be way up in the thousands by now, though.\"\n\nFrequent attendees of those gigs (true believers, all) hail the Souls as one of the best bands in the world, and the boys feel the same devotion to their fans. \"Bouncing Souls fans are the greatest friends ever,\" enthuses Attonito, \"They're passionate and full of life. They really are part of the band in the sense that we're plowing a path through life together in good times and in bad.\"\n\n\"It's pretty much across the board too,\" adds Steinkopf. \"every age group...all different kinds of people. My favorite is when we meet people that were there from the start and now they have kids of their own that they bring to our shows. We really are a part of each others' lives.\"\n\n\"And any time someone says you've influenced them certainly makes an impact on you. To know that someone has looked at something you've done and they have taken something from it - whether it be in a lyric or the way you play your instrument - has got to be the highest compliment paid,\" says drummer Michael McDermott. As a final piece of evidence, Kienlen points to the MySpace gallery of band-based tattoos adorning their admirers: \"Last I checked it's up to almost 300 and counting. Our fans are hardcore in their unwavering support. We really are one big family.\"\n\nAnd families share things, which is why this year, the Souls have decided to gift their family of friends and fans with twelve spanking new songs, available for the standard less-than-a-buck download on the first of each month in '09, or for purchase on 7\" vinyl in quarterly compilations on their own Chunksaah Records (each featuring one additional bonus track).\n\nSteinkopf elaborates: \"We all decided that we wanted to do something different. We'd been on the same schedule for years: write a record, record a record, wait for the record to come out, then tour on it until we wanted to start the cycle again. We also wanted to break our own patterns and do something that was going to be inspiring and new for us.\"\n\nAttonito adds \"I remember being in New Zealand and saying we should do a release that doesn't come out all at once\u2026I was thinking in the context of a TV series. Somebody else might have come up with the first of the month idea but usually all the creative stuff we do is a process. Everybody kind of throws a stick on the fire at the right time in the collaboration.\"\n\nDoing it for the sake of the music, the fans, and their own inspiration for twenty years, the group \u2013 and their White Castle \u2013 are going pedal to the metal on a full tank of gas. According to their frontman, \"The shared driving force is part of the mechanics that keeps the beast truckin' down the next highway. We were - and still are - a few passionate, rebellious, creative, idealistic, party loving punks looking for a good time, for something to believe in, and for something meaningful to live for.\"\n\nWith twenty years behind these legends from the Garden State, there's a lot more still to come from The B.S. \u2013 and that's no bull.\n\n- Bruce J.

{"about":"Our new album \"Up, On & Over\" is available on iTunes, Amazon, Spotify and Rdio! http:\/\/smarturl.it\/UpOnOver","band_members":"Chris Henderson - Guitar\/Vocals\nPatrick Fetkowitz - Guitar\nMatt Warner - Keys\/Vocals\nRob Griffith - Drums\/Vocals\nBob Tanen - Bass\/Vocals\nCraig Struble - Harmonica\/Guitar\/Banjo","bio":"Bronze Radio Return know what it takes to get to the heart of American roots music. You have to go to America\u2019s roots.\n\nWhen it came time for the band to record their latest full-length album Up, On & Over, they found themselves in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains on a farm in the tiny town of Louisa, Virginia. In their journey as a band, recording in different parts of the United States has opened up their ears and minds. \u201cWe find it\u2019s easier to get into a creative zone when we\u2019re outside of our element,\u201d lead singer and guitarist Chris Henderson explains, \u201cwe were surrounded by goats, chickens, and farmland.\u201d The trek south this year was just the latest venture for Bronze Radio Return (Henderson, drummer Rob Griffith, lead guitarist Patrick Fetkowitz, keys player Matthew Warner, bassist Bob Tannen, and harmonica\/banjoist extraordinaire Craig Struble) who are no strangers to recording in new \u2013 and sometimes remote \u2013 places.\n\nTheir story starts in Hartford, where members orbited each other at The Hartt School, one of the country\u2019s top music conservatories. After finding each other and solidifying their line-up in 2008, they began writing music and found that their surroundings played a huge part in their creative energies. While writing their debut album Old Time Speaker, they bounced between the buzzing urban community in Hartford, where Henderson says melodies and chord progressions come naturally, and a remote Maine town, where they holed up to focus on lyrics. When they went into the studio in 2009, they went, as Henderson says, to \u201ca place we\u2019d never been before with a producer we\u2019d never met to play a bunch of songs we\u2019d never played before.\u201d The producer was Chad Copelin (Ivan & Alyosha, Ben Rector), who would go on to form a solid and lasting partnership with the band.\n\nTwo years later, Copelin brought the band to his home turf in Norman, Oklahoma to record their follow-up album Shake! Shake! Shake! The small community lived and breathed music. The Midwestern neighborliness and kindness shined through on the album \u2013 drenched in harmony, warmth, and soul, the songs were made to make people come together. Sing-alongs, foot stomps, hand claps, and all.\n\nIt was during this time that the band began to get picked up for numerous TV spots and ads. Shake! Shake! Shake! produced over 50 syncs in the past year-and-a-half when all was tolled. Highlights include a worldwide Nissan Leaf commercial and a national Behr Paint\/Home Depot ad. In addition, HBO, ESPN, NBC, MTV, the CW, American Idol, ABC Family, USA, and more licensed their music for shows, promos and bumpers. Instead of waiting for the syncs to break them out, Bronze Radio Return threw themselves into a rigorous touring schedule. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really fortunate to have our music used in a lot of TV and film, and also made some real traction at radio. But this band is first and foremost a live band,\u201d says Henderson. The band has spent the better part of the last two years playing every corner of the US and winning fans over with their packed-with-energy live show.\n\nCut back to 2013 and find Bronze Radio Return back in Virginia with Copelin at their side recording Up, On & Over, the band\u2019s most ambitious release to date. \u201cYou can hear there\u2019s an obvious progression with this batch of songs. It\u2019s very much still a Bronze Radio Return record but we really found ourselves getting into a groove during the recording process which allowed us as a band to dig deeper into the material than ever before,\u201d says Warner.\n\nThe album is a collection of songs defined by the band\u2019s ability to step out of their comfort zone and push forward. Leading the way is first single \u201cFurther On,\u201d an optimistic anthem steeped in summertime brightness. \u201cFurther On\u201d started making waves months before the album\u2019s anticipated release, when it was tapped as the soundtrack to the PGA Tour\u2019s national ad campaign featuring Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. The rest of the record follows suit with strong hooks, twangy guitars, and driving percussion. While we can\u2019t be sure where Bronze Radio Return\u2019s story will take them next, Up, On & Over is an exciting new chapter in their journey. Keep an eye out as their story unfolds, taking us all for a ride moving... well\u2026 Further On.","booking_agent":"Brian Jonas - High Road Touring - brian\u0040highroadtouring.com - 415-332-9292","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Hartford, CT","general_manager":"Chris Maltese - Maltese Management - Chris\u0040maltesemanagement.com \/ Keith Mahler - Handmade Entertainment -  management\u0040bronzeradioreturn.com","genre":"Indie Roots Rock","hometown":"Hartford, CT","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Stunt Company - Sue Marcus - sue\u0040stuntcompany.com - 718-222-8963","talking_about_count":366,"username":"bronzeradioreturn","website":"www.bronzeradioreturn.com www.myspace.com\/bronzeradioreturn http:\/\/twitter.com\/BronzeRadio","were_here_count":0,"id":"25326931728","name":"Bronze Radio Return","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bronzeradioreturn","likes":16029,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152282285851729","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1394213_10152282285851729_1460629407_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"'Hard Times And Nursery Rhymes' In Stores Now!  Get It At http:\/\/www.socialdstore.com","artists_we_like":"Lucero, Frank Turner, Chuck Ragan, Sharks, Gaslight Anthem, Suedehead, Fitz And The Tantrums, The Hives","band_members":"Mike Ness (Vocals, Guitar), Jonny Wickersham (Guitar), Brent Harding (Bass), Dave Hidalgo Jr. (Drums)","bio":"Here's how you know you've made it in the music business: You've stayed strong for three decades on your own terms, on your own time, by your own rules, and over that time your influence has only grown. Each of your albums has been stronger than your last. You've been brought onstage by Bruce Springsteen, because he wanted to play one of your songs. You've seen high times and low ones, good days and tragic days, but every night you give 100\u0025, and every morning you wake up still swinging.\n\nThis is the short version of the Social Distortion bio \u2014 the long version could be a 10-part mini-series. But over the past 30 years, the punk godfathers in the band have all but trademarked their sound, a brand of hard rockabilly\/punk that's cut with the melodic, road-tested lyrics of frontman Mike Ness. Their searing guitars and a locomotive rhythm section sound as alive today as they did in '82, as do Ness' hard-luck tales of love, loss and lessons learned. \"The most common thing I hear is, 'Man, your music got me through some hard times,'\" Ness says. \"And I just say, 'Me too.'\"\n\nHard Times And Nursery Rhymes (produced, for the first time, by Ness himself) is the band's first record since 2004, but the break hasn't changed them much. It maintains Social Distortion's key components \u2014 an all-but-perfected mix of punk, bluesy rock n\u2019 roll and outlaw country \u2014 but it also finds them stretching the boundaries of their signature sound. \"I didn't want any one style of writing,\" Ness says. \"I didn't want it to be all heavy, like \"White Light, White Heat, White Trash.\" I wanted some heavy and some light. I wanted some fiction and some nonfiction. I wanted versatility.\"\n\nThat's evident right away. The record's first vocal track, \"California (Hustle and Flow),\" finds Ness and the band not roaring out of the gate so much as swaggering behind a chunky Stones-style locomotive groove. \"This record has a lot of my influences,\" Ness says, \"But how far you go with those influences is up to you. With this record I wanted to go a little farther. I wanted people to hear that second track and realize, 'Wow, this is not just another Social Distortion record.'\" (For good measure the track has hints of \"Ball and Chain\" and the Stones' \"All Down The Line\" and, for the first time, female backing vocals. \"I've been listening to records for years with (backing vocals), and I was like, \"Hey, why don't I do that?\" Ness laughs.)\n\nNot that the band's punk foundations have eroded; the first single \"Machine Gun Blues,\" a piece of gangland fiction set in 1934, could hail from \"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell.\" But the record is evidence of the band's ability to evolve. \"Bakersfield,\" a setlist staple in recent years, is a waking-on-the-railroad-tracks story of wrecked love, forgiveness and Buck Owens; it closes with a spoken-word verse to make Merle Haggard smile. \"Can't Take It With You\" sports a Jerry Lee-style piano solo that scorches paint. And set closer \"Still Alive\" is a soaring carpe diem with an added emotional weight that can't be described or duplicated.\n\n\"The album is reminiscent to me of \"Somewhere,\" but it also has some of the darkness that \"White Light\" had. It has some of the flavor of \"Mommy's Little Monster,\" Ness said. \"I think it's very signature. We've never been afraid to evolve and show people what we can do.\" \n\n***\n\nNow in their fourth decade, Ness and Social Distortion have officially done one of the most non-punk things possible: They've failed to burn out.  \n\nMixing Springsteen\u2019s factory-overalls ethic with Southern California punk energy and black leather, Social Distortion formed with Ness and high school buddy, the late Dennis Danell, in the late 1970s; the group broke in 1983 with the thrashing plate of punk and displeasure \"Mommy's Little Monster.\" Their 1988 follow-up, \"Prison Bound,\" hinted at a sonic change to come, and by the band's self-titled 1990 record and 1992's \"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell,\" their sound had solidified into the instantly recognizable brand of rock n\u2019 roll that's defined them since. \n\nFor Hard Times, Social Distortion consists of Ness and longtime guitarist Jonny Wickersham, along with bassist Brent Harding and drummer David Hidalgo, Jr. \n\nThese days the band is rarely off the road for long, and continues to grip fans who have been around since \"Mommy's Little Monster\" while drawing new ones who discover the band through hand-shot YouTube clips. \"I see people bringing their kids to shows,\" Ness says. \"And I see kids bringing their parents.\"\n\nSocial Distortion is a mix of potent power, appeal across all age brackets and a genuine satisfaction at reaching as many people as they have. \"I write songs for myself, and I hope that other people will like them too,\" Ness says. \"I think every record you make is showing people what you've learned over the past few years. It's showing people, 'This is what I know.' \"\n\n","booking_agent":"Andy Somers at The Agency Group","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Orange County, CA","general_manager":"Relentless Artist Management","genre":"Pure Rock 'n' Roll!","hometown":"Orange County, CA","influences":"Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, The Clash,  The Ramones, Eddie Cochran, The Rolling Stones, Sex Pistols, Merle Haggard, Buck Owens, The Carter Family, Gene Vincent, Waylon Jennings and more.","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Jessica Giordano at Epitaph Records","record_label":"Epitaph Records","talking_about_count":2401,"username":"socialdistortion","website":"http:\/\/www.socialdistortion.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"7647794001","name":"Social Distortion","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/socialdistortion","likes":983323,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150748027354002","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/405154_10150748027354002_128629629_n.jpg","offset_y":28,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Sand & Snow out now on iTunes! http:\/\/bit.ly\/KKGMaQ","band_members":"Robert Stevenson - Vocals\/Piano\nAli Hussain - Bass \nSpencer Walker - Drums","bio":"\u201cThe first time we drove into New York we were all crammed in a tiny rental car. We came out of the Lincoln Tunnel and 'You Will Leave a Mark' was playing on the radio,\u201d A Silent Film vocalist\/pianist Robert Stevenson says, recalling hearing his group\u2019s career-opening single scoring a powerful moment of its inaugural 2010 U.S. tour. The Oxford quartet had just released its debut of epic and ambiently anthemic indie rock, The City That Sleeps, on Bieler Bros. Records, a Florida-based indie with an incongruously niche heavy rock profile. Despite the curious association, A Silent Film had an impressive American welcome. The group became the longest charting band on Sirius XM\u2019s Alt 18 Countdown, shifted 200K downloads as iTunes\u2019 Discovery Download, and sold 75K digital singles.\n\n\u201cNever in my dreams could I imagine the songs I wrote in my bedroom as someone else's soundtrack to the skyline of New York City. It was only three and a half minutes but it opened my eyes to the greater possibilities of sharing our music,\u201d Robert says. The American tour was a transformative experience for A Silent Film and the group decided to relocate to Arizona and record their sophomore album in the rustic environs of the West. The band\u2019s latest, Sand & Snow, to be released June 5th, 2012 is a snapshot of the fevered creativity inspired by an impulsive tryst with Americana. \u201cJack Kerouac and Bob Dylan are massive inspirations to me. I felt like I always had a kinship with America; as soon as I could experience it, and I didn\u2019t have to read it in a book anymore, I needed it for writing,\u201d Robert says of the creative necessity of the move. \u201cPreviously I had written everything in Oxford, but as soon as I saw America, it changed my process; I wanted to live and breathe it.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Robert Stevenson, A Silent Film is rounded out by Karl Bareham (guitar), Ali Hussain (bass) and Spencer Walker (drums). A Silent Film formed in 2005 and has garnered favorable comparisons to Coldplay, The Killers, and Snow Patrol. Its new offering is aligned with its formative poetic and expansive pop-rock aesthetic but there is a freshly confident depth and distinction evident in the writing. Sand & Snow is searchingly hopeful with emotive hooks and romantically purposeful lyrics.\n\nThe band self-produced this time in its new Arizona homespun rehearsal studio. The resulting production treatment is refreshingly contrasting with textural nuanced atmospherics boldly balanced by an earthy candor. \u201cSome of the vocals we recorded outside in the desert because we could. We dragged the cables out into a dry river bed and just let outside noises come out in the recording. I remember this noisy owl silhouetted in a tree. A producer wouldn\u2019t have it, and that makes things becomes mechanical,\u201d Robert says. Mix engineer Alan Moulder - best known for his work with The Killers, Death Cab For Cutie, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Foo Fighters - tied the seemingly incongruous approaches together with a mix that favors theatrical dynamics using the Arizona ambience as scene-setting flavor.\n\nA Silent Film had a 5 year history with a highly respectable alternative radio campaign and an impressive tour itinerary, highlighted by jaunts with One Republic and Civil Twilight, The Temper Trap, Smashing Pumpkins, Athlete and Sleigh Bells, but the band found itself when it found America. Sand & Snow documents the wisdom and romance gleaned from self-discovery from band with proven songwriting chops and buzzing career potential. \u201cOur story got started when we got on a plane and came to America in 2010, we felt like we had something to offer America,\u201d Robert says. \u201cWe felt defined by the music we made.\u201d","booking_agent":"Jordan\u0040FlemingArtists.com","category":"Musician\/band","description":"www.asilentfilm.com\n\nwww.twitter.com\/asilentfilm","genre":"Indie\/Alt\/Rock","hometown":"Oxford, UK","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":351,"username":"asilentfilm","website":"http:\/\/www.asilentfilm.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"36259564432","name":"A Silent Film","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/asilentfilm","likes":22826,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151898562424433","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1236269_10151898562424433_467939790_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

How did your classic struggling musician, who toiled away at coffeehouse gigs for most of his adult life, end up on the receiving end of a deal with a major label?

Surgieron en el 2000 como CIAO (el poder de los ni\u00f1os) cuando la edad promedio de los integrantes era de 11 a\u00f1os, cantando canciones italianas que fueron \u00e9xito en los 70\u2019s, con mucha ilusi\u00f3n y con un profesionalismo a flor de piel. Rompiendo la reticencia a los grupos pop que en el momento se pod\u00eda palpar en los distintos medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, fueron ocupando espacios y d\u00e1ndose a conocer como un nuevo grupo para el p\u00fablico infantil.\n\nLos a\u00f1os pasaron y  junto a la madurez que esto  implica, los gustos cambiaron y las metas como grupo tambi\u00e9n. De hecho, cambi\u00f3 el nombre: Kudai (una derivaci\u00f3n de joven trabajador en mapuche) los identificaba m\u00e1s con el per\u00edodo en que se encontraban y los temas a interpretar ya no ser\u00edan reconocidos \u00e9xitos del ayer, llegaba el momento de los temas in\u00e9ditos. Canciones que los reflejaban de mejor manera, con tem\u00e1ticas actuales, cercanas a la realidad del grupo y de sus seguidores.  Pablo Holman, Tom\u00e1s Manzi, B\u00e1rbara Sep\u00falveda  y Nicole Natalino se convirtieron en el nuevo fen\u00f3meno pop chileno, el disco \u201cVuelo\u201d editado en 2004, ubic\u00f3 en el n\u00famero 1 todos sus singles: \u201cSin despertar\u201d, \u201cYa Nada queda\u201d, \u201cEscapar\u201d y \u201cLejos de la ciudad\u201d.\n\n Un \u00e9xito segu\u00eda  a otro, VUELO se convirti\u00f3 en el disco m\u00e1s vendido en Chile en el 2005, se hicieron acreedores al premio APES como Mejor Grupo Juvenil y su m\u00fasica traspas\u00f3 las fronteras nacionales, cre\u00e1ndose m\u00faltiples fan clubs a lo largo de Chile y de pa\u00edses amigos. Todo iba viento en popa. Argentina, Colombia y M\u00e9xico, sab\u00edan de la existencia de este grupo chileno que estaba revolucionando el dial y las ventas en nuestro pa\u00eds, y poco a poco se fueron familiarizando con estos cuatro j\u00f3venes chilenos, de gran fuerza interpretativa, con un look muy particular y una contagiosa energ\u00eda en el escenario y fuera de \u00e9l. Todo parec\u00eda seguir su camino.\n\n\u201cSOBREVIVE\u201d fue el esperado segundo material bajo el nuevo nombre del grupo. Con el primer single, DEJAME GRITAR, Kudai lo volvi\u00f3 a hacer y se ubic\u00f3 en el  n\u00famero uno en las radios de nuestro pa\u00eds. Paralelo a esto, el \u00e9xito se hab\u00eda extendido al exterior: M\u00e9xico, Colombia, Argentina, Panam\u00e1, Ecuador, Per\u00fa, Venezuela, Bolivia son territorios que ya han contado con la presencia del grupo y donde su m\u00fasica ya cuenta con fervientes y leales seguidores. Adem\u00e1s son la voz oficial del tema caracter\u00edstico de una nueva serie de MTV: \u201cQuiero Mis Quinces\u201d.\n\nPero a\u00fan quedaba una nueva sorpresa, en medio de la primera gira oficial de Kudai por Latinoam\u00e9rica, Nicole decide dar un paso al lado. Era junio del 2006 y el primer quiebre de la banda se estaba haciendo realidad, por lo menos a los ojos de los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n que decidieron elucubrar con la salida de la rubia integrante.  No fue un per\u00edodo f\u00e1cil para nadie, Kudai deb\u00eda continuar con su gira y con las fechas ya pactadas, y deb\u00edan entregar un mensaje de calma a sus fans, que no entend\u00edan lo que estaba pasando. Fue en Ecuador, cuando la historia de la banda comenz\u00f3 a cambiar, present\u00e1ndose en el Festival EXA de ese pa\u00eds, Kudai conoci\u00f3 a Gabriela Villalba, qui\u00e9n estaba presentando su primer material como solista. Kudai y su manager la escucharon en vivo y quedaron impresionados de su trabajo y de su calidad interpretativa, por lo que al momento de tomar decisiones, la invitaron a que los acompa\u00f1ara en las fechas que ya estaban comprometidas, el p\u00fablico conoc\u00eda a Kudai con dos voces femeninas y as\u00ed deb\u00edan  continuar.\n\n\nNuevas nominaciones aparecieron en el camino, los premios MTV Latinos y los Orgullosamente Latinos, todos los ten\u00edan entre sus favoritos, definitivamente hab\u00eda que continuar el camino trazado cuando a\u00fan eran ni\u00f1os.\nPablo, B\u00e1rbara y Tom\u00e1s as\u00ed lo entendieron y continuaron entregando  su m\u00fasica en distintos escenarios, con Gabriela como invitada especial y con un futuro promisorio.\n\nTodo sigui\u00f3 su curso y octubre del 2006, marca un nuevo hito en la historia del grupo: Gabriela ya no es m\u00e1s una invitada, es oficialmente una Kudai, SOBREVIVE se reedita sumando un nuevo tema compuesto por Koko Stambuk. Esta canci\u00f3n se convierte en un emblema para los padres que han sufrido una separaci\u00f3n abrupta de sus hijos. Con \u201cTU\u201d Kudai cerr\u00f3 el ciclo de SOBREVIVE situ\u00e1ndose en los primeros lugares de los popularidad de Latinoam\u00e9rica.\n\nEn el 2007 el grupo se radica en M\u00e9xico haciendo gira por todos los estados de la republica mexicana, consolidando el \u00e9xito tra\u00eddo de centro y sudam\u00e9rica en tierras aztecas, dejando as\u00ed una plataforma s\u00f3lida para producir el tercer \u00e1lbum con el que se apunta a conquistar al mercado latino de Estados Unidos y Espa\u00f1a.\n","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Pop Rock Latin","hometown":"Chile","is_published":true,"record_label":"EMI","talking_about_count":49551,"username":"kudai","website":"kudai.com.mx\nmyspace.com\/kudai","were_here_count":0,"id":"12468588721","name":"Kudai","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kudai","likes":2903911}

{"about":"DEVOUR. Out now: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/dave-hause-devour\n\nMailing list: http:\/\/eepurl.com\/m2zPb","bio":"\u201cThe way we learned to live is fading fast\/I guess we never bargained for a crash.\u201d\n\n\nFor Dave Hause the American dream is a broken promise, a childhood ideal that has been shattered by the reality of the past two decades. On the musician\u2019s second solo album, Devour, Hause scours the foundation of that crumbled dream in an attempt to discover how everything we believed growing up could have turned out so differently. The album, initially written to become the third record from Hause\u2019s rock band The Loved Ones, follows his 2011 solo debut Resolutions, a disc that allowed the musician to understand his potential as his own artist. \n\nAs Hause, a Philadelphia native, began penning new music for a new album from The Loved Ones, it became clear that the group, who had taken a break after their second album, had stalled. These songs, however, which showcased a clear thematic journey, were meant to be vocalized by Hause and over the past few years he transformed them into Devour. Hause solidified the album\u2019s sequence before even going into the studio, aiming to craft a narrative arc that drove the album from its dark, heavy first half into a lighter, more hopeful tone. A thematic line of melody runs through the songs, reflecting the overarching ideas in the music itself. The disc explores the heartbreak of shattered childhood promises of a better world and concludes with optimistic hope. \n\n\u201cDevour is about that inherent American appetite,\u201d Hause says. \u201cIt\u2019s in all the songs in some degree. There\u2019s a reason why Tony Soprano became such a huge American icon \u2013 he\u2019s this guy with this insane appetite for women and food and power. I think for the American public to latch onto a figure like that says something. Some of the positive things about America come from that as well, but there\u2019s a real sense of reckoning that comes from devouring everything in front of you. Is it ever enough?\u201d\n\nThe rock songs, tinged with folk and punk tones, are firmly rooted in Hause\u2019s own upbringing and the sensibility that comes from growing up in a blue collar neighborhood driven by the lingering anticipation of upward mobility. In the lyrics, the fulcrum around which the album revolves, Hause grapples with this working class ideal and the fact that America\u2019s recent shifts have caused it to no longer fit. From \u201cThe Great Depression,\u201d which centers on the unfulfilled promises laid out in the Reagan-era \u201880s, to the more specific-minded relationships of \u201cFather\u2019s Son,\u201d Devour comes to terms with the loss of youthful innocence in a rapidly evolving world. \n\n\u201cI wanted to shine a light back on what was going on,\u201d Hause says. \u201cIt was a topic that was close to me and I wanted to write about it. In the end, it leaves you with the idea that if you have music and love you may be able to save yourself. It\u2019s going to be alright. That simple John Lennon concept of all you need is love. That\u2019s how I wrote myself out of the dark and the music begs the listener to come take that risk as well.\u201d\n\nOnce Hause had the track sequence and overall narrative in place he enlisted producer Andrew Alekel along with musician and co-producer Mitchell Townsend. The producers helped Hause collect the right musicians to build the songs in the best way possible, including My Morning Jacket keyboardist Bo Koster, Social Distortion drummer David Hidalgo Jr. and bassist Bob Thomson. Frightened Rabbit\u2019s Scott Hutchison, Alkaline Trio\u2019s Matt Skiba and The Watson Twins also appear on several tracks. Hause and his crew recorded the album over several weeks from mid-February to mid-March at Grandmaster Recorders LTD. in Hollywood, CA, focusing on giving each song the right tone while maintaining an overall musical aesthetic that helps tie the lyrical themes together. \n\n\u201cIt was this group effort,\u201d Hause says. \u201cA lot of trust went into letting Andrew and Mitch be the architects of the record. I trusted that we would get in there and they would know who was right for the music. They wanted to bring these people together in this great studio to get a record that was greater than the sum of its parts. I\u2019m glad I trusted them because it was great to work with everyone there.\u201d\n\nFor the musician, who has toured with Social Distortion, The Gaslight Anthem, Bouncing Souls and Chuck Ragan since launching his solo career, Devour is a cathartic release, both sonically and lyrically. Hause recently relocated to California and is committed to pursing the music he feels best reflects him individually. The journey on the album, the search for the light at the end of the tunnel, mirrors his own trek. The record closes with the delicate introspection of \u201cBenediction,\u201d a song that pulls lyrical lines from all the tracks that precede it. After all the ruined promises and the culminating disappointments of the world, Hause ends the album with the sentiment of possibility. \u201cIt's love my friend in the end that can save us tonight,\u201d he sings. \u201cSo are you in?\u201d ","booking_agent":"USA Andy Somers via Agency Group, UK\/Europe Tobbe Lorentz via Agency Group, Canada Adam Kreeft via Kreeft Booking","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Philadelphia, PA","general_manager":"Chris Fenn and Shane Trulin \/ Relentless Artist Management","genre":"Rock & Roll ","hometown":"Philadelphia, PA","influences":"Rock and Roll","is_published":true,"press_contact":"United States: tito\u0040bighassle.com \/ UK: em\u0040publiccitypr.com \/ Canada: cristina\u0040listenharder.com \/ Germany: mirko\u0040cc-ltd.net","record_label":"RISE,  XTRA MILE, Chunksaah, Bridge 9,  Jade Tree, Side One Dummy","talking_about_count":829,"username":"DaveHauseMusic","website":"htttp:\/\/www.davehause.com http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/hausedave http:\/\/www.davehause.bigcartel.com http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/davehause http:\/\/www.treatyourself78.blogspot.com http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/davehause http:\/\/www.reverbnation.com\/davehause ","were_here_count":0,"id":"153550194434","name":"Dave Hause","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DaveHauseMusic","likes":21505,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151887807994435","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash4\/s720x720\/1380836_10151887807994435_682920686_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"bio":"Recording artist, actor, philanthropist, restaurateur\u2026just a few of the befitting titles for Chris \u201cLudacris\u201d Bridges, who first gained worldwide acclaim more than 10 years ago with his debut album, Back for the First Time (2000).  Ever since, his unrivaled lyrical prowess, dynamic performances and timeless hits including \u201cStand Up,\u201d \u201cGet Back,\u201d, \u201cNumber One Spot,\u201d \u201cMoney Maker,\u201d and \u201cMy Chick Bad,\u201d have solidified him as one of music\u2019s best entertainers and led to the sale of more than 20 million albums domestically.  W\nith the 2013 release of LUDAVERSAL, fans can look forward to more great music from Ludacris.  \nIn addition to immense commercial success, Ludacris' consistent output of stellar music has garnered the admiration of his peers, as well as numerous awards and honors including three Grammys. \n\nThe same talent and versatility that Ludacris showcases in his music has enabled him to make a seamless and successful transition to acting, with acclaimed performances in films including Crash, Hustle & Flow and the #1 movie, No Strings Attached in January 2011, and television\u2019s Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, under his belt.  His work in Crash earned him the prestigious Screen Actors Guild and Critics\u2019 Choice awards.  He co-starred in The Fast & The Furious film series, Fast Five, which debuted at #1 in April 2011 and    in May 2013, he will co-star in the latest installment of the series, Fast Six.\n\nIn addition to his non-stop efforts in the studio, on stage and on the big and small screens, Ludacris\u2019 long held entrepreneurial spirit led him to open a restaurant, Straits, in Atlanta, GA in 2008 which he closed after 2 years in business to concentrate on the opening of his new restaurant, Chicken n Beer, which opens in Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, Concourse D in 2013.  Along with launching his own spirit, Conjure Cognac in 2009, Ludacris also entered into a partnership to launch SOUL by Ludacris headphones, which entered into the market in the summer of 2011.  Both of these ventures have captured the attention and affection of the public and firmly established themselves in their respective markets in a short time. \n\nAlthough one could wonder how Ludacris finds the time for anything outside of work, his artistic and business fortitude is only rivaled by his desire to give back and use his success to change the lives of others.  This passion inspired him to establish the Ludacris Foundation, a non-profit organization which seeks to inspire youth through education and memorable experiences to live their dreams by uplifting families, communities and fostering economic development. \n\nIn 2010, MSNBC.com named Ludacris, along with other eminent figures such as Oprah Winfrey and Warren Buffet, as one of today\u2019s most effective influencers on American culture.  With his feet firmly planted in so many diverse areas, we can certainly see why.

The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its family of the same name, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture, society, television, and many aspects of the human condition.The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u20131990).","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":1235,"website":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=jcJMPiM0tCwC&pg=PA287&dq=The+Simpsons+adult+animation&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0rWZUvMji_igBK3GgcAK&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=The\u002520Simpsons\u002520adult\u002520animation&f=false","were_here_count":0,"id":"109535305740402","name":"The Simpsons","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/The-Simpsons\/109535305740402","likes":11758343}

He is known for his deep, grimy voice and having a sophisticated and rugged flow. After releasing two albums with Heltah Skeltah, Nocturnal and Magnum Force, Rock left Duck Down Records and pursued a solo career. He signed to DJ Lethal's Lethal Records and recorded a solo album titled Planet Rock, which was never released after the label folded.

From his early verses on Craig Mack's \"Flava In Ya Ear (Remix)\" and \"Real Love\" by Mary J. Blige, it was clear to the hip-hop world that a new king had been crowned. Biggie solidified his position with his classic 1994 debut album, \"READY TO DIE.\" Through the combination of Sean Combs' powerful production and B.I.G.'s vivid rhymes, the disc brought Bad Boy Records to the forefront of East Coast hip-hop and went to sell over four million copies. \n\nTragically, this superstar's life was cut short on March 9, 1997, when he fell victim to a shooting. Released just two weeks later, the double album \"LIFE AFTER DEATH\" instantly confirmed Biggie's status as a modern musical giant. Universally considered to be among the greatest hip-hop albums of all time, \"LIFE AFTER DEATH\" went on to sell more than 10 million copies worldwide, fueled by B.I.G.'s timeless lyricism and such chart-topping singles as the classic \"Mo Money, Mo Problems.\" Since his passing, B.I.G.'s legacy been kept alive via such posthumous releases as 1999's double platinum \"BORN AGAIN\" and 2005's \"DUETS: THE FINAL CHAPTER.\" More significantly, he lives on through his profound influence on modern hip-hop.

Turning the standard concept of a hip-hop crew inside out, the Wu-Tang Clan were assembled as a loose congregation of nine MCs, almost as a support group. Instead of releasing one album after another, the Clan were designed to overtake the record industry in as profitable a fashion as possible -- the idea was to establish the Wu-Tang as a force with their debut album and then spin off into as many side projects as possible. In the process, the members would all become individual stars as well as receive individual royalty checks.\n\nSurprisingly, the plan worked. All of the various Wu-Tang solo projects elaborated on the theme the group laid out on its 1993 debut, the spare, menacing Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). Taking their group name from an powerful, mythical kung fu sword wielded by an invincible congregation of warriors, the crew is a loose collective of nine MCs. All nine members work under a number of pseudonyms, but they are best known as RZA (formerly Prince Rakeem; aka RZArecta, Chief Abbot, and Bobby Steels; born Robert Diggs), GZA (aka the Genius, Justice, and Maxi Million; born Gary Grice), Ol' Dirty Bastard (aka Unique Ason, Joe Bannanas, Dirt McGirt, Dirt Dog, and Osirus; born Russell Jones), Method Man (aka Johnny Blaze, Ticallion Stallion, Shakwon, Methical, and MZA; born Clifford Smith), Raekwon the Chef (aka Shallah Raekwon and Lou Diamonds; born Corey Woods), Ghostface Killah (aka Tony Starks and Sun God; born Dennis Coles), U-God (aka Golden Arms, Lucky Hands, Baby U, and 4-Bar Killer; born Lamont Hawkins), Inspectah Deck (aka Rebel INS and Rollie Fingers; born Jason Hunter), and Masta Killa (aka Noodles; born Elgin Turner).\n\nAlthough RZA wasn't one of the two founding members -- GZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard were the first -- the vision of the Wu-Tang Clan is undoubtedly due to his musical skills. Under his direction, the group -- through its own efforts and the solo projects, all of which he produced or co-produced -- created a hazy, surreal, and menacing soundscape out of hardcore beats, eerie piano riffs, and minimal samples. Over these surrealistic backing tracks, the MCs rapped hard, updating the old-school attack with vicious violence, martial arts imagery, and a welcome warped humor. By 1995, the sound was one of the most instantly recognizable in hip-hop.\n\nIt wasn't always that way. Like most rappers, they began their careers trying to get ahead whatever way they could. For RZA, that meant releasing a silly single, \"Ooh, I Love You Rakeem,\" on Tommy Boy Records in 1991. On the advice of his label and producers, he cut the humorous lover-man single, which went absolutely nowhere. Neither did the follow-up single, \"My Deadly Venom.\" The experience strengthened his resolve to subvert and attack record industry conventions. He found partners in GZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard. GZA had also released a record in 1991, the full-length Words from the Genius on Cold Chillin', which was preceded by the single \"Come Do Me.\" Both records were unsuccessful. After the failure of his album, GZA teamed with an old friend, Ol' Dirty Bastard, to form the crew that would evolve into the Wu-Tang Clan within a year.\n\nRZA quickly became part of the crew, as did several other local MCs, including Method Man, Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, U-God, Inspectah Deck, and Masta Killa. The nine rappers made a pact to a form an artistic and financial community -- the Wu-Tang Clan wouldn't merely be a group, it would be its own industry. In order to do this, they decided to establish themselves through a group effort and then begin to spread the word through solo projects, picking up additional collaborators along the way and, in the process, becoming stronger and more influential.\n\nThe first Wu-Tang Clan single, the hard-hitting \"Protect Ya Neck,\" appeared on their own independent label and became an underground hit. Soon, the record labels were offering them lucrative contracts. The group held out until they landed a deal that would allow each member to record solo albums for whatever label he chose -- in essence, each rapper was a free agent. Loud\/RCA agreed to the deal, and the band's debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), appeared in November 1993. Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) was both critically acclaimed and commercially successful; although its financial success wasn't immediate, it was the result of a slow build. \"C.R.E.A.M.,\" released in early 1994, was the single that put them over the top and won them a devoted following. The group wasted no time in pursuing other projects, as a total of five of the members -- GZA, RZA, Raekwon, Method Man, and Ol' Dirty Bastard -- landed solo contracts as a result of the success of \"C.R.E.A.M.\" RZA was the first to re-enter the studio, this time as a member of the Gravediggaz, a group he founded; in addition to RZA, who was rechristened RZArecta, the group included De La Soul producer Prince Paul, Stetsasonic's Frukwan, and Brothers Grimm's Poetic. The Gravediggaz's album 6 Feet Deep appeared in August 1994; it eventually would go gold. Labeled \"horrorcore\" by the group, it was an ultra-violent but comical tour de force that demonstrated RZA's production prowess. Shortly after its release, Raekwon released his first single, \"Heaven and Hell,\" on the Fresh soundtrack; the song was produced by RZA and featured Ghostface Killah.\n\nThe first Wu-Tang member to become a major solo star was Method Man. In November 1994, he released Tical, the first official Wu-Tang solo album. Again, RZA produced the album, creating a dense, dirty sonic collage. Tical became a big hit in early 1995, as did Meth's duet with Mary J. Blige, \"I'll Be There for You\/You're All I Need to Get By.\" Ol' Dirty Bastard followed Method Man's breakthrough success with Return to the 36 Chambers, which appeared in March 1995 on Elektra Records. Thanks to the hits \"Brooklyn Zoo\" and \"Shimmy Shimmy Ya,\" the record became a gold success. Out of all the solo albums, it was the one that sounded the most like Enter the Wu-Tang, although it did have a more pronounced comic bent, due to Ol' Dirty's maniacal vocals. Tales From the Hood, a movie soundtrack featuring Inspectah Deck's first solo track, appeared in May.\n\nLater in 1995, the two most critically acclaimed Wu-Tang records appeared: Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx and GZA's Liquid Swords. Raekwon released his album on Loud\/RCA in August 1995; the record featured extensive contributions -- a total of 12 songs -- from Ghostface Killah, his greatest exposure yet. GZA's solo album was released by Geffen Records in November 1995. In February 1996, Ghostface Killah's first solo track, \"Winter Warz,\" appeared on the Don't Be a Menace to South Central While You're Drinking Your Juice in the Hood soundtrack. Later that October, he released his own solo debut, the critically acclaimed, '70s soul-flavored Ironman; the record was the first released on RZA's new Epic subsidiary, Razor Sharp Records.\n\nThe Wu-Tang Clan finally reconvened and returned with their second album, the double CD Wu-Tang Forever, in June of 1997. Hugely anticipated, the album entered the charts at number one -- selling over 600,000 copies in its first week alone -- and quickly spawned the hit single \"Triumph.\" There were several contributions from guest associate Cappadonna (born Darryl Hill), who'd appeared on Only Built 4 Cuban Linx and Ironman, and would later become the tenth member of the Wu-Tang Clan. The group toured extensively in support of the album, getting into a few minor scuffles with the law along the way.\n\nIn the meantime, the next phase of the Wu-Tang plan started to take shape: unearthing new associates and spinning the resulting stable of talent into a brand-name franchise. A group of Wu prot\u00e9g\u00e9s dubbed Killarmy released their debut album, Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars, on Priority Records in August 1997, drawing heavily upon the Clan's martial imagery. 1998, however, was truly the year for Wu-related side projects. In March, Cappadonna released his solo debut, The Pillage, on Columbia. The same month, Killah Priest -- not an official part of the Clan, but a frequent guest and a member of another prot\u00e9g\u00e9 group, the Sunz of Man -- made his solo debut on Geffen Records with Heavy Mental, an acclaimed album filled with spiritual imagery that established him as one of the more distinctive solo artists in the Wu-Tang orbit. In July the Sunz of Man released their own debut album, The Last Shall Be First, on Red Ant, and yet another group of up-and-comers dubbed the Wu-Tang Killa Bees released their first album, The Swarm, Vol. 1, on Priority, featuring a number of guest appearances by Wu members and associates. In August, Killarmy issued their second album, Dirty Weaponry.\n\n1998 was also the year Ol' Dirty Bastard began a long and bizarre saga of erratic behavior and run-ins with police that found him making headlines with alarming (and ridiculous) regularity. In February he interrupted Shawn Colvin's acceptance speech at the Grammy Awards to protest the Clan's loss in the Best Rap Album category; shortly thereafter, he announced he was changing his name to Big Baby Jesus, an idea that never picked up steam. This was only the beginning -- over the next year and a half, ODB would be arrested for a litany of offenses that included assault, shoplifting, making terrorist threats, wearing body armor after being convicted of a felony, possessing cocaine, and missing countless court dates. Plus, in early 1999, the whole Clan fell under suspicion of masterminding a gun-running operation between Staten Island and Steubenville, OH -- charges that were never proven to have any validity.\n\nIn the midst of this legal sideshow, the Clan kicked off a second round of solo projects in late 1998. This time around, RZA curtailed his activities somewhat, making appearances but often leaving the majority of the production duties to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Still, he released his own solo debut, the soundtrack-styled RZA as Bobby Digital in Stereo, in November 1998 on V2; the same month, Method Man's second album, Tical 2000: Judgement Day, debuted at number two on the charts. June 1999 saw the release of an excellent singles compilation, RZA Hits, which covered the first Wu-Tang album and the first round of solo albums (1994-1995); the very next week, GZA's second album, Beneath the Surface, was released. September brought plenty of new Wu product: Ol' Dirty Bastard's Nigga Please, released while the rapper was in rehab; Method Man's acclaimed duo album with Redman, Blackout!; and the first-ever solo album by Inspectah Deck, Uncontrolled Substance, which appeared on Relativity. Another Wu member made his solo debut in October, when U-God issued Golden Arms Redemption on Priority; Raekwon returned the following month with Immobilarity. Finally, Ghostface Killah issued his well-received sophomore set, Supreme Clientele, in January 2000.\n\nHowever, this second round of Wu-Tang solo albums didn't attract as much attention, either critically or commercially. True, Method Man remained a popular solo star (and, to a lesser degree, so did ODB), and reviews were highly positive for Ghostface Killah (and, to a lesser degree, GZA). But the Wu franchise was suffering from inconsistency, overexposure (they'd spawned a clothing line, a video game, a comic book, and more), and a flood of musical product that even diehards found difficult to keep up with. Their once-distinctive sound was becoming commonplace and diluted, not just through the collective's own releases but also RZA's many imitators; plus, by this time, Timbaland had taken over the mantle of hip-hop's most cutting-edge producer.\n\nIndie filmmaker Jim Jarmusch commissioned RZA to compose a soundtrack for his acclaimed Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, the results of which were unveiled in early 2000. Other than that, the Clan reconvened for a new album and was mostly quiet during much of 2000 -- aside from Ol' Dirty Bastard, who unfortunately continued to spiral out of control. He spent some time in a California jail for violating the terms of his probation, but appeared to be on the right track when suddenly, in October -- with just two months of rehab to go -- he escaped the California facility and spent a month on the run from the law. Fans were shocked when ODB turned up on-stage at the New York record-release party for the Clan's new album, The W, which was released with considerably less fanfare in November 2000. A leaner, more focused collection, The W featured only one track from ODB and pictured Cappadonna as a full-fledged member of the group (though he remained unnamed on their official contract with Loud).\n\nODB managed to exit the club after his surprise performance but was soon captured by police in Philadelphia and extradited to New York to face charges of cocaine possession. In April 2001, he cut a deal with prosecutors that resulted in a sentence of two to four years in state prison, bringing his outlaw saga to a sad end. In August 2001, RZA issued his second Bobby Digital album, Digital Bullet; November brought solo albums from Ghostface Killah (Bulletproof Wallets) and Cappadonna (The Yin and the Yang). This time, though, there was no full round of solo projects in between Wu albums; the full group (minus ODB) assembled for their fourth album, Iron Flag, which was released in December 2001, just one year after its predecessor. Despite a lot of activity for the various solo projects, Wu-Tang released only a live album, 2004's Disciples of the 36 Chambers, during the subsequent five years. That document was one of the last places to hear Ol' Dirty Bastard, who died of a heart attack in November 2004. In early 2007, in anticipation for the Clan's upcoming album, 8 Diagrams, Nature Sounds issued the Mathematics-compiled Unreleased, a collection of new remixes and hard-to-find, previously unreleased songs from the group and some of their friends. It wasn't until the end of the year, however -- after a couple of delays and some criticism from Raekwon and Ghostface directed at RZA regarding the overall sound of the record -- that 8 Diagrams came out. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine & Steve Huey, All Music Guide","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"info\u0040wutangclan.com  wutangbrand\u0040gmail.com","genre":"Hip Hop","hometown":"Shaolin, New York","is_published":true,"record_label":"Wu Music Group\/Wu Tang Production Inc.","talking_about_count":86572,"username":"wutangclan","website":"http:\/\/www.wumusicgroup.com http:\/\/www.wutangclan.com\/\/www.wutangbrand.com http:\/\/wudisciples.blogspot.com http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/WuTangclan.com ","were_here_count":0,"id":"57878559811","name":"Wu-Tang Clan","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wutangclan","likes":2240760,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151997289684812","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1470274_10151997289684812_941282776_n.png","offset_y":50,"offset_x":0}}

Mom brought up her sons within the foundations of faith and family afforded by St. Elmo\u2019s Missionary Baptist Church, for which she served as choir director.  As early as junior high school, Usher began entering local talent shows.  He was performing at a \u201cStar Search\u201d competition at age 13 when he was spotted by an A&R rep from LaFace who arranged an audition with L.A. Reid.  A record contract soon followed.  \u201cI have been building my career since I was a little boy,\u201d Usher explains, \u201cbecause singing had always been what I wanted to do.  At first I thought about playing [professional] football, then I wanted to play basketball, but in the end it was all about the music.  It\u2019s my biggest passion and my biggest joy.\u201d\n\nUsher was one month shy of his 15th birthday when his modest debut LaFace single made the R&B chart in late-\u201993, \u201cCall Me a Mack,\u201d from the movie soundtrack of John Singleton\u2019s Poetic Justice.  One year later, Usher, his self-titled debut album arrived, co-executive produced by Sean \u201cPuff Daddy\u201d Combs.  It rose to #25 on the R&B chart on the strength of three singles: \u201cCan U Get Wit It,\u201d \u201cThink Of You\u201d (top 10, written and produced by label mate Donell Jones, with a rap by Biz Markie), and \u201cThe Many Ways\u201d (with Al B.

Ya en una edad madura forma el exitoso grupo \u201cLu\u201d, con el cu\u00e1l tuvo gran aceptaci\u00f3n en el mercado mexicano, latino y americano. Es en el a\u00f1o 2002 cuando firma contrato con la editora Warner Chappell quienes hicieron el acercamiento con su actual compa\u00f1\u00eda disquera Warner Music. Son dos discos los que lanza con este dueto con los cu\u00e1les logr\u00f3 certificaciones de Disco de Oro en M\u00e9xico.\n\nAl separarse del dueto \u201cLu\u201d Mario Sandoval comienza a trabajar en su proyecto personal. As\u00ed es como Mario define su cambio de \u201cLu\u201d a \u201cSANDOVAL\u201d: \u201cLu fue la tesis, \u00a1ahora s\u00ed vamos a trabajar!\u201d .\n\nPero SANDOVAL no es un proyecto de una sola persona. Con Mario a la cabeza del plan, tambi\u00e9n participan en \u00e9l tres personas m\u00e1s que imprimen talento y dan un toque caracter\u00edstico que logra la esencia \u00fanica y el sonido especial de la banda. Susy Ortiz es quien lleva la parte vocal y arm\u00f3nica de la banda, Alejandro es el encargado de la bater\u00eda y Enrique se encuentra en el bajo. Los tres se integraron a SANDOVAL primordialmente por una relaci\u00f3n de amistad con Mario: \u201cSusy Ortiz es hermana de una muy amiga m\u00eda y mi vecina, tenemos los mismos amigos en com\u00fan. Un d\u00eda la escucho cantar y me doy cuenta del gran talento y de lo \u00fanico y original de su voz. Al final de cuentas mucho de lo que busco es la armon\u00eda dentro de SANDOVAL y Susy como amiga, confidente y compa\u00f1era de voz me ha dado todo lo que necesito para seguir en este proyecto. Enrique y Alex son unos tipos espectaculares en los cuales veo lo que necesito para darle vida a este grupo, ellos fueron mi baterista y mi bajista en Lu. Estoy feliz de estar con ellos\u201d, comenta Mario al referirse a los miembros de SANDOVAL.\n\nEs as\u00ed como Mario, Susy, Kike y Alex forman parte de este proyecto llamado SANDOVAL. El nombre de la banda es b\u00e1sicamente el apellido de Mario, de esta forma \u00e9l hace de este proyecto lo m\u00e1s personal de su carrera y tambi\u00e9n arropa a sus colegas dentro de un nombre que es m\u00e1s que un apellido, es una puerta abierta a formar parte de una familia muy especial.\n\nYa con la banda formada Mario se dio a la tarea de componer las canciones que forman parte del \u00e1lbum debut de este proyecto. El proceso de composici\u00f3n se bas\u00f3 en la esencia primordial de Mario, misma esencia que imprimi\u00f3 en su proyecto anterior y que le ha dejado grandes logros y satisfacciones\n\nEl \u00e1lbum fue grabado en Valencia, Espa\u00f1a, en los meses de septiembre y octubre del 2008 bajo la producci\u00f3n de Juan Luis Gim\u00e9nez de Presuntos Implicados (Efecto Mariposa, Conchita). Meses antes, Mario Sandoval hab\u00eda trabajado ya todas las bases e instrumentaci\u00f3n desde su estudio en M\u00e9xico. La mezcla y masterizaci\u00f3n se llevaron a cabo en Madrid, Espa\u00f1a.\n\n\u201cJuan Luis Gim\u00e9nez es una persona encantadora, alguien a quien admiro por la elegancia de su m\u00fasica. La conexi\u00f3n entre Juan y nosotros fue muy especial\u201d \u2013 dice Mario al respecto.\n\nEste disco cuenta con invitados muy especiales, tales son los casos de Lidia, la nueva vocalista de Presuntos Implicados, quien pone delicadeza y estilo a la canci\u00f3n \u201cElla\u201d y Chico Castillo, ex Gipsy Kings quien junto con Mario compuso el tema \u201cDe Madrid Al Cielo\u201d.\nSANDOVAL nos trae en este nuevo material un completo men\u00fa de canciones pop que con temas de amor y desamor se van llevando de la mano uno a uno logrando que no podamos dejar de escuchar el disco de principio a fin.

You're welcome to give it a shot, plenty of people have, calling them at times a heartfelt acoustic trio, a wailing rock band, a devil-may-care funk act, but the band defies epithets at every turn. When they hear a description of their music, they just grab the closest instrument and switch things up in an effort to keep the stereotype-slingers at bay. It's nothing personal, it's just that they find inventiveness more interesting than playing it safe and churning out the kind of neat little ditties that people listen to for a week and then forget. \n\nWhile Dispatch has managed to keep itself comfortably outside the chintzy glare of pop music's spotlight, the industry nonetheless noticed them. Rolling Stone hailed Who Are We Living For? as one of the 10 best albums of 2001, and more than a few heads turned when that record debuted at 18 on Billboard's internet sales chart (ahead of Sting!). For almost ten years, the three members of Dispatch cranked out music on their own label, Bomber Records, without help from a major record company. Propelled by the word-of-mouth and internet campaigning of their massive underground fan base, Dispatch has seen coast-to-coast sellouts at major venues like Roseland (NYC), the Fillmore (San Francisco), the Fillmore (Denver), Central Park (NYC), the Electric Factory (Philadelphia), the Fleet Pavilion (Boston), the 9:30 Club (DC), and many more. \n\nBut the concert to top all concerts was The Last Dispatch, a free musical farewell at the Hatch Shell in Boston in July 2004. When the three college friends decided to call it quits, over 110,000 fans from 25 countries mobbed the unsuspecting venue, making it the largest independent music event in history (outdrawing Phish's swan song by 50,000 and the multi-band fest Bonnaroo by almost 20,000). \n\nIn July 2007, the trio reunited for \"DISPATCH: ZIMBABWE\", an unprecedented three-night benefit at Madison Square Garden in NYC. Dispatch became the first independent band to sell-out the legendary arena (three nights no less) and more importantly, proved the healing power of music as the band and fans collectively raised funds and awareness for poverty stricken Zimbabwe.","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Rock","hometown":"Boston, MA","is_published":true,"record_label":"Bomber Records","talking_about_count":777,"username":"dispatch","website":"www.dispatchmusic.com www.dispatchmerch.com www.facebook.com\/dispatch www.twitter.com\/dispatchmusic ","were_here_count":0,"id":"8521356202","name":"DISPATCH","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dispatch","likes":303143,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151688402346203","source":"http:\/\/sphotos-b.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/s720x720\/6968_10151688402346203_1453106019_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"by fans of his memory","bio":"While he was most famous for his rap career, but was also a gifted actor, poet and a thoughtful while outspoken advocate for the poor and the overlooked in America. During his life, he produced an immense amount of artistic work, which included albums, major Hollywood feature films, and published works. He was most prolific in the music industry, selling over 75 million albums. Tupac\u2019s unapologetic lyrics were relevant, important, and reflective of the hard lives led by many. His music earned attention and respect through a poetic style that embraced street vocabulary while being innovative and he is still considered by many to be one of the biggest influences on modern hip hop.\n\n\n\nTupac\u2019s career has earned him 6 Grammy nominations and three MTV Video Music Award nominations. Shakur was honoured by the American Music Awards as the Favourite Hiphop Artist in 1997.\n\n\n\nBorn on June 16 1971 in New York City, Shakur\u2019s parents were both members of the Black Panther Party whose militant style and provocative ideologies for civil rights would come to influence Tuapc\u2019s music. At an early age, Tuapc\u2019s love for performance and the arts began to show, as he began acting at age 13 and later enrolled in the Baltimore School of the Arts before dropping out at 17. Shakur broke into the music business with rap group Digital Underground as a back-up dancer and roadie. Eventually Shakur released his first solo album in \u201991, 2pacalypse Now. Now sporting the stage name 2pac, Shakur\u2019s music career began to grow as his second album, Strickly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z included 2 top 20 pop chart tracks: I Get Around and Keep Ya Head Up.\n\n\n\nShakur\u2019s legal battles began after he established his rap career. In the early nineties Shakur faced a wrongful death suit which settled out of court, accusations of assaulting police officers where charges were ultimately dropped, and even an incident where Shakur sustained 5 gunshot wounds from unknown assailants. In 1995 Tupac was sentenced one-and-a-half to four-and-a-half years in prison for sexual assault. However, not even prison could slow the success of Shakur\u2019s career.\n\n\n\nWhile incarcerated Tupac\u2019s latest album, Me Against the World, was number one in the pop charts and would later go double platinum. Shakur become the first artist to reach number one in the pop chart while serving a prison sentence. Making the most of his time in jail, Tupac became an passionate reader. Among his favourites were the works of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, an italian Renaissance writer whose works were in part the foundation for western political science. Shakur\u2019s appreciation of his work inspired the nickname: Makaveli.\n\n\n\nAfter serving only 8 months of his sentence, Tupac was out on parole thanks to a 1.4 million dollar bond paid by Suge Knight, CEO of Death Row records. Now signed on Death Row records, Shakur went on to create All Eyez on Me, which featured hits How Do You Want It and California Love.\n\n\n\nTupac\u2019s life was cut short in September of 1996 when Shakur became the victim of a drive-by shooting while his car waited on a red light. Inspite surviving the surgery that followed, Shakur was pronounced dead almost a week after the attack.\n\n\n\nEven today, Tupac\u2019s musical influence is wide-spread from the library of congress where his song Dear Mama was added in 2010 to the national registry, to artists like 11 time Grammy winner Eminem who in an interview with MTV said:\n\n\n\n\u201cHe made you feel like you knew him. I think that honestly, Tupac was the greatest songwriter that ever lived. He made it seem so easy. The emotion was there, and feeling, and everything he was trying to describe. You saw a picture that he was trying to paint.\u201d\n\n\n\nTupac leaves a legacy of honestly and passion in his songs. Respected by many, Tupac has become an inspiration for artists and a standard in rap music.","category":"Musician\/band","description":"Musician, Actor, Poet, Activist, and Inspiration.","genre":"Rap\/Hip-hop","hometown":"New York","is_published":true,"record_label":"Interscope, Amaru, DeathRow","talking_about_count":96690,"username":"tupacshakurfan","were_here_count":0,"id":"185282101484120","name":"Tupac","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tupacshakurfan","likes":2053604,"cover":{"cover_id":488345847844409,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/217862_488345847844409_1054774447_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"category":"Musician\/band","description":"Ludwig van Beethoven was a German composer and pianist. A crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western art music, he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers. His best known compositions include 9 symphonies, 5 concertos for piano, 32 piano sonatas, and 16 string quartets. He also composed other chamber music, choral works (including the celebrated Missa Solemnis), and songs.Born in Bonn, then the capital of the Electorate of Cologne and part of the Holy Roman Empire, Beethoven displayed his musical talents at an early age and was taught by his father Johann van Beethoven and Christian Gottlob Neefe. During his first 22 years in Bonn, Beethoven intended to study with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and befriended Joseph Haydn. Beethoven moved to Vienna in 1792 and began studying with Haydn, quickly gaining a reputation as a virtuoso pianist. He lived in Vienna until his death. In about 1800 his hearing began to deteriorate, and by the last decade of his life he was almost totally deaf. He gave up conducting and performing in public but continued to compose; many of his most admired works come from this period.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":5153,"website":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/?id=VQw5AAAAIAAJ","were_here_count":0,"id":"110664992295466","name":"Beethoven","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Beethoven\/110664992295466","likes":2375897}

{"about":"'Almer\u00eda' available now on iTunes! http:\/\/smarturl.it\/Almeria","band_members":"Jason Wade\nBryce Soderberg\nRicky Woolstenhulme, Jr.\nBen Carey","bio":"For the duration of Los Angeles-based Lifehouse's ten-year career they've been delicately balancing two identities: radio-ready song craftsmen and raucous live rock and roll band. On their forthcoming fifth studio album, Smoke & Mirrors, the band finally unites these two personalities. \"We toured for over a year  before we started making this record,\" says singer and guitarist Jason Wade. \"With the new album we really wanted to capture what we were doing on the road but halfway through recording, it was apparent we hadn\u2019t focused enough on the equally important radio side.  It finally dawned on us to just do both.\" \n\nStill in their twenties, the guys in Lifehouse have an impressive resume. Founding members Jason Wade and drummer Ricky Woolstenhulme Jr. met in Los Angeles and formed the band in the late 90s. Lifehouse released its smash debut No Name Face in 2000, which launched them to global stardom. Their breakout single \"Hanging by a Moment\" was the single most played radio track of 2001. Over the next few years \u2013 joined first by a replacement, bassist Bryce Soderberg and more recently by new member, guitarist Ben Carey - Lifehouse built upon that initial success.  Combined album sales are over 5 million and Lifehouse singles have sold over 3 million copies online including number one hits  \"Hanging By a Moment\" and \"You and Me.\" Later Lifehouse singles \"First Time,\" \"Whatever It Takes,\" and \"Broken\" have also achieved major chart and sales success. From very early on, Lifehouse fans demonstrated a resilient loyalty to the band, so much so that several of the band's hits still maintain chart positions on iTunes, years after their initial release. The band also has a formidable online presence \u2013 their video streams are at 70 million and counting. \n\nLifehouse has always done well on radio, TV, and online, but just as impressive is their take-no-prisoners approach to touring. \"We stayed out on the road for the last ten years,\" Jason says. \"Even through the hard times we played four to six shows a week. We refused to disappear (laughs)!\u201d  When Lifehouse's fourth album Who We Are came out in the spring of 2007 it set the band on a near-relentless tour that should have pushed them to the brink of insanity. Instead, they hung out on days off and made the road a way of life. \"We really love being on the road,\" Ricky says. \"We enjoy playing live, feeling that energy. And when we have time off we have a good time doing whatever. We go to basketball and love to eat! I'm like the camp counselor \u2013 I track everything down and make all the plans. Even if they don\u2019t want to go, they have to. I'm that guy.\"\n\nIn the fall of 2008, when the band finally came off the road from supporting Who We Are, they were on a post-tour high and urgently wanted to bring that visceral live energy to the next album. So they got together with Jude Cole, the producer of Who We Are, and began working on new material both at Cole's Ironworks Studio and at Jason's recently built home studio, Castle View. But instead of putting themselves on their usual strict schedule, the band decided to take their time with this record. As a result, it was a real creative journey. \"We knew we were in a good place where we could afford to stay off the road and keep the crew employed and happy, and basically just develop the band a little bit - go in a few different directions,\" Bryce explains. \"We experimented with Americana, classic rock, pop - we tried a bunch of different styles, really growing even further as a band.\u201d  \n\nLifehouse ended up spending a year recording upwards of thirty-five tracks before settling on the twelve songs that make up  Smoke & Mirrors (many of the rest will be included on a deluxe edition). The record is loosely split between rock tracks meant to capture the feel of seeing Lifehouse live, and extremely catchy, sing-along pop songs. \"That's where the title of the album comes in,\" Jason explains. \"It's about the record being half live and half studio.\" The first single, \"Halfway Gone,\" a collaboration with acclaimed rapper\/songwriter Kevin Rudolf is most definitely in the latter camp. It's an irresistible pop rock song featuring explosive, driving guitars and a chorus that feels instantly familiar. \"Kevin brings another side \u2013 a hint of the hip hop world but in context with what we\u2019re doing,\" Jason says. \"We were fans of his and he was a fan of ours and it just clicked. What resulted was a nice blend of older Lifehouse with a new fresh sound -\u2013 we can't make the same record over and over.\" Lifehouse fans approve of the evolution; \"Halfway Gone\" is already the fastest growing single in the band's history, reaching the top twenty within three weeks of its release. Rudolf also worked on \"Falling In,\" another potential pop hit.  \n\nRudolf was not the only high profile collaboration on Smoke & Mirrors. The band also worked with American Idol alum Chris Daughtry, whom Jason met and became friends with on the road. \"I haven't done much co-writing in the past and I'm a bit leery of it,\" the singer admits. \"You can end up with a song that is not good and just wish you had that day of your life back (laughs) however, I went over to Chris's place in LA and within an hour we had 'Had Enough.'\" The song, to which Daughtry contributes vocals, is a blistering, anthemic example of the kind of music that made Lifehouse fans fall in love with the band in the first place. It belongs alongside the more traditional rock tracks on Smoke & Mirrors like \"Nerve Damage\" and \"Wrecking Ball\" (bassist Soderberg's first lead vocal with the band), songs that capture the unparalleled feel of a Lifehouse show. \n\nThe band will deliver an actual, real live take on these songs very soon \u2013 they hit the road in support of Smoke & Mirrors early next year.  According to Lifehouse, it feels like they're doing this all again for the first time \u2013 they are inspired and excited about getting out there and playing these songs live. \"It's our fifth album but I feel like we're just starting as a band,\" explains Bryce. \"As far as our chemistry goes, we just really know each other now. We know what pisses each other off and how to avoid it. We keep each other level headed, we vent to each other. We leave our egos at the bus door.  We're good to go.\" \n","booking_agent":"CAA","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Los Angeles, CA","description":"www.twitter.com\/lifehouse","general_manager":"Jude Cole","hometown":"Los Angeles, CA","is_published":true,"record_label":"Geffen\/Interscope Records","talking_about_count":18470,"username":"lifehouse","website":"www.lifehousemusic.com http:\/\/www.interscope.com\/lifehouse http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/lifehouse","were_here_count":0,"id":"18222514024","name":"Lifehouse","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lifehouse","likes":3504101,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150714642524025","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/564466_10150714642524025_1478400993_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

A recent graduate of Taylor Allderdice High School, Mac caught the eyes and ears of Rostrum Records, inking a deal in July 2010. A multitalented musician who can play numerous instruments and a young novice of the freestyle\/cipher\/battle circuit of his hometown, Mac has been paving his way to superstardom in his blue-collar hometown for years.\n\nBorn in 1992, Mac taught himself to play piano, drums, guitar, and bass by the age of 6. Then, after learning to compose songs in a variety of musical genres, he began studying the art of rhyme. Influenced by the styles of artists such as Big L, Lauryn Hill, Outkast, and A Tribe Called Quest, Mac soon developed a reputation for delivering jaw-dropping freestyles in Pittsburgh.\n\nRecording his first songs in the Fall of 2007, Mac went on to form a duo called The Ill Spoken. By 2009, Mac began recording solo records. During this time he released \u201cThe Jukebox\u201d and \u201cThe High Life\u201d and began to generate a legitimate buzz in the streets and online.\n\nBy of July 2010, Mac\u2019s buzz became undeniable. With a handful of offers on the table, the young phenom decided to sign with independent powerhouse Rostrum Records. In August 2010, Mac released his Rostrum Records debut \u201cK.I.D.S.\u201d and took the internet and music industry by storm.\n\nThe Source Magazine says \u201cThe sky is the limit for this 19 year old Pittsburgh native,\u201d while HipHopDx labeled Mac as \u201cThe Steel City\u2019s next superstar.\u201d Mac was featured on the cover of XXL Magazine\u2019s coveted Top Freshman in January 2011. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette says \u201cMiller\u2019s skillful rhymes, humorous themes and upbeat demeanor are catching the nation by storm.\u201d Complex Magazine calls Miller \u201cThe Steel City\u2019s newest rap posterboy.\u201d while URB Magazine calls Mac \u201ca young emcee who is the real thing.\u201d Mac\u2019s music is also a mainstay on popular hip-hop sites such as Nahright, 2dopeboyz, Rapradar, TheSmokingSection, Allhiphop, and Illroots.\n\nMac\u2019s greatest strength though could be his ability to shine in front of the camera. Soon after signing to Rostrum, Miller was thrust onto several national radio shows for interviews and impromptu freestyles, which have now become Youtube viral video classics. To coincide with his debut Rostrum free albums \u201cK.I.D.S.\u201d  and \u201cBest Day Ever\u201d Mac continued to team up with hometown filmmaker\/videographer Rex Arrow Films. Mac\u2019s videos have now surpassed 250 million hits on www.youtube.com\/treejtv, including 6 with 15 million plus views a piece.  The success of his early street buzz and social media dominance have now transitioned Mac to sold out shows across the world with The Incredibly Dope Tour upstreaming to the internationally sold out Blue Slide Park Tour with almost 200,000 tickets sold in the past year.\n\nThe year 2011 also showcased Mac\u2019s selling potential as his debut Rostrum EP, \u201cOn and On and Beyond,\u201d sold over 75,000 copies digitally alone. Mac has also sold over 1.5 million singles total with little to no radio airplay.  In November of 2011, Mac continued his surge of success by becoming the first independent artist since 1995 to debut atop the Billboard Charts with \u201cBlue Slide Park.\u201d  As of January 2012, \"Blue Slide Park\" had sold almost 250,000 copies.  Look for Mac Miller to be the new face of music in 2012 and beyond. \n","birthday":"01\/19\/1992","booking_agent":"peterschwartz\u0040theagencygroup.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"The Studio","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Pittsburgh","state":"PA","country":"United States","zip":""},"personal_interests":"Rapping...playing guitar...enjoing scenery and greenery....dreaming...","press_contact":"artie\u0040rostrumrecords.com","record_label":"Rostrum Records","talking_about_count":135847,"username":"macmillerfans","website":"http:\/\/www.macmillerofficial.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"125173346802","name":"Mac Miller","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/macmillerfans","likes":4677996,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151751236041803","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/945616_10151751236041803_1418202439_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

For a band obsessed with interacting with its fans, both online and after shows; for a band that is so concerned with making sure the fan gets the perfect experience, with well-known hijinks in every live performance; for a band with seemingly unlimited creativity in the form of physical products, from custom-made cereal boxes to unique vinyl packaging; and for a band that is so passionate when writing new music, 20 years begins to seem like an even longer amount of time. A lot of moments add up over two decades \u2013 teenagers grow into men over two decades \u2013 dare we say, things change?\nEver-adapting to the constant change in an unsure music industry, Less Than Jake is still making cannonball-sized splashes in the deep end while many of its peers timidly eye shallow waters. With the release of Greetings And Salutations this sentiment is as true as ever. The twelve-track release recorded at The Moathouse in Gainesville and produced by Less Than Jake\u2019s own Roger Lima, includes both limited edition EP\u2019s Season\u2019s Greetings and Greetings From Less Than Jake plus two unreleased songs.\nThe twelve tracks are pure unfiltered LTJ, Sunny ska mixed with barn-burner punk rock, more intended to get long-time fans and first-time listeners warmed up and moshing in their living rooms and singing along to every lyric. Keeping its signature mix of punk roots and horn-driven melodies, songs like \u201cA Return To Headphones\u201d and \u201cFiner Points of Forgiveness\u201d take the best of old-school Less Than Jake and put on a fresh coat of paint for an amped-up listening experience.\nDrummer Vinnie Fiorello puts the release into perspective \u201cWe had been writing music in short creative bursts for the last year but looking back at all the songs they wound up more of a cohesive thought, following the moods of the seasons of the year, from the winter through the summer. Greetings And Salutations is as much moody and tense as it is casual and laid back\u2026\u201d\nGreetings And Salutations is the follow up to 2010\u2019s TV\/EP and the band\u2019s last full-length, 2008\u2019s GNV FLA and is being released in Europe and the UK via Rude Records on October 16th. With the rest of the year of worldwide touring ahead, the group is still following through on its mission to please the fan, wherever the fan may be. More so than many bands that have been doing this for so long, Less Than Jake continues to provide output that loyal fans love. From a 16-minute EP of TV theme show cover songs to re-releases of their classic back catalog to live shows of genre staples Losing Streak or Hello Rockview in their entirety, Less Than Jake has done it all. Less Than Jake will continue to do it all.\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly pushing ourselves to come up with new ways to present the band,\u201d says Schaub, \u201cwhether it be within the writing of our songs, ideas for keeping our live shows fresh, coming up with crazy new merch ideas, or just coming up with the best joke in the van. Keeping your band new and innovative is the key to lasting around for more than a minute in the minds of fans.\u201d\nAs the release of Greetings And Salutations proves, this isn\u2019t a band content to rest on the laurels of past success. In fact, 2012 is more about pushing forward and breaking new ground, rather than contemplatively reflecting on the success of yesteryear. A constantly innovative force in the industry, DeMakes says the band has managed to stay around so long by staying true to themselves. \u201cTwenty years of blood, sweat and beers,\u201d DeMakes says. \u201cIt\u2019s been a privilege and a pleasure. We have survived more trends than we can count and have managed, so far, to leave a legacy of music two decades long.","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"GAINESVILLE ROCK CITY","genre":"ska punk metal","hometown":"GAINESVILLE ROCK CITY","influences":"Descendents, ALL, Iron Maiden, Snuff, Billy Bragg.","is_published":true,"press_contact":"contact press\u0040lessthanjake.com AND vanessa\u0040fatwreck.com","record_label":"SLEEP IT OFF RECORDS","talking_about_count":2532,"username":"lessthanjake","website":"www.lessthanjake.com www.myspace.com\/lessthanjake www.twitter.com\/LessThanJake www.stickam.com\/lessthanjake www.ustream.com\/lessthanjake ","were_here_count":0,"id":"8421631311","name":"Less Than Jake","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lessthanjake","likes":198244,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151617333786312","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/969842_10151617333786312_1896389700_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"www.aventuraworldwide.com - Aventura On INSTAGRAM \u0040AventuraWorldWide - www.twitter.com\/aventura - www.youtube.com\/aventura - www.romeosantosonline.com  www.henrysantos.com","band_members":"Anthony Romeo Santos\nLenny Santos\nMax Agende Santos\nHenry Santos","bio":"AVENTURA BACHATA FOR THE NEW MILLENNIUM\n\nAventura is one of the most unique artists on the scene today.  After well over a decade of sparring in the music business, these four young, dynamic guys with a seldom-seen chemistry continue to auto-produce soulful, original music that gleams with excellence.  Their nouveau sound fuses bachata (a guitar-based Dominican folkloric music sometimes called the \u201cDominican blues\u201d) with R & B, hip hop and other American pop and urban styles.  Lead singer and songwriter Anthony \u201cRomeo\u201d Santos\u2019 original songs are often deep, dealing with social issues.  Even when they tackle timeless themes, such as romance and heartbreak, Romeo\u2019s approach always comes from a different angle.\n\nBecause the Santos boys are so young, it seems incredible that they struggled for eight years before exploding on the scene in the summer of 2002.  Bachata\u2019s conservative base was not accepting of their signature sound; for years the traditional audience either \u201cbooed\u201d them off the stage or refused to acknowledge them.  After all, on a scene dominated by traditionalist stars such as Anthony \u201cEl Mayimbe\u201d Santos and rising romantic minstrels, Zacar\u00edas Ferreira, Aventura\u2019s music was truly radical.\n\nHowever, in summer of 2002, the song \u201cObsesion\u201d hit the airwaves and  \u201cAventura-mania\u201d was born. Loyal fans from the group\u2019s Bronx  neighborhood ran with the innovative sounds of their local band, and the fanaticism soon spread across the tri-state area, into the Northeast and across the country.\n\nIf Aventura fever in the US and Latin America is a phenomena, the band\u2019s impact in Europe has been utterly astounding.  For 16 straight weeks the single \u201cObsesion\u201d charted number 1 in Italy; the album We Broke The Rules topped the charts for months as well. From there Aventura charted number one in Spain, Holland, Belgium, Austria, Greece, Slovenia, Romania among others.  In France, 20 days after release 400,000 singles had been distributed with 139,000 CDs.  In Germany, \u201cObsesion\u201d by Aventura held the number one spot with more than 200,000 CDs sold, while a cover version of \u201cObsesion\u201d by German pop group Third Wish, held the number two position. The song spread through Poland, Russia, Slovakia and Israel, to name a few.  \u201cObsesion\u201d had penetrated the mainstream European market to the point that the \u201cSmurfs\u201d in Germany and Spain have created a parody of the song for inclusion in a future \u201cSmurfs\u201d record release.\n\nIn April, 2005 Aventura released GOD\u2019S PROJECT, its 4th studio production.  It continues to be one of Sony\u2019s most important sellers having sold in excess of 500,000; it remains number one in sales on the Billboard Tropical Chart and in the top ten in Latin Albums; it continues to chart in Billboard General Heatseekers in the top 15.  This album is a successful experiment in blending world cultures, hip hop, R & B and bachata \u2013 it features UN CHI CHI which contains a sample of an Indian pop song performed by the Queen of Bollywood, Asha Bhosle; UN BESO which is flamenco-bachata; Yuly Terrero of Goodfellas Enterprise produced an urban style video for UN BESO as well as for ELLA Y YO a reggaeton-bachata featuring the performances of Don Omar.  Dominican producer great Juan Basanta produced a mini-movie video for the hit single, LA BODA.\n\nOn March 10th, Aventura sold out again \u2013 this time at the Madison Square Garden Theater; the concert was recorded and is yet unreleased. On March 25th the group sold out once again at Altos de Chavon, Dominican Republic, one of the most revered ampitheatres in the hemisphere.  Selections from this landmark event have been released on KOB Live and in the DVD package containing the hit Dominican film, Sanky Panky.\n\nAventura\u2019s fifth album KOB Live (Kings of Bachata) was released on 12\/19\/2006 and has sold 460,000 units as of May, 2008.  The album is an elegant three disc project \u2013 two audio discs (containing 5 new studio songs, the best-of international performances and comedic skits by Aventura\u2019s members) and a video component with excerpts from the sold-out concerts at Madison Square Garden and Altos de Chavon (La Romana, Dominican Republic) as well as the studio video \u201cLos infieles\u201d directed by Jessy Terrero and a pot-pourri of B-roll footage to delight fans).   KOB features a number of industry personalities including Don Omar, a Miri Ben-Ari (The Hip Hop Violinist who has performed with artists such as Alicia Keyes, JayZ and many others) and Luis Jimenez from El Vacilon de la Ma\u00f1ana, to name a few.  The lead single, \u201cLos infieles\u201d hit number one across the country, soon to enjoy similar success in Europe where it debuts on 12\/19 as well. The second single, \u201cMi corazoncito\u201d had a more significant impact; it won multi awards at Premio lo Nuestro, Billboard Latin Awards, Premio La Juventud, Monitor Latino and received an ASCAP Award for Song of the year.  \n\nOn September 1, 2007 Aventura performed at the Madison Square Garden Arena. The show featured a number of guests artists including El Torito, Don Omar, Miri Ben-Ari, Olga Ta\u00f1on, Wisin & Yandel and Anthony Santos \u201cEl Mayimbe.\u201d  The DVD, released on 11\/13\/07, has sold close to 400,000 units, unprecedented for a tropical DVD containing no new material.\n\nIn September, 2008 Aventura performed once again at the Madison Square Garden Arena together with mega-stars Marc Anthony and Alejandro Fernandez and capped off their fall program on a multi-city tour with Enrique Iglesias.  The tickets recently went on sale for Aventura\u2019s long-awaited Puerto Rican December 5th concert at El Coliseo, a 16,000 capacity venue.  Within hours the date was sold out.   Aventura beat the previous record held by the Rolling Stones \u2013 they sold 8,000.  Eventually, the single concert became 5 dates at the Coliseo, all sold out.\n\nOn June 9th, 2009, under the auspices of Premium Latin Music\/Sony BMG, The Last, Aventura\u2019s 5th studio album, debuted at #5 on Billboard 200 and #1 across the board on Latin Charts, selling more than 47,000 units according to Nielsen Soundscan.  The group participated in 10 In Stores across the country \u2013 New York, Miami, Canovanas & San Juan, Puerto Rico, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Bronx, NY, Boston and Washington.  With 3,000 plus fans in attendance at each in store, the tour was a success of historic proportions \u2013 a phenomena.   The Last has dominated the number 1 spot on Billboard during 17 weeks since release. To name just a few landmark accomplishments associated with The Last, on 12\/04 the group was presented with the key to the city in Houston and the fourth of December was made the official \u201cAventura day\u201d by Mayor Bill White.  Aventura headed a toy drive on 12\/22\/09 in New York City in association with the not-for-profit organization Hands On New York where 700 toys were collected and donated.  The Last Tour sold at across the country in stadium venues \u2013 it has had major Billboard write-ups and is listed as one of the most successful live tours of 2009.  Aventura boasts 7 nominations for Premium Lo Nuestro, which award ceremony is slated for February 18, 2010.  Perhaps the height of Aventura\u2019s career, among so many extraordinary accomplishments, was their performance at the White House for Fiesta Latina in October, 2009.   The group members personally met with President Obama.\n\nThe above is characteristic of Aventura\u2019s trajectory where the group has been a consistent award winner.  However, 2008 was unprecedented because Aventura had not released a studio album since God\u2019s Project in 2005.   At Premium lo Nuestro 2008 the group took four awards: Album of the Year (KOB Live), Duo or Group, Song of the Year (\u201cMi corazoncito\u201d), Tropical Artist.  \u201cMi corazoncito\u201d took Song of the Year and Tropical Airplay at the Billboard Awards.  The band has been nominated in four categories for Premio la Juventud 2008: Voice of the Moment, Favorite Concert (KOB Live), Best Tropical Artist, Favorite Ringtone (\u201cUn beso\u201d).\n\nThe members of Aventura are Romeo (lead singer and featured composer), Lenny Santos (musical producer and guitarist), Max \u201cMikey\u201d Santos (bassist and rap artist) and Henry Santos Jeter (singer and composer).\n\nRomeo, lead singer and featured composer, was born on July 21st, 1981 in the Bronx, New York to a Puerto Rican mother and a Dominican father.  At twelve years of age Romeo became a member of the church choir.  Around the same time, he commenced his love affair with Bachata, long before the style became so explosively popular.  A natural songwriter, Anthony\u2019s early compositions were steeped in the tradition of legendary artists such as Blas Duran.  Undoubtedly Romeo\u2019s sweet, soulful voice has played a key role in the group\u2019s success.  However, Romeo\u2019s songwriting is exemplary \u2013 progressive, poetic and down-to-earth; he is a Bronx version of Juan Luis Guerra.  Spinning tales of the tough reality of growing up in the concrete jungle, Anthony\u2019s tunes captivate audiences from all walks of life, young and old.  In 2006, Anthony took an ASCAP award in tropical music for his megahit song \u201cOBSESION\u201d and another yet in the American market in Pop \u2013 the first time a Hispanic writer has won an ASCAP award in the American market.  In 2007, Romeo took the Billboard Composer of the Year Award over such legendary writers as Marco Antonio Solis and Joan Sebastian.  In 2008 he was nominated once again in this prestigious category.  Frankie J\u2019s cover version of \u201cObsesion\u201d was #1 across the country in all markets for 22 weeks; this recording earned Romeo ASCAP awards in Latin and Pop.  He has also penned hits for artists such as Wisin & Yandel (\u201cNoche de sexo\u201d), Thalia (\u201cNo no no\u201d), El Torito (\u201cMe voy\u201d) and Anthony \u201cEl Mayimbe\u201d Santos (\u201cMatame\u201d).\n\nLenny Santos is the group\u2019s guitarist and musical producer\/arranger.  Born in the Bronx, New York on October 24th, 1979 Lenny fell in love with music at age 15.  Like most kids his age, his music of choice was hip hop.  However, with Dominican parents, Bachata was a permanent household staple - the soulful twang of the \u201crequinto\u201d always in the background, day and night.  It was only logical that Lenny would experiment by blending his two favorite musical styles \u2013 bachata and hip hop.  It is Lenny who created unique the Aventura sound; his excellence and creativity as producer are evident from the first bar of any tune on Aventura\u2019s albums.  Lenny\u2019s approach to bachata has been imitated by young, aspiring guitarists, as well as professionals who have added elements of his signature style to their own productions.  Lenny is an active musical producer in his own right, having signed and produced his own group \u201cHuellas de tiempo;\u201d he is also the musical producer for Sony artist \u201cOptima\u201d among others.\n\nMax \u201cMikey\u201d Agende Santos, the band\u2019s bass player, was born in 1982 in the South Bronx.  He started playing at 12 years of age, borrowing a bass at school.  At home he collaborated with his brother Lenny experimenting with rhythms in duo, bass and guitar.  Max was always a rock lover and thus brings elements of rock into Aventura\u2019s sound.  Max is also an excellent rap artist and is featured on the album LOVE & HATE on a track entitled \u201cDon\u2019t Waste My Time\u201d and with Nina Sky on the GOD\u2019S PROJECT track \u201cYou\u2019re Lying.\u201d  Mikey and Lenny have prepared a solo hip hop project and hope to arrange for its release later this year.\n\nHenry Santos Jeter, singer and composer, was born on September 15, 1979 in Moca, Dominican Republic.  As a youngster Henry was already a diehard music fanatic.  He moved with his family to New York at age 14, where he continued to develop his musical skills.  He subsequently joined a band called Los Teenagers with his cousin Anthony, a group which later morphed into Aventura.  Henry is the group\u2019s comedian, delighting the audience with spontaneous antics on stage.  He is also a hard working business person with a myriad of creative projects on the front burner, including an excellent bachata group, The Hustleheartz aka Los Robacorazones.","booking_agent":"Angelo Medina","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Bronx","general_manager":"Johnny Marines","genre":"Latin","hometown":"Bronx","is_published":true,"press_contact":"nanettelamboy\u0040aol.com","record_label":"Premium Latin \/ Sony","release_date":"New Album 2014","talking_about_count":121521,"username":"Aventura","website":"www.aventuraworldwide.com www.twitter.com\/aventura www.youtube.com\/aventura www.myspace.com\/kobkingsofbachata","were_here_count":0,"id":"113762071973246","name":"Aventura","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Aventura","likes":10769733,"cover":{"cover_id":694191330596981,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash4\/s720x720\/999064_694191330596981_16462322_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The official page of Tupac Shakur's estate, committed to his memory. ","bio":"Tupac Amaru Shakur was an inspiration to millions.\n\nWhile he was most famous for his rap career, but was also a gifted actor, poet and a thoughtful while outspoken advocate for the poor and the overlooked in America. During his life, he produced an immense amount of artistic work, which included albums, major Hollywood feature films, and published works. He was most prolific in the music industry, selling over 75 million albums. Tupac\u2019s unapologetic lyrics were relevant, important, and reflective of the hard lives led by many. His music  earned attention and respect through a poetic style that embraced street vocabulary while being innovative and he is still considered by many to be one of the biggest influences on modern hip hop.\n\n\n\nTupac\u2019s career has earned him 6 Grammy nominations and three MTV Video Music Award nominations. Shakur was honoured by the American Music Awards as the Favourite Hiphop Artist in 1997.\n\n\n\nBorn on June 16 1971 in New York City, Shakur\u2019s parents were both members of the Black Panther Party whose militant style and provocative ideologies for civil rights would come to influence Tuapc\u2019s music. At an early age, Tuapc\u2019s love for performance and the arts began to show, as he began acting at age 13 and later enrolled in the Baltimore School of the Arts before dropping out at 17. Shakur broke into the music business with rap group Digital Underground as a back-up dancer and roadie. Eventually Shakur released his first solo album in \u201991, 2pacalypse Now. Now sporting the stage name 2pac, Shakur\u2019s music career began to grow as his second album, Strickly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z included 2 top 20 pop chart tracks: I Get Around and Keep Ya Head Up.\n\n\n\nShakur\u2019s legal battles began after he established his rap career. In the early nineties Shakur faced a wrongful death suit which settled out of court, accusations of assaulting police officers where charges were ultimately dropped, and even an incident where Shakur sustained 5 gunshot wounds from unknown assailants. In 1995 Tupac was sentenced one-and-a-half to four-and-a-half years in prison for sexual assault. However, not even prison could slow the success of Shakur\u2019s career.\n\n\n\nWhile incarcerated  Tupac\u2019s latest album, Me Against the World, was number one in the pop charts and would later go double platinum. Shakur become the first artist to reach number one in the pop chart while serving a prison sentence. Making the most of his time in jail, Tupac became an passionate reader. Among his favourites were the works of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, an italian Renaissance writer whose works were in part the foundation for western political science. Shakur\u2019s appreciation of his work inspired the nickname: Makaveli.\n\n\n\nAfter serving only 8 months of his sentence, Tupac was out on parole thanks to a 1.4 million dollar bond paid by Suge Knight, CEO of Death Row records. Now signed on Death Row records, Shakur went on to create All Eyez on Me, which featured hits How Do You Want It and California Love.\n\n\n\nTupac\u2019s life was cut short in September of 1996 when Shakur became the victim of a drive-by shooting while his car waited on a red light. Inspite surviving the surgery that followed, Shakur was pronounced dead almost a week after the attack.\n\n\n\nEven today, Tupac\u2019s musical influence is wide-spread from the library of congress where his song Dear Mama was added in 2010 to the national registry, to artists like 11 time Grammy winner Eminem who in an interview with MTV said:\n\n\n\n\u201cHe made you feel like you knew him. I think that honestly, Tupac was the greatest songwriter that ever lived. He made it seem so easy. The emotion was there, and feeling, and everything he was trying to describe. You saw a picture that he was trying to paint.\u201d\n\n\n\nTupac leaves a legacy of honestly and passion in his songs. Respected by many, Tupac has become an inspiration for artists and a standard in rap music.","category":"Entertainer","description":"Musician, Actor, Poet, Activist, and Inspiration.

{"about":"Ne-Yo - R.E.D. new album available now. \nGrammy-Award winner!","artists_we_like":"Rihanna, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Mary J. Blige, Ghostface, Jennifer Hudson","bio":"Grammy-Award winner Ne-Yo, who has impressed audiences with his talents since his 2006 with his multi-platinum, chart topping debut, In My Own Words, is fed-up with the sloppiness of current R&B. \"Years ago, if you weren't wearing the right suit or have a correct crease in your pants, you couldn't even get in the door--let alone on stage to perform.\"\n\nWith Ne-Yo's third disc, Year of the Gentleman, the Las Vegas native and premier songwriter has constructed a suite of songs that shows exactly what he means by class.  Written over the course of travels through Europe last year and influenced by his own fascination with the Rat Pack, Ne-Yo explains, \"For me, the sharpness of Sammy and Sinatra is the kind of style I strive for in clothes and music. Year of the Gentleman is named in honor of those guys.\"\n\nLike the best artists, Ne-Yo's music has an eternal sound that appeals to fans of all ages. \"As a songwriter as well as a singer, I think it's important to cast my words wide. In other words, I am not trying to contain myself in some little box marked 'urban.' I have traveled the world, and\nI want to bring that across in the material. Forget about urban, pop or whatever, Year of the Gentleman is a worldly album.\"\n\nIn England, staying at his favorite hotel, the Courthouse, Ne-Yo would sometimes sit at the bar and write songs. \"It's funny, because the hotel used to be a real courthouse,\" he says. \"There was also a small jailhouse in there where supposedly David Bowie and Mick Jagger were both held at one time.\"\n\nNe-Yo proves on the first single \"Closer,\" it is possible to be classy and funky at the same time. Produced by Stargate, the track is an electro-excursion in the glam of Euro-disco. \"I just love the beat on that record,\" says Ne-Yo. \"When I was hanging-out in clubs in London, everything had energy. I wanted to merge that sound with American soul music, and 'Closer' is the end result.\"\n\nHarking back to a late-sixties retro sound, the beautiful \"So You Can Cry\" was one of the first songs Ne-Yo recorded for the project.  Opening with an enchanting guitar resembling soft rain, \"So You Can Cry\" is a heartbreaking tune about a friend mourning a break up.  \"This is a true story,\" explains Ne-Yo.  \"A friend of mine just broke up with her boyfriend and I said, 'Ok, take this moment to be sad.  I'll turn the sun away from you so you can cry today.\"\n\nEmbracing Lennon and McCartney with the same vigor as Marvin Gaye and Michael Jackson, the amazing \"Stop This World\" should be hailed as one of the most beautiful love songs in years. When Ne-Yo swoons, \"She's got heaven in her eyes,\" there is no denying his passion.\n\n\"I don't know what puts certain ideas in my head when I'm writing,\" explains Ne-Yo. \"Sometimes I see a picture in a magazine, a painting in a museum or a word on a page, and that's all I need to trigger the thoughts.\"\n\nIn addition to penning this new collection, Ne-Yo once again showed his writing prowess, penning lyrics for Rihanna, Janet Jackson, Mary J. Blige and Celine Dion as well as the chart topping, record breaking, Grammy nominated song \"Irreplaceable\" for Beyonce.\n\nAs well recording Year of the Gentleman, last year proved to be a very busy time for the young talent. He release his award winning album, toured nationally and made multiple appearances TV appearances including Christmas In Washington making an appearance in front of George Bush but he declined to attend the a meet & greet with the current President.  \n\nMoving beyond the competition by just being himself, Ne-Yo's Year of the Gentleman is right on time to usher in a new era of \"world music.\"","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Atlanta, GA","description":"Ne-Yo - R.E.D. new album available now featuring \"Let Me Love You\" and \"Forever Now\" Biography: Grammy-Award winner ","genre":"R&B\/Soul","hometown":"Las Vegas, NV","influences":"Michael Jackson, Prince, Stevie Wonder, Sammy Davis Jr., The Rat Pack","is_published":true,"record_label":"Motown Records\/ Compound Ent","talking_about_count":98068,"username":"Ne-Yo","website":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ne-Yo","were_here_count":0,"id":"14866607011","name":"Ne-Yo","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ne-Yo","likes":15233850,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151706577952012","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1379347_10151706577952012_2041844905_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

And that's quite alright with me.\" Although the band was inundated with major-label offers after their split with Atlantic, they decided to release under their own Vanity Label imprint, distributed by Sony\/BMGa move that allowed them to make the album they wanted to make.\n\n\"It was great,\" says Ruess, describing the process of recording Dog Problems with producer Steve McDonald (Red Kross). \"I'd go into the studio, make decisions and never have to hear things like, \"I don't know if that has enough octane,\" he continues, laughing. \"I feel like on the last record, we were pressured to make an album full of singles, and this time we could just do whatever we want.\" It's true; six of the songs on Dog Problems have full orchestration (three of which are arranged by Jellyfish mastermind Roger Manning), and while the band may not have felt pressured to write singles, well, nearly every song on the disc could be one.\n\nHowever, the label issues are only part of the story behind Dog Problemsand hearing Ruess explain the album's title is the best way to understand where much of the album's emotional content came from. \"The title Dog Problems comes from the fact that every time my longterm girlfriend and I got back together, we'd get a dog, thinking that it would save our relationship,\" Ruess explains. In fact, you can actually trace Ruess' tumultuous relationship through the songs on the album: \"Matches\" sets the scene and \"I'm Actual\" recounts the events actually going down, while songs toward the end of the disc have a sentimental and almost philosophical bent\"Snails\" in particular, which uses the animal as a metaphor for making the most of the time we have with our loved ones.\n\nBut even if you don't know what each song is about, the medium is also the message. With its horns and complex arrangements, \"Dog Problems\" has the scope of an elaborate show tune; \"Oceans\" is so instantly recognizable that it's difficult to believe you haven't heard it before; and \"She Doesn't Get It,\" features a guitar intro based on Bruce Springsteen's \"Growin' Up,\" but quickly morphs into a hook-filled anthem reminiscent of the band's pop-friendly peers. Ghosts of XTC, Harry Nilsson and, of course, The Beatles haunt the rest of Dog Problems, but the album also takes profound inspiration from Brian Wilson. \"The new album is definitely a pop record; that's the only way I can describe it,\" admits Reuss, clearly referring to a time before Britney Spears and boy bands co-opted the term to sell SUVs.\n\nHowever, despite all this, the most amazing part of The Format's still unfolding story is the way they've survivedno, thrivedin the face of adversity. In the past three years, the band has shared the stage with Motion City Soundtrack, Jimmy Eat World and Dashboard Confessional and kept their fans updated via \"The Living Room\" section of their Web site, where they've posted acoustic versions of Dog Problems songs to tide over their growing legion of listenersand somehow without MTV or radio play, their fanbase has grown exponentially.\n\nSo, how does it feel with the album finally set for release?\n\n\"It's so exciting,\" Ruess beams. \"We were worried that since the record was delayed for a year, maybe people had forgotten about usbut our fanbase has tripled.\" He pauses, trying to articulate three years worth of work into one sentence. \"I don't know how any of this has happened, but I feel like this is just the beginning.\" ","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Phoenix, AZ","hometown":"Phoenix, AZ","is_published":true,"record_label":"The Vanity Label","talking_about_count":125,"username":"theformat","website":"http:\/\/www.theformatmerch.com ","were_here_count":0,"id":"6541352451","name":"The Format","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theformat","likes":148739,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150732356872452","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/545118_10150732356872452_1855542499_n.jpg","offset_y":58,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"LIVE ON RED ROCKS AVAILABLE NOW! http:\/\/bit.ly\/VRiRIP","band_members":"Marc Roberge - singer\/guitarist, Richard On - lead guitarist, Benj Gershman - bassist, Chris Culos - drummer, and Jerry DePizzo - saxophonist","bio":"O.A.R.\u2019s Wind-up Records debut album, King, marks a new beginning for the band, while also paying homage to their past. It is the seventh studio effort in a career that began with their high school recording, The Wanderer. Bringing back the title character from their first album, O.A.R. takes the listener on a journey to discover that what the Wanderer, and the band members themselves, had been searching for all along, was there from the beginning. As the closing song on the new disc states, a return \u201cBack to One.\u201d\n\nKing is O.A.R.\u2019s follow-up to their 2008 studio album All Sides, which debuted at #13 on the Billboard Top 200 and #3 on the Digital Album chart. The album provided many firsts for the band including their first Certified Platinum single \u201cShattered,\u201d which in 2009 was the #6 best-selling Rock Song at iTunes and earned them an ASCAP Award as one of the Most Performed Pop Songs of the Year. With All Sides, the band\u2019s cumulative album sales reached close to 2 million and they received the honor of being on Performing Songwriter's list of the 100 Most Influential Independent Artists of the Past 15 Years. The release was the culmination of years of hard work creating music, traveling the country and performing for their legions of fans.\n\nTo begin work on King, the band embarked on a journey to each band member\u2019s hometown. The first stop was at The Metro in Chicago, home to drummer Chris Culos. \u201cThe music was coming together very naturally, helped by the vibe of being in a real venue versus a stale rehearsal room. It was a perfect way for the recording process to originate from a \u2018live\u2019 place,\u201d says Chris. From there the band moved on to Columbus, OH\u2019s (Jerry DePizzo) brand-new 1305 complex; Washington, DC\u2019s (Richard On) legendary punk studio Inner Ear; and New York\u2019s (Benj Gershman and Marc Roberge) historic Avatar Studios. Like The Wanderer completing his odyssey back to where he started, the band members returned home for inspiration and to prepare for their next adventure.\n\n \u201cWhen I first started writing songs I was young and hadn\u2019t experienced many things, so I chose to write from the perspective of someone else, the Wanderer,\u201d notes Marc Roberge. \u201cNow, after having traveled throughout the country, gotten married and having a child of my own, I felt like it was time to bring the Wanderer back and complete his journey.\u201d\n\nAs the concept for the album was taking shape and the songs were nearing completion, lead singer Marc Roberge was blindsided with news that his wife had cancer and a tumor needed to be removed immediately.  After putting everything on hold, the band eventually resumed recording, but this time with a new appreciation of what they had and a resolve to inspire others to be true to themselves and to find their own King within.\n\n \u201cWe already had the theme for the record planned, but we never knew how much the message would resonate with each of us, and that we would be confronted by how fragile life can be. The idea of appreciating what you have and enjoying your life has always been a message in our music, but it never hit so close to home,\u201d says Richard.\n\nSongs like \u201cTaking on the World Today,\u201d \u201cThe Last Time,\u201d \u201cGotta Live\u201d and the stark piano ballad \u201cOver and Over,\u201d began to take on new meaning. Inspired by producers Matt Wallace (Maroon 5, Blues Traveler, Paul Westerberg) and Gregg Wattenberg (Train, Five for Fighting), O.A.R. began to hone in on the emotional essence of the songs, blending their more traditional reggae roots with new musical elements they had picked up over their fifteen years performing together. The new tracks contain moments of uplift (\u201cGotta Be Wrong Sometimes\u201d), shimmering guitars (\u201cThe Last Time\u201d), world beat (\u201cGotta Live\u201d), populist fervor (\u201cFire,\u201d \u201cDangerous Connection\u201d), narrative prowess (\u201cAlmost Easy\u201d) and even hip-hop (which you can hear in the various connecting interludes as well as the DJ Logic samples, and the excerpt from a speech by rap entrepreneur Russell Simmons on the title track).\n\nThe first single \u201cHeaven,\u201d which was the last song to be written, served as the centerpiece for the album\u2019s central theme.   \n\n\u201cHaving just gone through the hardest year of my life, I had a clear understanding of how good it is to be here, to be who you are. I feel like we spend so much time worrying about where we are going to end up that we completely ignore the world that surrounds us every day. I was tired of doing that. \u2018Heaven\u2019 is about living on your own terms and being yourself,\u201d says Marc.\n \u201cThis record really tells the story of our journey,\u201d adds guitarist Richard On. \u201cIt has led us back to what inspired us to write songs in the first place - the story of The Wanderer. However, this time, we had the added benefit of experience which made us better musicians and songwriters.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though there were many ups and downs during the making of this album, we ended up with what we had all hoped for\u2014an album where the individual pieces work together and tell a broader story,\u201d notes Marc.\nAnd now O.A.R. is ready to get back to what they do best\u2014playing live for their faithful fans.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such a great feeling in the band now,\u201d adds Richard. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited to get the new music out to all the fans who have been so supportive of us over the years and who have been patiently waiting for this new album. We can\u2019t wait to get out on the road and perform the new material.\"  \n\nFor O.A.R., the most difficult of times is about to give way to the best of times.\n\nThe Wanderer is back\u2026 Long live the King.\n","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"Rockville, MD","is_published":true,"record_label":"Everfine Records","talking_about_count":704,"username":"ofarevolution","website":"www.ofarevolution.com www.myspace.com\/ofarevolution www.liveoar.com www.twitter.com\/ofarevolution ","were_here_count":0,"id":"5957957772","name":"O.A.R.","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ofarevolution","likes":465693,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151187484482773","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/563622_10151187484482773_502676082_n.jpg","offset_y":94,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"aqu\u00ed, ahora, adelante!","band_members":"Kazz, Gas\u00fa, Cassab, Charlie Quezada\n","bio":" 1987 fue el a\u00f1o en que M\u00e9xico vivi\u00f3 el nacimiento de un movimiento cultural que ven\u00eda gest\u00e1ndose a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s\u2026 un movimiento que marc\u00f3 a una generaci\u00f3n y que a\u00fan es referencia para los amantes de la m\u00fasica\u2026\n\n  Nacidos por la simple necesidad de expresar sue\u00f1os y vivencias a trav\u00e9s de la m\u00fasica, los amantes de Lola surgen dentro del movimiento que posteriormente se conocer\u00eda como Rock en tu idioma, junto con bandas como Caifanes, Ne\u00f3n, Maldita Vecindad, Fobia, Bon y los Enemigos del Silencio.\n\n  1988 fue el a\u00f1o en que el profesionalismo de las bandas qued\u00f3 demostrado al conseguir que los medios masivos de comunicaci\u00f3n voltearan a ver al Rock como un movimiento serio, e incluso lucrativo.  Espacios radiof\u00f3nicos y de television fueron abriendo sus puertas para las bandas de Rock.\n\nEn 1989  bandas espa\u00f1olas y sudamericanas comienzan a visitar el pa\u00eds y a hacerse presentes en el gusto de todos.  La Uni\u00f3n, Radio Futura, Hombres G, Mecano, El \u00faltimo de la Fila, Los Toreros Muertos, La orquesta Mondrag\u00f3n, Soda St\u00e9reo, Miguel Mateos, Charlie Garc\u00eda y Fito P\u00e1ez por nombrar a algunos ofrecen conciertos y son programados en estaciones que, hasta entonces, solo programaban m\u00fasica\u201dpop\u201d. Ir\u00f3nicamente, el Rock comenzaba a ser m\u00e1s Pop que el \u201cpop\u201d.\n\n\n  1990  fue el a\u00f1o del lanzamiento del primer disco de la banda, titulado simplemente \u201clos amantes de Lola\u201d, disco  que tuvo una gran aceptaci\u00f3n y del cual se desprenden canciones como  \u201cla flor de Bagdad\u201d, \u201cMar\u00eda Rosario\u201d, \u201cDon Juan\u201d, \u201cla Do\u00f1a\u201d y el primer sencillo: \u201cMam\u00e1\u201d.  \n\n Junto con la salida del disco, la banda recorri\u00f3 exitosamente casi todo el pa\u00eds, colocando sencillos en numerosas ciudades de la rep\u00fablica y logrando traspasar las fronteras, de manera informal, pero efectiva. Para entonces, el movimiento de Rock en tu idioma tomaba dimensiones inimaginadas y la aceptaci\u00f3n de la gente era indiscutible. \nEse mismo a\u00f1o, los amantes de Lola comparten escenario con la banda australiana INXS en el Palacio de los Deportes de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico, durante 3 d\u00edas consecutivos, marcando el regreso de los conciertos masivos de Rock a la capital del pa\u00eds , quitando los estigmas que hasta entonces hab\u00eda sobre las bandas de Rock. \nSe hacen presentes en el gusto de la gente bandas como Caf\u00e9 Tacvba, Santa Sabina y Cuca, entre otras, y bandas que ya ten\u00edan una larga trayectoria se vuelven cada vez m\u00e1s conocidas, entre ellas Ritmo Peligroso, Rostros Ocultos, Man\u00e1, Kenny y los El\u00e9ctricos. Incluso, el Tri y muchas otras bandas urbanas consolidan el movimiento. \n   1991 es el a\u00f1o en que los amantes de Lola presentan su segunda producci\u00f3n: \u201cla era del Terror\u201d, disco impregnado de un estilo muy definido y del cual se di\u00f3 a conocer principalmente el sencillo \u201cbeber de tu sangre\u201d, con el cual, la banda se da a conocer en gran parte de latinoam\u00e9rica y en el mercado latino de Estados Unidos. M\u00e1s de 100 conciertos en ese a\u00f1o respaldan la solidez de la banda.\n\n  1992  fue el a\u00f1o que vivi\u00f3 el declive del mercado del disco en M\u00e9xico. La excesiva ambici\u00f3n de las disqueras llev\u00f3 a que el movimiento se explotara en forma desmedida, y para 1993 las companies hab\u00edan sangrado al Rock brutalmente, siendo las bandas quienes pagar\u00edan el precio al verse exigidas vorazmente y poco respaldadas para proyectarse en los cada vez m\u00e1s ambiciosos medios masivos de comunicaci\u00f3n.  Fue necesario entrar en un estado latente en los a\u00f1os subsecuentes, donde la necesidad de cultivar el esp\u00edritu y recuperar la perspectiva acerca de nuestras vidas nos pareci\u00f3 m\u00e1s importante que cumplir con los caprichos del mercado.\n  \nA pesar de algunas presentaciones ocasionales, fue hasta 1998 donde un concierto en el teatro Metrop\u00f3litan de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico marc\u00f3 el probable regreso de la banda a los escenarios. En el a\u00f1o 2000, junto con la salida del disco de Kazz, titulado \u201cel tunel del tiempo\u201d,  la banda se reune para replantear los principios que alguna vez nos hab\u00edan unido. \n  A partir de 2001 comienza una etapa de compromiso con la m\u00fasica y no con las necesidades del mercado. Curiosamente, los amantes de Lola comienzan a dar conciertos por toda la rep\u00fablica mexicana, alternando con grupos de la \u201cvieja guardia\u201d y con grupos del nuevo movimiento independiente. \n  Para el 2003, las presentaciones por toda la rep\u00fablica continuaron y se extendieron al sur de Estados Unidos.\n  \n  En el 2004  los amantes de Lola participan en el festival \u201cVive Latino\u201d donde, a pesar de la temprana hora de la presentaci\u00f3n, tuvieron a m\u00e1s de 18 mil personas coreando sus cl\u00e1sicos. A mediados de a\u00f1o regresan a Estados Unidos y se presentan junto a Jaguares en Kansas City. Posteriormente presentan exitosamente en el Hard Rock Live de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico su tercera producci\u00f3n, titulada simplemente \u201c3\u201d, de donde se dan a conocer temas como \u201cdescubr\u00ed\u201d y \u201cla mitad del tiempo\u201d.  \n\n  Durante 2005 y 2006, la banda  continua present\u00e1ndose por todo M\u00e9xico. De regreso en  Estados Unidos visitaron ciudades como Chicago, Houston, El Paso y otras m\u00e1s.\n  En Agosto, una vez m\u00e1s en el Hard Rock Live de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico,  con un lleno total, lanzan su cuarta producci\u00f3n: \u201cHistorias de Cabaret\u201d   disco totalmente en vivo, grabado en Marzo en el teatro \u201c el Batacl\u00e1n\u201d.\n\n  En 2007, fueron invitados a participar en el encuentro \u201cFusi\u00f3n\u201d de Oye FM, donde se les entreg\u00f3 un reconocimiento por la trayectoria y la permancencia en el gusto de sus radioescuchas. Los conciertos contin\u00faan, destacando el concierto \u201cViviendo Rock\u201d en el Toreo de Cuatro Caminos, frente a 5 mil personas, junto a Miguel Mateos, Rostros Ocultos y Kenny.\n  \n  2008 fue un a\u00f1o de trabajo personal intenso. Hoy, satisfechos con la trayectoria y congruentes con cada uno, Kazz y Gas\u00fa,  los amantes de Lola contin\u00faan con el amor a la m\u00fasica como premisa para seguir creando.   \n\n","booking_agent":"info\u0040losamantesdelola.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"M\u00e9xico","genre":"rock en espa\u00f1ol","hometown":"Mexico","is_published":true,"press_contact":"info\u0040losamantesdelola.com","record_label":"indie","release_date":"1987","talking_about_count":5306,"username":"losamantesdelola","website":"www.losamantesdelola.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"28635682619","name":"los amantes de Lola","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/losamantesdelola","likes":52889,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151724695292620","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1017391_10151724695292620_95966610_n.jpg","offset_y":17,"offset_x":0}}

Cole (born Jermaine Cole) is a refreshing exception to the quick route for fame and success.  The first artist signed to Jay-Z\u2019s new Roc Nation label, Cole made himself notable through a scholarly approach to the game \u2013 no small feat considering his Magna Cum Laude distinction upon graduating from St. John\u2019s University.  \n \nIf his sudden christening by JAY-Z shocked the haters, their doubts were quickly refuted when J. Cole dropped his recent mixtape The Warm Up, as well as a coveted guest verse on JAY-Z\u2019s Blueprint 3 with \u201cA Star is Born\u201d.  Soulful and strong, J. Cole\u2019s lyrics touch on everything from his upbringing in North Carolina to the poverty and hopelessness that affect his community. The mixtape encapsulates not just who J. Cole is as a rapper, but who he is as an artist and a person.  \n \nTaking from his favorite artists a love for powerful storytelling with an intense inner-strength, J. Cole advanced to writing his own lyrics at 15, soon amassing stacks of notebooks filled with rhymes and observations.  Without a DJ or producer to provide a beat, he industriously started creating his own using a beat machine given as a present by his mother.  From then on J.

En 1975 decidieron juntarse para tocar distintos temas de grupos a los que admiraban, entre ellos The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, The Police, entre otros. \nInicialmente, se hac\u00edan llamar The Spies of the Green Hat, pero pronto el nombre se abrevi\u00f3 a Green Hat y, finalmente, se adapt\u00f3 al espa\u00f1ol como Sombrero Verde, ya que la banda deseaba tocar rock en su propio idioma, siendo de los primeros grupos en aventurarse a componer sus propias canciones aun cuando el rock en espa\u00f1ol no era una tendencia. \nEn 1981 publicaron su primer disco, Sombrero Verde, con el sello Ariola; los sencillos fueron \"Vampiro\", \"Profesor\", \"Long time\" y \"Despi\u00e9rtate\".\n \nEn 1983 lanzaron A Tiempo de Rock; los sencillos del \u00e1lbum ser\u00edan \"Laura\", \"Hechos nada m\u00e1s\" y \"Me voy al mar\". Con esta producci\u00f3n el grupo logr\u00f3 escaso \u00e9xito. \n\nEn 1984, Abraham Calleros, baterista del grupo, decide dejar la banda para continuar su carrera musical en Estados Unidos. El grupo decide poner un anuncio en el peri\u00f3dico solicitando un nuevo integrante, gracias a esto encuentran al joven baterista de origen cubano-colombiano nacido en Miami, Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, quien a partir de ese momento ser\u00eda pieza clave de la historia del grupo. \nLa vida de Sombrero Verde continu\u00f3 hasta 1986, cuando el guitarrista Gustavo Orozco decide tambi\u00e9n abandonar la agrupaci\u00f3n concentrarse en sus estudios acad\u00e9micos. Al quedar de nuevo el grupo como cuarteto, Fher decide cerrar el libro de Sombrero Verde y formar una nueva banda que fusionara el rock, pop y los ritmos latinos.\n \nEn esa \u00e9poca, comenz\u00f3 en M\u00e9xico el movimiento denominado \"Rock en tu idioma\", una estrategia comercial de algunas compa\u00f1\u00edas discogr\u00e1ficas encaminada a llamar la atenci\u00f3n de los j\u00f3venes para desarrollar m\u00fasica rock en espa\u00f1ol. La tendencia, importada de Argentina y Espa\u00f1a, estaba avalada por el trabajo pionero de grupos como Soda Stereo, Enanitos Verdes, Mecano, Nacha Pop, La Uni\u00f3n, Radio Futura, Hombres G y Zas (La banda de Miguel Mateos); como consecuencia de ello, aparecieron varias bandas mexicanas formadas por j\u00f3venes con influencias musicales de grupos norteamericanos y europeos. Surgieron as\u00ed las bandas l\u00edderes del movimiento en M\u00e9xico: Caifanes, Maldita Vecindad, Caf\u00e9 Tacvba y, entre ellas, Man\u00e1, quienes lograr\u00edan \u00e9xito no solo a nivel local sino tambi\u00e9n internacionalmente.\n\nMan\u00e1\n\nEn medio de este naciente movimiento, la banda adopt\u00f3 el nombre que le dar\u00eda proyecci\u00f3n internacional: \u00abMan\u00e1\u00bb, que fue elegido por el significado que tiene la palabra en polinesio: \u00abenerg\u00eda positiva\u00bb. La alineaci\u00f3n qued\u00f3 conformada por Fher Olvera como vocalista, los hermanos Ulises y Ju\u00e1n Diego Calleros, en guitarra y bajo respectivamente, y Alex Gonz\u00e1lez en la bater\u00eda.  \n \nEn 1987, el grupo firm\u00f3 con la discogr\u00e1fica Polygram y public\u00f3 Man\u00e1, disco que afianzar\u00eda el movimiento Rock en tu idioma. De este trabajo se desprendieron los sencillos: \u201cRobot\u201d, \u201cMentirosa\u201d, \u201cMueve tus caderas\u201d y \u201cQueremos paz\u201d. Con esta producci\u00f3n el grupo tuvo escaso \u00e9xito, y no dej\u00f3 del todo satisfechos a los integrantes; diversos roces con la disquera por el deseo de mantener la esencia e identidad del grupo, llevaron a Man\u00e1 a pedir su carta de retiro de Polygram. \n \n\nFalta Amor \n\nCon un futuro incierto el grupo trabaja en nuevos demos y busca una nueva compa\u00f1\u00eda discogr\u00e1fica, logrando firmar con Warner Music M\u00e9xico. \nTras la mala experiencia del primer disco, Fher y Alex estaban concientes de los riesgos que implica ponerse en las manos de un productor que no entend\u00eda el concepto del grupo ni su propuesta art\u00edstica, por lo que optaron por iniciarse en un camino del cual no se han apartado desde entonces: asumir ellos la producci\u00f3n de todos sus discos. \n\nCon esa idea en mente graban el \u00e1lbum Falta Amor (1989), que no obtiene \u00e9xito sino hasta un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s de su lanzamiento gracias al sencillo \u201cRayando el sol\u201d, el cual se convierte en el primer gran \u00e9xito para Man\u00e1; los sencillos \u201cPerdido en un barco\u201d, \u201cEstoy agotado\u201d y \u201cBusc\u00e1ndola\u201d llegan tambi\u00e9n al gusto de la gente. \n \nEl grupo realiza 112 presentaciones en M\u00e9xico y su primer concierto multitudinario fuera de las fronteras de su pa\u00eds, en el Coliseo General Rumi\u00f1ahui de Quito, Ecuador. Fue gracias a esta presentaci\u00f3n que el grupo se dio cuenta del potencial que la banda pod\u00eda tener a nivel internacional. \n \n \n\u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os?\n\nEn 1991 Man\u00e1 enfrenta el primer cambio en su alineaci\u00f3n con la salida de Ulises Calleros, quien desde entonces se dedica a representar al grupo. Ello signific\u00f3 la llegada de dos nuevos miembros: el tecladista Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez y el guitarrista C\u00e9sar \u201cEl Vampiro\u201d L\u00f3pez. Con esa nueva formaci\u00f3n graban en Los \u00c1ngeles en el a\u00f1o 1992 \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os?, \u00e1lbum que constituye un aut\u00e9ntico parteaguas en la historia del grupo y en la del rock en espa\u00f1ol, manteni\u00e9ndose durante 97 semanas en la lista Billboard de los discos m\u00e1s vendidos de Latinoam\u00e9rica. \n  \nOcho sencillos de esta producci\u00f3n encabezaron las listas de popularidad en toda la Am\u00e9rica hispanoparlante y se han convertido en temas cl\u00e1sicos de su repertorio: \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d, \u201c\u00bfD\u00f3nde jugar\u00e1n los ni\u00f1os?\u201d, \u201cDe pies a cabeza\u201d, \u201cComo te deseo\u201d, \u201cOye mi amor\u201d, \u201cC\u00f3mo diablos\u201d, \u201cTe llor\u00e9 un r\u00edo\u201d y \u201cMe vale\u201d. \n \nLa globalizaci\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 inicia en 1993, con una maquinaria promocional de primer nivel y una serie de 268 conciertos en m\u00e1s de 17 pa\u00edses. La gira fue un \u00e9xito y posicion\u00f3 a la banda entre la comunidad latina de Estados Unidos y en mercados como Chile, Ecuador, Per\u00fa, Bolivia, Venezuela y Argentina. \n \nArgentina y Espa\u00f1a, dos territorios hist\u00f3ricamente dif\u00edciles de alcanzar para artistas latinos no nativos, fueron tambi\u00e9n conquistados por el fen\u00f3meno de Man\u00e1 gracias a que el tema \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d alcanz\u00f3 el primer lugar en las listas de popularidad de ambos pa\u00edses, lo cual no hab\u00eda sucedido en 26 a\u00f1os. Este mismo tema se hace merecedor al premio MTV Latino Video Music Award como mejor video del a\u00f1o. \n \nEn Abril de 1994 y por diferencias art\u00edsticas y profesionales, Iv\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez y C\u00e9sar \u201cEl Vampiro\u201d L\u00f3pez dejan Man\u00e1 a la mitad de la gira. Por un segundo, el futuro de la banda y su tour estuvo en duda, pero pronto demostraron que la formula de la agrupaci\u00f3n y su esencia segu\u00eda intacta. Para acabar la gira contrataron a los m\u00fasicos Ju\u00e1n Carlos Toribio como apoyo en teclados, Gustavo Orozco en guitarra y Sheila R\u00edos en coros. \n\n \nMan\u00e1 en Vivo\n\nCon su nuevo y bien merecido estatus en la escena del rock pop latino internacional, el tr\u00edo compuesto por Fher, Alex y Ju\u00e1n lanzaron el disco Man\u00e1 en Vivo (1994). La idea de lanzar un disco de sus conciertos surge como un medio para capturar la energ\u00eda y revivir cada momento, cada gota de adrenalina y sudor que forman parte de la magia de las presentaciones de Mana. \nEl disco fue grabado entre Agosto y Septiembre de 1994, durante las presentaciones del grupo en el Universal Amphitheatre de Los \u00c1ngeles, la Sports Arena en San Diego, el Aragon Theatre en Chicago, el Teatro Gran Rex en Buenos Aires, el Estadio de Chile en Santiago y la Sala Est\u00e1ndar en Barcelona.\nUna vez m\u00e1s, la revista Billboard los galardon\u00f3 con el premio al mejor \u00c1lbum Rock\/Pop del A\u00f1o. \n\nCuando Los \u00c1ngeles Lloran \n\nDeseosos de regresar a su formaci\u00f3n original como cuarteto, Man\u00e1 tiene el tercer y \u00faltimo cambio en su alineaci\u00f3n. La banda audiciona a m\u00e1s de 80 guitarristas de M\u00e9xico, Argentina, Chile y Estados Unidos, hasta que finalmente en Aguascalientes, M\u00e9xico, encuentran al talento que buscaban en Sergio Vall\u00edn, cuya sorprendente sensibilidad, t\u00e9cnica y versatilidad vienen a darle un lustre distinto al sonido de las guitarras en las producciones de la banda. Con esa nueva formaci\u00f3n  y con demos hechos en Guadalajara y Puerto Vallarta, graban y editan el disco Cuando los \u00c1ngeles Lloran (1995) entre Los \u00c1ngeles y el puerto jalisciense. Esta producci\u00f3n, lanzada tres a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su exitoso \u00bfD\u00f3nde Jugar\u00e1n Los Ni\u00f1os? se distingue por una notable evoluci\u00f3n en la l\u00edrica y el sonido del grupo. Los sencillos \u201cD\u00e9jame entrar\u201d, \u201cNo ha parado de llover\u201d y \u201cHundido en un rinc\u00f3n\u201d no solo representaron un rotundo \u00e9xito en la radio, sino que los videos correspondientes tuvieron una gran rotaci\u00f3n en los canales de m\u00fasica y ganaron diversos premios por su calidad. \n \nEl disco les permiti\u00f3 una primera nominaci\u00f3n al premio Grammy Americano, el m\u00e1s importante en la industria discogr\u00e1fica.\n \nCon el estandarte de un nuevo disco el grupo inicia su nueva gira el 12 de mayo de 1995, con un total de 52 conciertos realizados en 13 pa\u00edses, esto en un per\u00edodo de menos de cinco meses, lo cual mostr\u00f3 el fen\u00f3meno que para ese momento ya significaba Man\u00e1.\n\nDurante su visita a Espa\u00f1a en ese mismo a\u00f1o, el grupo se present\u00f3 en la plaza de Las Ventas junto a Revolver y La Uni\u00f3n, donde el p\u00fablico recibi\u00f3 a la banda con los brazos abiertos. La gira Cu\u00e1ndo Los \u00c1ngeles Lloran signific\u00f3 al grupo presentaciones con sold out completos en cada plaza que visitaban.  \n\nOtros impresionantes logros fueron la inclusi\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 en el festival de Jazz de Montreaux y la conferencia Midem, que tuvieron lugar en Suiza y Francia, respectivamente, una proeza nunca antes alcanzada. Tambi\u00e9n participan con un tema en la pel\u00edcula My Family, a petici\u00f3n del prestigiado director Francis Ford Coppola. \nMan\u00e1 siempre ha expresado su inter\u00e9s en los problemas que el planeta est\u00e1 enfrentando en materia de ecolog\u00eda, por lo que en Septiembre de 1995 crearon la Fundaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica Selva Negra, con el objetivo de crear conciencia sobre el tema. (www.selvanegra.org.mx)\n \nA mediados de Abril de 1996, el grupo continu\u00f3 una extensa y esperada gira por toda la Rep\u00fablica Mexicana.\n \nDurante la segunda mitad de 1996 la banda se aventur\u00f3 en una gira de 17 conciertos con localidades agotadas en Boston, San Diego, Washington DC, Santa Barbara, New York, Atlanta, Chicago, New Orle\u00e1ns, Sacramento, Miami, San Jose, Phoenix, San Bernardino, Tucson, Anaheim y las Vegas. Dicho tour les vali\u00f3 importantes art\u00edculos en prestigiosas revistas como Rolling Stone, Time, Details, People Magazine, Newsweek y Pollstar. \n \nEl 7 de Septiembre de 1996 la banda se presenta dos noches con localidades agotadas en el James Knight Center de Miami, logro nunca antes alcanzado por una banda de rock pop latina. La producci\u00f3n le vali\u00f3 al grupo el premio Billboard al Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock\/Pop Latino, lo cual fijo un record de 6 premios Billboard recibidos en un per\u00edodo de 3 a\u00f1os. \n \nDespu\u00e9s de sus presentaciones en Estados Unidos la banda regresa a M\u00e9xico, donde dan 2 exitosos conciertos  en la Plaza de Toros de su natal Guadalajara. Durante su estad\u00eda en dicha ciudad, la banda dio una conferencia de prensa para anunciar el lanzamiento de su website; mientras la conferencia ten\u00eda lugar el sitio recibi\u00f3 6000 entradas, una cifra sorprendente tomando en cuenta la \u00e9poca.\n \nEn Marzo de 1997 la reconocida revista americana especializada en bateristas y la industria de este instrumento, Modern Drummer, public\u00f3 un art\u00edculo sobre Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, en la cual se\u00f1ala a Man\u00e1 como todo un suceso dentro del rock pop latino en Estados Unidos, a la par de reconocer a Alex como uno de los mejores bateristas a nivel mundial dentro del g\u00e9nero. 11 a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s, en Marzo de 2008 Alex aparece de nuevo en la revista, pero esta vez en una extensa entrevista.\n \nSue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos\n\nTras una favorable experiencia de su anterior grabaci\u00f3n en Puerto Vallarta, sitio important\u00edsimo en el atlas creativo de Man\u00e1, el grupo decide regresar para hacer los demos y la grabaci\u00f3n de su pr\u00f3xima producci\u00f3n. As\u00ed, con la ambici\u00f3n de crear m\u00fasica en un ambiente donde el agua, elemento vital como pocos, tuviera una presencia contundente, Man\u00e1 renta una hermosa casa con vista a Bah\u00eda de Banderas, en Conchas Chinas, y graban el disco Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos en 1997. \nIncontables atardeceres frente al oc\u00e9ano fueron el marco id\u00f3neo para concebir  Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, \u00e1lbum producido tambi\u00e9n por Fher y Alex, en colaboraci\u00f3n con Benny Faccone. El resultado fue una energ\u00e9tica mezcla de rock, pop y ritmos latinos que van desde el bosanova hasta el flamenco, pasando por la cadencia caribe\u00f1a del reggae. Importantes sencillos como \u201cEn el Muelle de San Bl\u00e1s\u201d, \u201cHechicera\u201d, \u201cClavado en un bar\u201d y \u201cComo dueles en los labios\u201d se desprenden de esta producci\u00f3n.\n \nEl disco sali\u00f3 al mercado en Octubre de 1997 y fue lanzado simult\u00e1neamente en 36 pa\u00edses; debut\u00f3 en primer lugar en el Billboard Hot Latin 50 Chart.\n\nLa producci\u00f3n son\u00f3 fuerte tambi\u00e9n en la Uni\u00f3n Americana y Man\u00e1 se convirti\u00f3 en la primera banda de rock en espa\u00f1ol que se present\u00f3 en El Show de Kathie Lee & Regis, emisi\u00f3n l\u00edder de audiencia en la televisi\u00f3n estadounidense. \n \nEl 30 de  Enero de 1998 la banda inici\u00f3 su gira m\u00e1s ambiciosa, Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos World Tour en Chile, para posteriormente visitar Uruguay y M\u00e9xico. Tras una pausa de 4 semanas debido a que el baterista, Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, fue diagnosticado con hepatitis A, el grupo reanud\u00f3 la gira por su natal M\u00e9xico, donde ofrecieron 44 conciertos.\n\nEntre las presentaciones que destacan en la gira Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos Tour 98 se encuentran las de Bolivia, Colombia, Per\u00fa, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Chile, Puerto Rico, Honduras, y El Salvador.  \n\nOtras de las presentaciones m\u00e1s importantes son los conciertos en el Auditorio Nacional, recinto en el que Man\u00e1 rompi\u00f3 r\u00e9cord, pues fue la primera ocasi\u00f3n en que una banda de este g\u00e9nero se presenta siete veces consecutivas sobre este escenario.\n\nDe vital importancia para la carrera de Man\u00e1 fue ser la primera banda de rock en espa\u00f1ol firmada por la agencia Creative Artist Agency (CAA), con ello Man\u00e1 se un\u00eda a la importante lista de representados que inclu\u00eda a Bon Jovi, AC\/DC, Alanis Morissette, Eric Clapton, Madonna, Depeche Mode, Santana, Bob Dylan, George Michael, entre otros.\n \nSu primer gira de la mano con CAA inici\u00f3 el 21 de agosto de 1998 en Los \u00c1ngeles, CA y cubri\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 30 ciudades con un total de 36 shows en arenas y anfiteatros, la mayor\u00eda de ellas con llenos totales. Importantes presentaciones tuvieron lugar en el Universal Amphitheatre de Los \u00c1ngeles y en el Rosemont Horizon Arena, donde rompen record al ser el primer grupo de rock pop latino en agotar localidades. \n \nEste tour fue el m\u00e1s grande realizado por un grupo de rock pop latino en Estados Unidos.\n \nLa banda es nominada por sexta vez consecutiva a los premios que otorga la revista Billboard por Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, dentro del rubro Mejor \u00c1lbum Pop Rock del A\u00f1o, llev\u00e1ndose el cotizado premio.\n \nEn diciembre de 1998, Man\u00e1 fue nominado por segunda vez  a los Premios Grammy Americanos en la categor\u00eda Mejor \u00c1lbum Latino de Rock\/Alternativo por Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos, premio al que se hicieron merecedores el 24 de febrero de 1999. Este es el primer Grammy otorgado a una banda de rock pop mexicana.\n \nTambi\u00e9n en diciembre de 1998, Fher recibe una invitaci\u00f3n por parte de Carlos Santana para participar en su nuevo material discogr\u00e1fico. Fher compone \u00a8Coraz\u00f3n espinado\u00a8, tema con el cual se abren fronteras para la m\u00fasica latina, tras colocarse este sencillo en los primeros lugares de pa\u00edses europeos, asi\u00e1ticos, y americanos. La grabaci\u00f3n se realiz\u00f3 en las ciudades de Los \u00c1ngeles y San Francisco CA, en donde naci\u00f3 una gran amistad entre ambos m\u00fasicos.\n \nComo resultado de esta colaboraci\u00f3n, Alex y Fher reciben el premio Grammy como productores y escritores de dicha canci\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de realizar junto a Santana una gira por Estados Unidos y M\u00e9xico. El grupo comparti\u00f3 arenas, auditorios y estadios de la Uni\u00f3n Americana con Carlos Santana, en una extensa gira que dar\u00eda comienzo el 29 de julio de 1999 en la ciudad de Houston TX, seguida de varias presentaciones por diferentes ciudades de ese estado, para continuar en Phoenix, Tucson, San Diego, Anaheim, Mountain View, Concord, Sacramento, Seattle, Portland, Eugene, Boise, y Denver. Abrir\u00eda los conciertos el grupo Ozomatli, seguidos de Man\u00e1 y Carlos Santana alternando el orden de estos en cada una de sus presentaciones. Conciertos hist\u00f3ricos se llevan a cabo en el Arrowhead Pond en Anaheim, donde el grupo realiza cuatro shows sold out.\n \nLa combinaci\u00f3n de Man\u00e1 y Carlos Santana dej\u00f3 sin duda huella en el mercado de rock en espa\u00f1ol, como uno de los acontecimientos m\u00e1s grandes de la historia del g\u00e9nero en los Estados Unidos. En total Man\u00e1 y Santana hab\u00edan realizado 43 shows por Estados Unidos, Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, Guadalajara, y Monterrey al finalizar la gira en diciembre de 1999. \n \n\nMTV Unplugged\n\nLa cadena de videos MTV llevaba varios a\u00f1os solicitando a Man\u00e1 su participaci\u00f3n en la serie de grabaciones Unplugged, sin que la banda hubiese podido acceder a la petici\u00f3n debido a los compromisos que le significaban sus grabaciones y extensas giras. \nFinalmente se dieron las condiciones para el proyecto, por lo que el 9 de  Marzo de 1999 la banda graba Man\u00e1 Unplugged en Miami ante un \u00edntimo publico de 70 afortunados fans. En dicho material el grupo incluye \u00e9xitos de su repertorio m\u00e1s 3 covers en modalidad ac\u00fastica; tambi\u00e9n contiene el interludio musical \u00a8Coladito\u00a8, duelo de percusi\u00f3n entre Alex G\u00f3nzalez y el m\u00fasico invitado Lu\u00eds Conte, donde se pude apreciar la destreza de ambos ejecutantes.\n\nEl 22 de Junio de 1999 el material se lanza a la venta simult\u00e1neamente en todo el continente americano, alcanzando el primer lugar de ventas en el TOP 50 Latino de la revista Billboard, con lo cual la banda repite la haza\u00f1a de ser el \u00fanico grupo de rock latino en lograrlo. Hasta el momento, este disco sigue siendo uno de los m\u00e1s vendidos para la cadena de televisi\u00f3n, adem\u00e1s de que fue el primer artista latino en lanzar un material de este tipo (CD\/DVD).\n\nEl primer sencillo que se desprendi\u00f3 de esta producci\u00f3n, tema original de Juan Gabriel, \u201cSe me olvid\u00f3 otra vez\u201d permaneci\u00f3 durante m\u00e1s de 5 semanas consecutivas en el primer lugar en las listas de radio de gran parte de M\u00e9xico y Latinoam\u00e9rica. \u201cTe solt\u00e9 la rienda\u201d, del compositor Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez fue otro exitos\u00edsimo sencillo que se desprendi\u00f3 de esta grabaci\u00f3n. \n\nA principios de enero del 2000, Man\u00e1 recibe la noticia de su nominaci\u00f3n a los premios Grammy en la categor\u00eda de Mejor \u00c1lbum de Pop Latino por su disco MTV Unplugged, esta era la tercera vez consecutiva que el grupo estaba nominado a tan afamados premios.\n \nLa banda con muchas ganas de tocar arranca una gira por Sudam\u00e9rica y el Caribe el 17 de Marzo de 2000, visitando pa\u00edses como Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Uruguay, Puerto Rico y Republica Dominicana; las presentaciones en la capital Argentina lograron un \u00e9xito y expectaci\u00f3n impresionante, tras ofrecer un concierto en el Estadio Ferro de Buenos Aires a tan solo unas semanas de haber realizado 2 conciertos previos en el Luna Park de esa misma ciudad; lo mismo sucedi\u00f3 en el estadio Santa Laura, en Santiago de Chile. El resto de la gira luci\u00f3 con llenos totales en todos los lugares en donde Man\u00e1 se present\u00f3.\n\nA mediados del mes de abril en la ciudad de Miami, se celebraron los premios Billboard a la M\u00fasica Latina, en los cuales Man\u00e1 recibe 2 premios importantes, el primero al Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Pop Latino por su producci\u00f3n MTV Unplugged, y el segundo premio para la Fundaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica Selva Negra, denominado Spirit of Hope el cual se entrega \u00fanicamente a aquellos artistas que se han destacado por realizar acciones altruistas en pro del medio ambiente y de los derechos humanos.\n\nEn estas mismas fechas el grupo recibe un reconocimiento que por primera vez se les otorga, el premio que concede la cadena de renta y venta de videos y m\u00fasica m\u00e1s grande de los Estados Unidos, el Block Buster Award por Mejor Artista Latino.\n\nEn el mes de Junio Man\u00e1 comienza su Gira por Espa\u00f1a y las Canarias en un tour denominado Tourriata, visitando ciudades como:\nTenerife, Pamplona, Zaragoza, Toledo, Santiago, Burgos, Palencia, Zamora, Barcelona, Madrid, Victoria, San Sebasti\u00e1n, Gijon, La Coru\u00f1a, Elche, San Javier Murcia, Valencia, Sevilla, San Fernando y M\u00e1laga.\n\nCabe mencionar que en la capital espa\u00f1ola, las dos fechas en la plaza de toros Las Ventas fueron llenos totales, lo cual era una haza\u00f1a dif\u00edcil a\u00fan para los artistas de origen espa\u00f1ol, y un logro nunca antes alcanzado por una banda o artista latino. En el resto de la gira que realizaron a lo largo y ancho de la Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica lograron igualmente ventas totales.\n\nEn el mes de septiembre el grupo asiste a la primera entrega del Grammy Latino, en donde junto con Carlos Santana interpretaron el tema \u201cCoraz\u00f3n espinado\u201d, siendo \u00e9ste unos de los momentos m\u00e1s memorables de la noche. En dicha ceremonia Man\u00e1 resulto ganador de 3 Grammy por su participaci\u00f3n en el \u00e1lbum del guitarrista.  \n\nDurante su estancia en la ciudad de Los \u00c1ngeles, Man\u00e1 es invitado a interpretar el tema \u201cCoraz\u00f3n espinado\u201d al lado de Carlos Santana en el #1 talk show de los Estados Unidos \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d con  Jay Leno, quien reconoci\u00f3 a Man\u00e1 como el grupo de rock pop latino m\u00e1s importante.\n\nLa banda no para y lanza el compilatorio titulado Grandes Man\u00e1, cuya edici\u00f3n se hizo solamente para Europa y Escandinavia; a escasas semanas de haber salido a la venta ocup\u00f3 las primeras posiciones de la radio principalmente de la Pen\u00ednsula It\u00e1lica con el tema \u201cEn el Muelle de San Blas\u201d. Con este suceso Man\u00e1 visita en Noviembre del 2001 por primera vez Italia, en una gira promocional en la cual realizan un showcase en Mil\u00e1n para medios de comunicaci\u00f3n, personalidades y p\u00fablico en general. Italia adopt\u00f3 a Man\u00e1, la barrera del idioma se rompe y entran directo a los primeros lugares de la radio, apareciendo en las primeras planas de la prensa nacional Italiana.\n\n\n\nRevoluci\u00f3n de Amor\n\nA principios de 2002 la banda se encierra para componer y hacer demos de lo que ser\u00eda su pr\u00f3ximo disco de estudio a tres a\u00f1os del lanzamiento de Sue\u00f1os L\u00edquidos. Lanzan Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor en Junio de 2002, disco en \u00e9l que se muestra la b\u00fasqueda de la banda por mezclar su esencia con el sonido de rock de los sesentas y setentas, adem\u00e1s de otras fusiones de m\u00fasica latina. El resultado fue una colecci\u00f3n de grabaciones completamente energ\u00e9ticas, con un sonido que privilegia el de las guitarras pero que no renuncia a la b\u00fasqueda y la fusi\u00f3n. \nEste, su sexto \u00e1lbum de estudio, fue grabado en su totalidad en Los \u00c1ngeles, entre Febrero y Mayo de 2002 y cont\u00f3 con la participaci\u00f3n de Carlos Santana y su guitarra en el tema \u201cJusticia, Tierra y Libertad\u201d, as\u00ed como la de Rub\u00e9n Blades en \u201cS\u00e1banas fr\u00edas\u201d. Cabe destacar que el guitarrista del grupo, Sergio Vall\u00edn, particip\u00f3 cantando el tema \u201c\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 te vas?\u201d, dedicado a sus padres.\nRevoluci\u00f3n de Amor alcanz\u00f3  el primer lugar en ventas en Espa\u00f1a, Latinoam\u00e9rica y Estados Unidos durante cinco semanas consecutivas. Tuvo como sencillos m\u00e1s destacados \u201c\u00c1ngel de amor\u201d, \u201cEres mi religi\u00f3n\u201d y \u201cMariposa traicionera\u201d.\n \nGracias al \u00e9xito obtenido en Italia, el cantante Zucchero los invita a participar en la canci\u00f3n \u201cBaila morena\u201d, dueto que resulta todo un \u00e9xito tanto en Am\u00e9rica como en Europa. Man\u00e1 le devuelve el gesto al cantante al invitarlo a participar en la canci\u00f3n \u201cEres mi religi\u00f3n\u201d pero ahora en italiano, que luego fue incluida en una edici\u00f3n especial del disco Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor editado en Europa.\n \nEl 29 de Septiembre de 2002 Man\u00e1 se aventura a una nueva gira de dos a\u00f1os que los pondr\u00eda como nunca antes al mercado internacional. La gira llev\u00f3 al grupo no solo a ciudades de Estados Unidos, M\u00e9xico, Latinoam\u00e9rica y Espa\u00f1a, sino a nuevas plazas como Roma, Mil\u00e1n, Par\u00eds, Berl\u00edn, Eifel, Nuremberg, Munich, Stuggart, Hamburgo, R\u00edo de Janeiro y Sao Paolo. \n \nLa primera incursi\u00f3n de la banda en el dif\u00edcil mercado brasile\u00f1o se dio con llenos totales; lo mismo sucedi\u00f3 en sus presentaciones en Italia, Francia y Alemania donde alcanzaron un lugar entre los 30 mejores \u00e1lbumes respecto a ventas. En total, el grupo realiz\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 100 conciertos en 24 pa\u00edses.\n \nDurante su estancia por Europa, la banda particip\u00f3 en el especial Pavarotti & Friends al lado de Zucchero, donde se presentaron con estrellas de la talla de Bono, Eric Clapton, Lionel Ritchie, Queen, Deep Purple, Ricky Martin y Andrea Bocceli. \nMan\u00e1 recibe dos nominaciones en la 4ta entrega de los Grammy Latino que se realizaron en Miami el 3 de Septiembre de 2003, en las categor\u00edas de Mejor Ingenier\u00eda de Grabaci\u00f3n para un \u00c1lbum y Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock por un D\u00fao o Grupo, llev\u00e1ndose esta \u00faltima presea. \n \n\nEsenciales  Man\u00e1\n \nEl 18 de Noviembre de 2003 el grupo, cansado de tantos a\u00f1os de trabajo, decide tomar un a\u00f1o sab\u00e1tico y aprovechan para lanzar los recopilatorios Esenciales en tres versiones: Sol, Luna y Eclipse, que incluyen sus temas m\u00e1s exitosos y otras colaboraciones de la banda, como por ejemplo la versi\u00f3n de \u201cFool in the rain\u201d, canci\u00f3n original de Led Zeppelin incluida en el tributo Encomium al legendario grupo ingl\u00e9s y donde Man\u00e1 fue el \u00fanico artista latino invitado. Tambi\u00e9n se encuentra en la compilaci\u00f3n la canci\u00f3n in\u00e9dita \u201cTe llevar\u00e9 al cielo\u201d, tema que  se convirti\u00f3 en todo un \u00e9xito, alcanzando r\u00e1pidamente los primeros lugares de popularidad en radio y video.\nA manera de agradecimiento a sus seguidores, deciden poner a la venta el 12 de Diciembre de 2004 el DVD llamado Acceso Total, el cual incluye im\u00e1genes del tour Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor (2002-2003) m\u00e1s escenas nunca antes vistas en camerinos, permiti\u00e9ndole a los fans  tener \u2018acceso total\u2019 a la experiencia que vive Man\u00e1 en sus giras.  \n \n \nAmar es Combatir\nCasi 5 a\u00f1os hab\u00edan pasado desde el \u00faltimo disco de estudio de la banda, Revoluci\u00f3n de Amor,  por lo que ya corr\u00edan rumores y especulaciones sobre la separaci\u00f3n del grupo. Lo que nadie sab\u00eda era que tras su a\u00f1o sab\u00e1tico y desde principios de 2005, Man\u00e1 se reuni\u00f3 para empezar a componer su s\u00e9ptimo disco de estudio, Amar es Combatir. \n\nEn Febrero de 2006 la banda decide viajar a Miami, ciudad siempre vibrante, abrazada por el ambiente tropical y con una esencia latina que se respira en el aire, comuni\u00f3n id\u00f3nea para inspirar la grabaci\u00f3n de este CD en el que la banda llev\u00f3 a cabo una fusi\u00f3n de rock, pop, m\u00fasica latina, reggae, hasta drum and bass. Producido por Fher y Alex, al igual que sus discos anteriores, Amar es Combatir fue lanzado el 22 de agosto de 2006 y es editado en 40 pa\u00edses alrededor del mundo, alcanzando el n\u00famero 4 en el Top 200 \u00c1lbumes de la revista Billboard en los Estados Unidos, r\u00e9cord solamente alcanzado para una producci\u00f3n enteramente en espa\u00f1ol por el \u00e1lbum Fijaci\u00f3n Oral Vol. 1 de Shakira.\n \nSu primer sencillo, \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d, permanece durante ocho semanas consecutivas en el primer lugar de los charts latinos de radio y es nombrado entre los medios latinos m\u00e1s reconocidos de la uni\u00f3n Americana como uno de los tracks m\u00e1s escuchados y premiados del 2006. \n \nLos sencillos que le siguieron, \u201cBendita tu luz\u201d (a d\u00fao con Ju\u00e1n Luis Guerra) y \u201cManda una se\u00f1al\u201d se posicionan tambi\u00e9n en el primer lugar de las listas de popularidad. A estos se agregar\u00eda un quinto sencillo, \u201cEl rey tibur\u00f3n\u201d, lo cual es un logro a destacar ya que es cada vez menos frecuente que de una producci\u00f3n se desprendan 5 sencillos, dada la complicada situaci\u00f3n por la que atraviesa la industria. \n \nEn noviembre de 2006 el grupo participa en la 7ma edici\u00f3n del Grammy Latino, donde adem\u00e1s de actuar junto a Ju\u00e1n Luis Guerra con un excelente performance de sus \u00e9xitos, que les vali\u00f3 una sentida ovaci\u00f3n de parte de los asistentes al evento y que fue uno de los momentos cl\u00edmax de la velada, reciben un homenaje por su trayectoria art\u00edstica y logros en la m\u00fasica. \n \nEn febrero de 2007 y tras recibir 5 nominaciones a los premios Billboard Latino, 4 nominaciones a los premios Lo Nuestro y una al Grammy Americano como Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Alternativo o Urbano, Man\u00e1 inicia su gira Amar Es Combatir World Tour, con la mayor producci\u00f3n que haya tenido el grupo hasta el momento (m\u00e1s de 60 toneladas de equipo), la cual los llevar\u00eda a dar 116 conciertos durante un per\u00edodo de un a\u00f1o y medio. \n \nLos conciertos de Man\u00e1 en Estados Unidos y Puerto Rico, incluyeron shows en ciudades como San Diego, Los \u00c1ngeles, Laredo, Houston, Corpus Christi, Miami, Orlando, Nueva York, Washington, Chicago, Atlanta y San Ju\u00e1n de Puerto Rico. Man\u00e1 se convierte en la primera banda de rock pop en espa\u00f1ol en llenar por tres noches (dos consecutivas) el Madison Square Garden de Nueva York. Destacan tambi\u00e9n sus cuatro conciertos sold out consecutivos en el Staple Center de Los \u00c1ngeles, tres noches sold out en el Miami American Airlines Arena, tres m\u00e1s en el Toyota Center de Houston y cuatro sold out en el Coliseo Jos\u00e9 M. Agrelot de Puerto Rico. \nAdem\u00e1s de reunirse en Washington D.C. con la senadora estadounidense  Hillary Clinton para compartir opiniones sobre el medio ambiente y migraci\u00f3n, Man\u00e1 recibe un reconocimiento por las m\u00e1s de 450,000 descargas de su ringtone \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d.\n\nSu gira por Latinoam\u00e9rica incluy\u00f3 conciertos en Chile, Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Panam\u00e1, Venezuela, Colombia, Per\u00fa, Brasil y Rep\u00fablica Dominicana.

Este premio se entrega de acuerdo a las ventas que un artista logr\u00f3 durante un a\u00f1o y donde Man\u00e1 comparti\u00f3 escenario al lado de artistas como Celine Dion, Avril Lavigne, Rihanna, Patty Labelle, entre otros.  \n\nEntre los premios m\u00e1s destacados que la banda obtuvo por esta producci\u00f3n se encuentra un Grammy Americano en el rubro de Mejor \u00c1lbum de Rock Alternativo o Urbano, 3 galardones Lo Nuestro por \u00c1lbum de Rock del A\u00f1o, Artista Rock del A\u00f1o y canci\u00f3n Rock del A\u00f1o; 2 Billboard Latinos por \u00c1lbum Rock Alternativo del A\u00f1o y tema Pop Airplay del A\u00f1o de D\u00fao o Grupo. \n\n\nArde El Cielo\n\nLa impresionante respuesta que tuvo la gira Amar Es Combatir World Tour fue una experiencia sorprendente para la banda, por lo que decidieron capturar esa energ\u00eda, esa adrenalina, en una grabaci\u00f3n con la cual sus seguidores pudieran recordar y revivir esos momentos. As\u00ed, la banda decide grabar dos de sus cuatro presentaciones en el Coliseo Jos\u00e9 M. Agrelot de Puerto Rico en Marzo de 2007. \n\nEl 29 de Abril del mismo a\u00f1o Man\u00e1 presenta en Los \u00c1ngeles el CD\/DVD llamado Arde el Cielo, el cual fue grabado durante el Amar Es Combatir World Tour. \n\nEl material contiene 12 temas en directo que representan y repasan la historia de Man\u00e1, desde \u201cRayando el sol\u201d a \u201cLabios compartidos\u201d, pasando por \u201cEl rey\u201d y canciones tan conocidas como \u201cEn el Muelle de San Blas\" o \u201cVivir sin aire\u201d, as\u00ed como dos temas in\u00e9ditos grabados en estudio. El primero de estos temas in\u00e9ditos es \"Si no te hubieras ido\", una canci\u00f3n de Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds ya versionada por otros artistas pero en la que Man\u00e1 supo poner su peculiar sello.\nEl segundo tema in\u00e9dito del CD es \"Arde el cielo\" un tema compuesto por Fher y producido en conjunto con \u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez.

Since forming in 1973, AC\/DC's high voltage rock 'n' roll has flowed out into the world via consistently sold-out concert tours and global sales totaling more than 150 million albums and counting.  Sony BMG Music Entertainment's  #1 best-selling catalog act worldwide, AC\/DC has sold nearly 70 million albums in the U.S. alone, making AC\/DC one of the five top-selling bands in American music history.  One of the group's best-loved works, the enormously successful and influential \"Back In Black,\" has achieved RIAA \"Double Diamond\" status, for sales in excess of 21 million copies in the United States, and is the U.S.'s fifth largest-selling album ever.\n\n \n\nBut the roots of AC\/DC lie back in Australia, and before that Glasgow, Scotland, where Angus and Malcolm Young, the musical core of the band (and still the most formidable guitar team in rock history), were born (in 1958 and 1953, respectively).  In 1963, the Young family migrated to Sydney, Australia, where music would make its mark on the brothers.  (As a member of the Easybeats, Angus and Malcolm's older sibling, George Young, was responsible for one of Australia's first international hits, \"Friday On My Mind,\" in 1966.  From 1974 through 2000, George and musical collaborator, Harry Vanda, produced a number of AC\/DC albums including \"High Voltage,,\" \"T.N.T.,\" \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap,\" \"Let There Be Rock,\" \"If You Want Blood You've Got It,\" \"Powerage,\" \"'74 Jailbreak,\" \"Who Made Who,\" \"Blow Up Your Video,\" and \"Stiff Upper Lip.\")","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Rock","hometown":"Sydney, Australia","is_published":true,"record_label":"Columbia Records","talking_about_count":137359,"username":"acdc","website":"http:\/\/www.acdc.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"6750402929","name":"AC\/DC","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/acdc","likes":27113237,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151698627917930","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/946500_10151698627917930_757216724_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Pre-order the new 7 Days of Funk album, out 12\/10! http:\/\/bit.ly\/1cp9vz6","band_members":"Snoop Dogg","bio":"With today\u2019s proliferation of mass media, pop culture icons have a tendency to seem overly ubiquitous. They stare at us from the covers of glossy magazines, talk to us from both the small and silver screen, interact with us through our laptops and hypnotize us with their inescapable hit singles. But too often these days, while our biggest stars may be omnipresent in our lives, we feel no genuine connection to them or their artistry.\n\nYet, hip-hop icon Snoop Dogg is different. While, he\u2019s everywhere, all of the time\u2014from The View to 106th & Park, Sportscenter to One Life To Live, and from commercials with Adidas to Pepsi Max\u2014Snoop\u2019s continuing appeal to his legions of fans stems from a true bond that they have built with him through his music. And like Bigg Snoop, the music\u2019s been everywhere. Whether it\u2019s a stadium stage or the screen on your mobile phone, Snoop has most likely rocked it.\nNow, as anticipation steadily climbs for his quickly approaching 11th studio album, Doggumentary, Tha Doggfather is continuing to enhance his connection with his fans through his music. Not only is Snoop utilizing his unrivaled digital presence to offer his fans inside access to the creative process behind the Doggumentary, but the album itself acts a memoir of sorts\u2014both chronicling his journey in the game thus far and plotting where his path will lead him in the future.\nThe latest collection reflects everything that the world has come to embrace about the man born Calvin Broadus. While delivering several of the bombastic street raps that initially propelled Snoop to stardom, Doggumentary also boasts the sort of unpredictable collaborations that have made him a pop culture phenomenon.\n \nUnafraid to experiment with his established sound, the intoxicating lead single \"Wet\" sees Snoop working with the newly hot production duo The Cataracs. Together, they unite to startling effect, creating an entrancing and atmospheric club jam that has already pounced on various radio formats. Another first-time contributor to Snoop's illustrious catalogue is producer Lex Luger. The native Virginian (responsible for Rick Ross' thunderous anthems \u201cMC Hammer\u201d and  \"B.M.F.\") provides Tha Bigg Boss Dogg with something even more triumphant\u2014the fittingly titled \"Platinum,\" a song that also reunites Snoop with famed crooner R. Kelly.\nFrom here, Snoop continues to roll out the blue carpet, inviting alternative heroes Gorillaz to provide the psychedelic organ thrusts to Snoop\u2019s unusually playful flow on \"Sumthin Like This Night\". Rising sensation Wiz Khalifa stops by for the playful, self-explanatory \"This Weed Iz Mine,\"  which sees our host gleefully announce that he's taking it back to \"classic Snoop.\" Then the melancholy strings of the Kanye West produced \"Eyez Closed\" inspire a wizened D-O-Double G to both reflect and caution, \"If you taste success, make sure it's from a tall glass.\" Still the energy immediately ramps up with the surefire hit \"Boom\" featuring T-Pain. Here, Snoop announces himself the \"chief rocka\" over producer Scott Storch\u2019s ingeniously utilized sample of Yaz\u2019 \u201cSituation\u201d.\nWhile mainstream audiences will undoubtedly rapturously receive the aforementioned, Snoop spends ample time on Doggumentary rewarding his loyal core fanbase. \"My Fucn House\" is as authoritative as its title suggests, as Snoop, Jeezy and E-40 delve into the trap over Rick Rock's energetic pomp. \"We Rest N Cali\" is Snoop's unapologetic ode to California's more sinister dwellings, aided by a typically merciless Goldie Loc. \"Gangbang Rookie\" will be considered vintage Snoop as he asserts himself as, \"a Boss out here on the West\" over Jake One's rattling funk. While Jake does an impeccable job recreating West Coast G-Funk on both \"Rookie\" and the album intro \"Toyz N Da Hood,\" Snoop recruits a few other notable comrades to assist. These include Battlecat (\"The Way Life Used To Be,\" \"Wonder What It Do\"), Fredwreck (\"Peer Pressure\"), and Meech Wells (\"Take U Home.\") All mentioned succeed in conjuring definitive Snoop, whether he is shamelessly spitting game, confronting adversaries, or reflecting on his incredible career trajectory\n \nTo promote Doggumentary, Snoop has wisely conceptualized the album\u2019s title. By aligning his social media prowess with his creative output, Snoop is \"doggumenting\" the album\u2019s progress online. He has already launched the much discussed #PuffPuffPassTuesdays campaign, where he releases exclusive visual and audio content to his 2.5 million Twitter followers every week. Next, unprecedented access to Snoop's inner circle is granted via his frequent Ustream sessions. These afford millions of fans across the globe the opportunity to log-in and interact with Snoop live, as he streams new music. Snoop is also responsible for the prolific WestFestTV channel on YouTube, which regularly uploads candid footage of Snoop in action and a slew of viral music videos.\nSnoop Dogg's ability to stay at the forefront of popular culture and connect with his fans has resulted in unwavering relevance. While he\u2019s a TV and movie star, the founder and coach of a hugely successful youth football league and a savvy adapter of new technology, Snoop Dogg remains Tha Doggfather of hip-hop. Incredibly, his music is as \"doggumented\" now as it was in 1992 around the launch of his timeless debut Doggystyle. In fact, a stronghold over the various social networking platforms makes him more accessible than ever. With all eyes on the skinny kingpin from Long Beach, Doggumentary is the perfect title for the man who continues to occupy thethrone as the world\u2019s most famous rapper.\n\n\n","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Hip Hop \/ Rap \/ R&B","hometown":"Long Beach, CA","is_published":true,"record_label":"Priority\/Doggystyle ","talking_about_count":223947,"username":"snoopdogg","website":"http:\/\/SnoopDogg.com ","were_here_count":0,"id":"11455644806","name":"Snoop Dogg","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/snoopdogg","likes":29664570,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151897533874807","source":"http:\/\/sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/s720x720\/1426477_10151897533874807_1510543429_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

The epitome of Southern rock music, Skynyrd does not offer high-concept gloss. Instead, since its emergence from the Jacksonville, Fla. music scene, Skynyrd has consistently spoken about the harsh humanity facing the American everyman. \"We saw the Beatles on Ed Sullivan like everybody else in our generation, and freaked out and wanted to start a rock'n'roll band,\" Skynyrd guitarist Gary Rossington told Billboard. \"But then we got serious, and we really had this dream to become something, to make a mark. We just worked and sweated our way to it. We had that fire in our eyes.\"\n            After over 30 years in the business and 26 million records sold worldwide, the fire has yet to burn out. Skynyrd was inducted into the Rock n\u2019 Roll Hall of Fame last March. It was a moment of recognition long-overdue. Original Skynyrd keyboardist Billy Powell told reporters upon receiving the honor, \u201cObviously this proves that the music is here to stay. It certainly completes a lifetime accomplishment for me.\u201d\n            Lynyrd Skynyrd continues to entertain audiences both young and old. In 2007 the band set sail on its first ever Gimme Three Days cruise to the Caribbean with three separate performances for a sold-out audience! \n            Despite their intensive touring schedule that routinely includes nearly 100 dates a year, Skynyrd even now comes across as seamless road veterans. They have recently toured with their contemporaries the Allman Brothers as well as Kid Rock, Sammy Hagar and of course, 3 Doors Down, and of course current tour mate, Hank Williams Jr. It\u2019s only fitting that the kings of modern rock music continue to shoulder on after all these years while touring with fresh-faced contenders to their crown. The resulting \u201cRowdy Frynds\u201d tour has been years in the making, and is something Hank Williams Jr. is looking forward to as well. \n            \u201cLynyrd Skynyrd and Hank Williams Jr. on the stage together in the same night,\u201d Hank Williams Jr. commented, \u201ctalk about a show! I can\u2019t wait to see what happens in these cities!\u201d\n\u201cHank played with Skynyrd years ago and it was one heck of a show. Since then, we\u2019ve been looking for the opportunity to tour together,\u201d said Johnny Van Zant of Lynyrd Skynyrd, \u201cbecause his fans are our fans, and vice versa.\u201d\nGary Rossington of Lynyrd Skynyrd added, \u201cWe will be playing on Friday and Saturday nights to ensure all our \u2018Rowdy Frynds\u2019 can party with us all night long.\u201d\n\n","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Jacksonville, FL ","genre":"Southern Rock, Blues Rock ","hometown":"Jacksonville, FL","is_published":true,"record_label":"RoadRunner Records","talking_about_count":104090,"username":"LynyrdSkynyrd","website":"http:\/\/www.lynyrdskynyrd.com http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/lynyrdskynyrd http:\/\/www.ilike.com\/artist\/Lynyrd+Skynyrd","were_here_count":0,"id":"6983887641","name":"Lynyrd Skynyrd","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/LynyrdSkynyrd","likes":3680900,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152059690632642","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1395953_10152059690632642_1558642518_n.jpg","offset_y":67,"offset_x":0}}

For a few years now we've been appearing on the television show Scrubs as 'Ted's Band' where, as luck would have it, we have to pretend to be a quartet of friends who like to sing a cappella music. We\u2019ve put out a CD, and we do live shows, where you can see us singing TV and movie themes such as \"Charles in Charge\" and the \"Superman March.\" We also do songs with talking toys - that's right, four grown men who still play with dolls... er, uh, action figures. If you want to know more about us and listen to some of our music, go to our website (lots of video clips there too). \n\nABOUT OUR LIVE SHOW\n\nWhat we do on the TV show Scrubs is just one part of what we do live, in real life, as a real performing group that pre-dates the existence of Scrubs.  And we are the same four guys live on stage that you\u2019ve seen on the tube.\n\nThe Blanks performances are made up of songs and comedy, sometimes at the same time even!  You haven\u2019t seen anything quite like it before.  We love to sing, entertain and make people laugh, so our shows include skits, antics, choreography (the kind a 5-year old could memorize), talking toys as lead singers (!), and costume changes.  \n\nA note on the costume changes: we\u2019re not Cher, and we\u2019re not Madonna.  Because\u2026 We\u2019re men!  Men who sing.  Men who dance.  Men who\u2019ll make the milk you\u2019re drinking spray right out your nose with a funny glance. \n\nCome see us live and you\u2019ll be in for a night of laughs, songs and our version of entertainment for any age. \n\nRecent live show reviews:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve produced and attended countless shows over the years, and it\u2019s such a rare treat to be able to confidently say \u2018I know a hit when I see one\u2019.

Besides their fabulous singing talents, they incorporate elements of that unique type of big-time NYC and Vegas-style pizzazz that can somehow meld families, college students, the most committed headbangers, Goths, country, classical and jazz fans all together into one enthusiastically happy audience. The post-show autograph signing was a mayhem of fan rabidity. Over the years, I\u2019ve seen cult followings develop following some of our shows of now-household names in show business, and I\u2019m convinced that they\u2019ve managed to convert yet another fan in yours truly.

{"about":"www.thedoors.com","band_members":"Jim Morrison- vocals\nRay Manzarek- organ, keyboards\nRobby Krieger- guitar\nJohn Densmore- drums","bio":"With an intoxicating, genre-blending sound, provocative and uncompromising songs, and the mesmerizing power of singer Jim Morrison's poetry and presence, The Doors had a transformative impact not only on popular music but on popular culture.\n\nThe Doors' arrival on the rock scene in 1967 marked not only the start of a string of hit singles and albums that would become stone classics, but also of something much bigger - a new and deeper relationship between creators and audience.  Refusing to be mere entertainers, the Los Angeles quartet relentlessly challenged, confronted and inspired their fans, leaping headfirst into the heart of darkness while other bands warbled about peace and love.  Though they've had scores of imitators, there's never been another band quite like them.  And 40 years after their debut album, The Doors' music and legacy are more influential than ever before.\n\nMorrison's mystical command of the frontman role may be the iconic heart of The Doors, but the group's extraordinary power would hardly have been possible without the virtuosic keyboard tapestries of Ray Manzarek, the gritty, expressive fretwork of guitarist Robby Krieger and the supple, dynamically rich grooves of drummer John Densmore. From baroque art-rock to jazz-infused pop to gutbucket blues, the band's instrumental triad could navigate any musical territory with aplomb - and all three contributed mightily as songwriters.\n\t\t\t\nThe group was born when Morrison and Manzarek - who'd met at UCLA's film school - met again, unexpectedly, on the beach in Venice, CA, during the summer of 1965.  Though he'd never intended to be a singer, Morrison was invited to join Manzarek's group Rick and the Ravens on the strength of his poetry.  Krieger and Densmore, who\u2019d played together in the band Psychedelic Rangers, were recruited soon thereafter; though several bassists auditioned of the new collective, none could furnish the bottom end as effectively as Manzarek's left hand.  Taking their name from Aldous Huxley's psychotropic monograph The Doors of Perception, the band signed to Elektra Records following a now-legendary gig at the Whisky-a-Go-Go on the Sunset Strip.\n\nTheir eponymous first album, released in January 1967, kicked off with \"Break on Through (to the Other Side)\" and also featured the chart smash \"Light My Fire\", the scorching \"Back Door Man\" and the visionary masterpiece \"The End\".  The Doors arrived fully formed, capable of rocking the pop charts and the avant-garde with one staggering disc.  Before '67 was over, they'd issued the ambitious follow-up Strange Days, with such gems as \"Love Me Two Times\", \"People\nAre Strange\" and \"When the Music's Over\".\n\nNext came 1968's Waiting for the Sun, boasting \"Hello, I Love You\", \"Love Street\" and \"Five to One\".  Over the next few years they minded over new territory on such albums as 1969's The Soft Parade (featuring \"Touch Me\" and \"Tell All the People\"), 1970's Morrison Hotel (which includes \"Roadhouse Blues\", \"Peace Frog\" and \"Queen of the Highway\") and 1971's L.A. Woman (boasting \"Rider's on the Storm\", \"Love Her Madly\" and the title track).\n\nThey released six studio albums in all, as well as a live album and a compilation, before Morrison's death in 1971.  their electrifying achievements in the studio and onstage were unmatched in the annals of rock; and though Morrison's death meant the end of an era, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore collaborated on two more original Doors albums, Other Voices and Full Circle, and a set of tracks they composed to accompany Morrison's 1969 recording of his poetry, released in 1978 as An American Prayer.  They also pursued individual music projects, books, theatrical productions and other enterprises - and remain restlessly creative to this day.\n\nIn the decades since the Doors' heyday, the foursome has loomed ever larger in the pantheon of rock - and they remain a touchstone of insurrectionary culture for writers, activists, visual artists and other creative communities.  Their songs, featured in an ever-increasing number of films, TV shows, video games and remixes, always sound uncannily contemporary.  No matter how the musical and cultural tides turn, The Doors will always be ready to help a new wave of listeners break on through to the other side.\n\n ","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Los Angeles, CA","general_manager":"Jeffrey Jampol for JAM, Inc.","genre":"Psychedelic rock, Blues rock","hometown":"Los Angeles, California, United States","is_published":true,"press_contact":"www.wemanagelegends.com","record_label":"Elektra Records, Rhino Records","talking_about_count":196298,"username":"thedoors","website":"http:\/\/www.thedoors.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"8606723411","name":"The Doors","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thedoors","likes":14560618,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151860697318412","source":"http:\/\/sphotos-e.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/s720x720\/1488210_10151860697318412_159564806_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"News and random musings from Guster.","band_members":"Ryan, Adam, Brian, Luke","bio":"Ever since their humble beginnings at Tufts University, Guster have always sought to outdo themselves. They sell out New York\u2019s fabled Radio City Music Hall one year and perform with the Boston Pops at Symphony Hall the next. They sell out a 33-date college tour, and this past spring founded the eco-friendly Campus Consciousness Tour, with buses powered by biodiesel and performances powered by wind power. It\u2019s in this overachieving band\u2019s nature to one-up itself. \n\nSo don\u2019t expect it to be any different with the release of Guster\u2019s new album, Ganging Up on the Sun. The Boston-bred band\u2019s fifth studio release may be a melody-minded, breezy, free-spirited, literate pop record like its predecessors\u20142003\u2019s Keep it Together, 1999\u2019s Lost and Gone Forever, 1996\u2019s Goldfly, and 1994\u2019s Parachute\u2014but this time around, Guster are \u201cmore fearless than ever before,\u201d says singer-guitarist Ryan Miller. They\u2019ve pushed themselves both stylistically and emotionally, resulting in their most confident and superlative work to date. \n\n\u201cThis album has our loudest song (\u201cThe Beginning of the End\u201d), our quietest (\u201cEmpire State\u201d), and our longest (\u201cRuby Falls\u201d). \u201cOne song has one of our most sincere lyrics (\u201cHang On\u201d) and definitely some of our most cynical.\u201d While Miller doesn\u2019t cop to any specific lyrical themes (\u201cI write a melody and words pop up around it\u201d), he does note that most of the words were written against the backdrop of \u201ca president taking a country to war based on some very dubious rationale.\u201d \n\nYou can hear a thread of dissent in songs like \u201cCaptain,\u201d \u201cLightning Rod,\u201d \u201cManifest Destiny,\u201d and \u201cThe New Underground.\u201d \u201cBut I never want to be preachy,\u201d Miller says. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you whose face to throw a pie in. I\u2019m just trying to exorcise some frustration, some anger, and maybe a provide a channel for someone else\u2019s frustration and anger.\u201d \n\nGanging Up on the Sun\u2019s sunny, driving-with-the-top-down melodies, vintage harmonies, and warm guitar jangle do recall artists you\u2019d associate with the \u201960s and \u201970s\u2014bands who also wrote during a time of war and societal mistrust of government\u2014such as CSNY, Mamas and the Papas, Fleetwood Mac, the Band, the Rolling Stones, and Tom Petty. Are Guster wearing their influences a bit more on their sleeve this time around? \n\n\u201cThe word \u2018classic\u2019 was used a lot throughout recording as a goal for the sound of this album,\u201d singer-guitarist Adam Gardner says, \u201cand it definitely has a more classic rock feel to it.\u201d Adds Rosenworcel: \u201cI think when we switched from the \u2018just guitars and percussion\u2019 shtick to using whatever was in front of us, we ended up sounding more like bands we were listening to.\u201d \n\nThe shtick he\u2019s referring to is Guster\u2019s early years as a trio when, onstage, front men Miller and Gardner stuck to acoustic guitars and Rosenworcel played bongos with his bare hands. They\u2019ve come a long way since then, and even added a member. Ganging Up on the Sun is Guster\u2019s first album as a four-piece: Joe Pisapia, a Nashville-based multi-instrumentalist who played on Keep it Together and performs with them live, joined full-time when they began recording the new album.\n\n\u201cJoe is by far the best musician in the band,\u201d says Miller. \u201cHe can play every instrument and has taken our level of musicianship up about seven notches. Brian, Adam, and I spent ten years together in rooms, buses, and vans\u2014it means so much to have this new energy as part of our equation. It still feels very much like Guster, just a more confident, muscular, refined Guster.\u201d\n\nNot only did Pisapia add texture and oomph to the tracks by playing banjo, dulcimer, trumpet, and lap steel guitar, he also served as producer for half of the songs, which were recorded at Nashville\u2019s Sound Emporium and completed at Pisapia\u2019s home studio, Ivy League, from January to April 2005. The second batch were recorded later in the year at the secluded mountaintop studio Allaire in Shokan, New York, with Ron Aniello, who also worked on Keep it Together. \n\n\"I think in the back of my mind I knew we were writing our best material yet,\" says Rosenworcel. One of the highlights is the lead-off single \u201cOne Man Wrecking Machine,\u201d which is about a guy who hates his life and wants to go back to \u201cthe good ole days\u201d and hang out with his buddies, get high, and make out with the hottest girl in school, as Miller puts it. \u201cI\u2019ve had that fantasy my entire adult life,\u201d he says, \u201cLike, what if I had the confidence of a 30-year-old man as a high school sophomore?\u201d \n\nAnother highlight on Ganging Up on the Sun is the seven-minute \u201cRuby Falls,\u201d a celestial epic that features an uncharacteristic muted trumpet in the outro (\u201cI listen to that solo and think \u2018that\u2019s on my record\u2019?\u201d says Rosenworcel). \u201cPersonally, I can\u2019t wait to play \u2018Ruby Falls\u2019 live,\u201d says Miller. \u201cNot just because I love the song, but because I think there\u2019s a power to it that may even be bigger than what we captured in the studio. Or I could be wrong and we\u2019ll sound like the Carpenters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just love that our band feels unpredictable right now,\u201d Rosenworcel says happily. \u201cI love that no one knows what to expect from us.\u201d\n","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Boston","genre":"Rock","hometown":"Boston","is_published":true,"record_label":"Ocho Mule","talking_about_count":5698,"username":"Gustermusic","website":"http:\/\/www.guster.com http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/guster http:\/\/www.ilike.com\/artist\/Guster http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/guster http:\/\/www.districtlines.com\/guster (STORE) http:\/\/twitter.com\/guster BRIAN: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/profile.php?id=100000649396624","were_here_count":0,"id":"7219382370","name":"Guster","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Gustermusic","likes":233212,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150784780232371","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/540073_10150784780232371_307111753_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The new album Opposites - Available to buy now at http:\/\/smarturl.it\/Biffy_webstore or http:\/\/smarturl.it\/Biffy_Opposites ","band_members":"- Simon Neil - guitars, vocals\n- James Johnston - bass, vocals\n- Ben Johnston - drums, vocals","bio":"2007 was the year the tortoise overtook the complacent hare and claimed the glory. Faced with a musical climate of TV talent freakshow contestants momentarily setting the gossip world aflutter before plunging back into obscurity, and fame hungry starlets publicly unravelling in front of the paparazzi, the alternative came in the shape of \u2018Puzzle,\u2019 the fourth album by Ayrshire rock trio Biffy Clyro, which exploded to propel the band out of the underground where they\u2019d been honing their craft and into the mainstream consciousness. The gold-selling major label debut went on to shift over 250,000 copies, to the delight of the loyal and passionate fanbase who had been willing them on for the past decade. An overnight success story, this is not. \n\nBiffy Clyro came together in 1995 in a school in Kilmarnock, just outside of Glasgow, when childhood friends Simon Neil (vocals\/guitar) and twins James (bass\/vocals) and Ben Johnston (drums\/vocals) started playing music together. United by a love of underground, experimental rock and post-hardcore bands such as Braid and Karate, along with the starrier likes of Guns N\u2019Roses and Metallica, they quickly honed their own unique sound, a mind boggling mix of off-kilter tempos, itchy, unpredictable guitars, soulful choruses and feral screams, sewn together into a strange tapestry of sound that sat resolutely apart anything else being made at the time, both in spirit and - thanks to their admirable refusal to uproot from their hometown for the dog eat dog music community of London - geographically too. \n\nTheir first three albums \u2013 \u2018Blackened Sky\u2019, \u2018The Vertigo Of Bliss\u2019 and \u2018Infinity Land\u2019 \u2013 arrived in a barrage of creativity, a record released every year and relentless touring building up a small but devoted army of followers. Team Biffy\u2019s ranks grew exponentially when \u2018Puzzle\u2019 came along and stunned listeners with its achingly personal, rich and complex take on rock anthems, and Simon, James and Ben found themselves playing Wembley Stadium with Muse, headlining the John Peel Stage at Glastonbury and gigging with The Rolling Stones. U2 even supported them at a special Little Noise session at London\u2019s Union Chapel, although the highlight for the band came when they headlined in front of a hometown crowd at Glasgow\u2019s SECC. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I saw Metallica in 1991,\u201d says Simon. \u201cWe played there last December, in that same room. It\u2019s amazing how things work out.\u201d \n\nAmazing, but perhaps not surprising when you hear their new album \u2018Only Revolutions\u2019. It is, quite simply, a monster of rock. After the overwhelming sadness of \u2018Puzzle\u2019, which was written in the aftermath of Simon\u2019s mother passing away, \u2018Only Revolutions\u2019 has a sense of joy and determination, from the military thump of feet that heralds in opener \u2018The Captain\u2019 before it slips into an explosion of mammoth riffage, fizzing pop vocals and euphoric horns, through the agony and ecstasy questioning of the acoustic \u2018God And Satan\u2019, the sexy, sleazy \u2018Born On A Horse\u2019, the hauntingly romantic yet roaringly, soaringly powerful \u2018Many Of Horror\u2019 to the dark and visceral nastiness of \u2018Shock Shock\u2019. And, of course, the already familiar skewed cinematic rock of the massive top 10 singles \u2018Mountains\u2019 and \u2018That Golden Rule\u2019, which fans have already clutched firmly to their collective bosom like old friends. \n\nSimon explains: \u201cPuzzle is so heavily about sadness and depression and being in a really horrible part of your life that everybody will go through. This one just felt immediately more hopeful. I think all good music and good art is a reflection of how the creator is feeling at that certain point.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe title is taken from a book by Mark Danielewski, he\u2019s my favourite writer,\u201d he continues. \u201cIn half of the book the man\u2019s telling his half of the story and the other half is the girl telling her side of the story. That really touched me. With the songs I\u2019m trying to give both lovers\u2019 aspect of the same story. It\u2019s a give and take you have when you\u2019re madly in love with someone, but also you both see exactly the same things in completely different ways. The title \u2018Only Revolutions\u2019 summed it up perfectly.\u201d \n\nThe album was recorded in LA during the summer, with \u2018Puzzle\u2019 producer Garth Richardson (Rage Against The Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers) at the helm once more. Their relationship got off to a rocky start, but these days he\u2019s embraced as part of Team Biffy. \n\n\u201cLast time we butted heads a lot,\u201d Simon admits. \u201cWe got in each other\u2019s faces trying to feel each other out. This time I think he trusts us a lot more, we trust him a lot more. Last time Garth didn\u2019t understand why we were doing weird things with the songs. It\u2019s what we do! But he nailed it, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d \n\nGarth isn\u2019t the only person to bring his own special brand of magic to \u2018Only Revolutions\u2019. Multi Grammy-winning composer David Campbell - who played bass on Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u2018Let\u2019s Get It On\u2019, has worked with such luminaries as Carole King, Bob Dylan, Metallica, and Radiohead, won an Oscar for writing the score to \u2018Brokeback Mountain\u2019, and fathered Beck - adds lush orchestral flourishes, strings and horns throughout. And after spending time on the road with Queens Of The Stone Age, Biffy made firm friends with the inimitable Josh Homme. Keen to collaborate with the like-minded frontman, they invited him in to contribute to \u2018Bubbles\u2019, a great sprawling, spaced-out epic that leaps out of the speakers to beat you merrily into submission. \n\n\u201cSomeone like Josh, it\u2019s like he\u2019s a musical lifer,\u201d says Simon. \u201cWe are as well, and I think when you meet people you can see in their eyes whether they really mean it or not. It\u2019s kind of weird being friends with someone who\u2019s a hero like Josh, but I see in him what I see in myself and he sees in us what he saw in himself, that kind of hunger and willingness and doing it for the right reasons. It\u2019s really easy to connect with people because of that.\u201d \n\nFor all the starry input though, this is very much about the three old friends in the band. They still rehearse in a farmhouse near their childhood homes, and when they get together you can always expect them to come up with the unexpected. Not one of their albums sounds too much like its predecessor, each one brimming over with new ideas and directions that couldn\u2019t be contained even if they tried to rein them in and tame them. And that\u2019s why \u2018Only Revolutions\u2019, while being unmistakably a Biffy album, is something brand new again, perfectly crafted, produced and polished without ever once losing the heart, soul and strangeness that means so much to those who have been faithful from the start. And most of all, it means everything to Simon Neil and James and Ben Johnston. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing this for each other,\u201d says Simon. \u201cWe\u2019re still as much of a gang as we were at the start. I\u2019m doing this for Ben and James as much as they\u2019re doing it for me. I think that\u2019s important. Sometimes success can drive a wedge between a band, but because we\u2019ve been friends since we were eight, playing music since we were 13 or 14, we couldn\u2019t live life without each other in it and we couldn\u2019t live life without this band. It really is what makes my heart beat every day.\u201d","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Glasgow, UK","is_published":true,"press_contact":"info\u0040biffyclyro.com","record_label":"14th Floor Records","talking_about_count":11548,"username":"biffyclyro","website":"www.biffyclyro.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"9549315029","name":"Biffy Clyro","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/biffyclyro","likes":873051,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151881749615030","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1044703_10151881749615030_1025967224_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":40}}

Ever since their formation in 1998, they\u2019ve stayed true to themselves with each successive record. There\u2019s no pretense. There\u2019s no posturing. There\u2019s no pandering. Their seventh full-length effort, A War You Cannot Win [Razor & Tie], is no exception. The Massachusetts quintet\u2014Philip Labonte [vocals], Oli Herbert [guitar], Mike Martin [guitar], Jeanne Sagan [bass], and Jason Costa [drums]\u2014unabashedly unleash tight and taut heavy metal with arena-size hooks. Defying preconceived notions, the music is as genuine as it gets, and All That Remains wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nGoing into A War You Cannot Win, the group didn\u2019t tinker with their process much. Beginning in early 2011, they commenced writing in a Massachusetts practice space together between touring for their last offering, For We Are Many. Coming off the road, the musicians hit the studio with longtime producer Adam D [The Devil Wears Prada, As I Lay Dying, Killswitch Engage] to record. As they cut the album\u2019s twelve tracks, one paramount goal loomed.\n\n\u201cWe just want to write good songs,\u201d admits Labonte. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be the heaviest or most technical band in the world. We\u2019re not trying to write math problems. We aim for balance. It\u2019s not about pleasing anyone or fitting into a scene. For us, it\u2019s always been about making music that\u2019s memorable and we would actually enjoy listening to it. That\u2019s the big point.\u201d\n\nThat point becomes proven tenfold on the anthemic first single, \u201cStand Up\u201d. From the scorching lead to the propulsive beat, it\u2019s an incendiary and infectious introduction to the record that\u2019s meant to be chanted along to.\n\n\u201cPeople can interpret it in many different ways,\u201d Labonte reveals of the song. \u201cIt\u2019s a little abstract. This band has never been about one style of music though. Any creative ideas are fair game, and everybody has input. We\u2019ve always pushed the boundaries of what we are, and we\u2019ll continue to do so.\u201d\n\nAt moments, A War You Cannot Win retreats into the warmth of Herbert\u2019s classically-infused acoustic instrumental \u201cCalculating Loneliness\u201d before reloading the thrash firepower of the politically-charged title track or the visceral stomp of \u201cDown Through the Ages\u201d. In other places like \u201cWhat If I Was Nothing\u201d and \u201cAsking Too Much\u201d\u2014self-proclaimed \u201cpining love songs\u201d\u2014the melody entwines with the lyrics, evincing tangible vulnerability. Most importantly, those vulnerable moments hit just as hard as the heavy ones in true All That Remains fashion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fortunate to be in a band with people who have such incredible ability,\u201d Labonte smiles. \u201cJason and Oli make everything musically interesting and complex. They\u2019re phenomenal. Mike and I add the pop metal aspect.\u201d\n\nAs far as the album title goes, it encapsulates a deeper meaning for the outspoken singer. \u201cI drew from a political perspective,\u201d he goes on. \u201cIt\u2019s an election year and the record drops Election Day, but it doesn\u2019t matter if you voted for one side or the other. It\u2019s still the same crap. The idea that the government can control someone\u2019s life is where A War You Cannot Win comes from. You can\u2019t go ahead and tell individuals what they can and cannot do. There will always be people who fight that power.\u201d\n\nAll That Remains has been fighting since day one. Granted, it hasn\u2019t been easy, but they\u2019ve had some very significant victories rising from the much-written about East Coast metal scene into an international phenomenon.\n\nTo date, they\u2019ve sold more than a million albums worldwide and 1.5 Million tracks over the course of Behind Silence and Solitude [2002], This Darkened Heart [2004], The Fall of Ideals [2006], Overcome [2008], and For We Are Many [2010]. For We Are Many actually debuted at #10 on the Billboard Top 200 and has moved over 180,000 copies.  At Active Rock Radio, they\u2019ve become a mainstay. \u201cThe Waiting One\u201d hit Top 5 on the Active Rock Radio chart, becoming their first-ever Top 5 single and fifth consecutive hit for the format. \u201cHold On\u201d and \u201cThe Last Time\u201d spent over a year charting as well. They\u2019ve destroyed stages worldwide with everyone from Asking Alexandria and Buckcherry to Hollywood Undead and Five Finger Death Punch as well as giving unforgettable performances at OZZfest and Download.\n\nUltimately though, it circles back to the fans for Labonte. \u201cThe most important thing is people can pull from the music what they want,\u201d he concludes of A War You Cannot Win. \u201cDo the songs reflect on you? Do they affect you? Do they inspire you somehow? Do they make you think? It\u2019s not about the person who wrote the song. The listener is the most important. If people are entertained by it and they think a little bit, we couldn\u2019t ask for anything more.\u201d\n\nAll That Remains definitely accomplish that mission on A War You Cannot Win.","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Metal","hometown":"Springfield, MA","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Kerri Brusca - kbrusca\u0040razorandtie.com","record_label":"Razor & Tie","talking_about_count":19722,"username":"allthatremains","website":"http:\/\/www.allthatremainsonline.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"20964523884","name":"All That Remains","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/allthatremains","likes":1601513,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151921611383885","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc1\/s720x720\/998960_10151921611383885_547123055_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"\"GRINNING STREAK\" available now on iTunes: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/iTunes.BNL & iTunes Canada: http:\/\/bit.ly\/10Krasy","band_members":"Jim Creeggan - vocals, bass \nEd Robertson - lead vocals, acoustic & electric guitars \nKevin Hearn - vocals, guitar, keyboards, accordian \nTyler Stewart - vocals, drums","bio":"Barenaked Ladies\n\nAmong the truths we hold to be self-evident are these: Canadian bands can play their asses off, and they can also bring the funny. No outfit hailing from north of the border embodies these paired virtues more engagingly than the Barenaked Ladies, whose fusion of hooks and yuks has resulted in more than 14 million albums sold, as well as putting myriad fannies in the seats of t\n\nOn the occasion of the band\u2019s 25th anniversary, BNL\u2014Ed Robertson (guitar\/vocals), Jim Creeggan (bass\/vocals), Kevin Hearn (keyboard\/guitar\/vocals) and Tyler Stewart (drums\/vocals)\u2014are celebrating with new album GRINNING STREAK. The album, the band's twelfth, is their first in partnership with Vanguard Records after self-releasing their last four efforts. \n\nAccording to the affable and articulate Robertson, the decision was a no-brainer. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the major label thing, we\u2019ve done the other extreme, and it was gratifying that Vanguard was interested in working with the band,\u201d he says. \u201cWe like to go with enthusiasm\u2014it\u2019s that simple. We know what we\u2019re capable of, but to have someone working for you and excited about it is really cool.\u201d\nThe album picks up steam via its hyper-hooky 1st single \u201cBoomerang,\u201d produced by Gavin Brown (The Tragically Hip, Metric), who handled 11 of GRINNING STREAK\u2019s 15 tracks. Another session with Toronto's Howie Beck (Feist, Walk of The Earth) yielded four album tracks: the buoyant \u201cWho Knew,\u201d the wistful \u201cSmile,\u201d the swirling \u201cOff His Head\u201d and the chugging \u201cBest Damn Friend.\u201d Rounding out the sessions is a Mark Endert (Maroon 5, Train) super-pop re-mix of \"Boomerang.\"\nReturning to Toronto in mid-March, the band banged out remainder of the songs with Brown. These remarkably productive final sessions yielded several stone-cold killers, paced by the quintessentially catchy \u201cOdds Are,\u201d which marries a wicked-clever mathematical premise to a chorus hook that elevates with such thrust that it practically leaves a vapor trail. BNL go EDM, so to speak, on \u201cLimits,\u201d as Robertson climbs atop an earth-shaking electro-groove to deliver a cautionary tale about the risks inherent in impulsively exceeding the metaphorical speed limit, while \u201cDid I Say That Out Loud?\u201d is a blast of romantic ardor fueled by \u201calcohol or alchemy\u201d that clocks in at a pulse-racing 2:27. All three are worthy additions to a canon already bursting at the seams with brainy, big-hearted classics.\n    \nIndeed, the whole of GRINNING STREAK unfolds with the signature blend of immediacy, tunefulness and witty sophistication that made such BNL hits as \u201cPinch Me, \u201cBrian Wilson,\u201d \u201cIf I Had $1,000,000\u201d and the chart-topping \u201cOne Week\u201d modern-day classics.\n\n\u201cPop is a form that I love\u2014it can be high-energy and intricate,\u201d says Robertson of the genre the band has championed throughout the last quarter century. \u201cWhen I think of pop music, I think of the Cars and Squeeze\u2014interesting melodic rock is what I gravitate to and what I\u2019m always striving for. I want guitar-heavy pop\/rock that\u2019s intelligent, evocative and thought-provoking. I want it to be singable and relatable, and I want there to be other layers in there for the people who want to go deeper\u2014because not everybody does. I\u2019ve heard so many times, \u2018I love you guys \u2019cause your songs are just fun and easygoing.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m glad you enjoy them, but there\u2019s a dark underbelly that you haven\u2019t mined.\u2019\u201d\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s much more to the Barenaked Ladies than initially meets the ear. Suck on the candy-coated surfaces of Robertson\u2019s songs long enough and you never know what you\u2019ll encounter in their \u201cemotional centers,\u201d as Robertson puts it. \n\nHe wrestled with the songs for the new album over an extended period as he plumbed the depths of his psyche in search of just those emotional centers. As the ideas steeped in his mind, Robertson experienced periods of stress, though not to the degree he\u2019d endured while writing the material for the band\u2019s previous studio album, 2010\u2019s All in Good Time. That one was their first project following the departure of Steven Page, who\u2019d founded the band with Robertson in 1988, reconfiguring the BNL as a four-piece.\n\n\u201cThis is the second record since all of that turmoil,\u201d Robertson notes, \u201cbut it\u2019s still a part of what we\u2019re going through and informs who we are. On the last record, there were some songs that were directly about the band split, but this record is much more about the emotional rebuilding after that process. Looking back on the maelstrom of all that upheaval, I wanted to convey a sense of hope, reconciliation and healing with these songs. \u2018Off His Head,\u2019 for example, is about pushing through difficulty. There\u2019s a double chorus at the end that I flipped, because I didn\u2019t want it to end with, \u2018Wishing you were dead.\u2019 That\u2019s part of being exasperated and at your wit\u2019s end. But what I like about this song is that it says you just do it. You think it\u2019s hopeless, but there\u2019s a reason you\u2019re pushing through it. The song says you can let all these things ruin you, or you can take it on the chin and stand up again.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoomerang\u201d metaphorically examines the aftermath of a breakup, but on a deeper level it recounts an impassioned interior dialogue.\u201cIt\u2019s a really personal song that says, \u2018You can be done with me, but I\u2019m not done with you,\u2019\u201d Robertson explains. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about feeling relevant\u2014because, as I started to approach this record, there was a period where I felt like I didn\u2019t know what to say and I didn\u2019t know who cared. But then I realized, y\u2019know, I care. I like what I do, I\u2019m a good songwriter and I\u2019m gonna write\u2014I\u2019m gonna express things. So that song is about getting your confidence back\u2014or, as one of my colleagues would say, getting your swagger back.\u201d\n\nOn the heels of the album\u2019s release, the Barenaked Ladies will embark on the latest iteration of the summer tours that formed such a big part of their enduring appeal. For this year\u2019s trek, which they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cLast Summer on Earth 2013,\u201d BNL are bringing along their pals and fellow pop\/rock mainstays Guster and the Ben Folds Five. The tour, which hits 30 amphitheaters and arenas, kicks off June17 at the Verizon Theatre in Dallas and concludes July 30 at Celebrate Brooklyn in the borough\u2019s Prospect Park. It includes dates at such picturesque venues as Denver\u2019s Red Rocks (6\/19), the Santa Barbara Bowl (6\/22), L.A.\u2019s Greek Theatre (6\/23), the Bangor (Maine) Waterfront (7\/21) and Lennox, Mass.\u2019 Tanglewood (7\/23).\n\n\u201cWe built our career playing summer outdoor shows,\u201d Robertson points out. \u201cTo be out there with a couple of other great bands bringing a lot of music to people\u2014hey, it\u2019s a nice way to spend the summer. After we put together the \u2018Last Summer on Earth\u201d tour last year, tongue firmly in cheek referencing the Mayan calendar, we thought it would be funny to just keep the \u2018Last Summer on Earth\u2019 thing going. Let\u2019s enjoy ourselves. Let\u2019s live like it is the last summer on earth. [Insert requisite rim shot here.] Let\u2019s party like it\u2019s 1999.\u201d\n\nhttp:\/\/barenakedladies.com","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"Toronto, Ontario, Canada","is_published":true,"record_label":"Vanguard Records","talking_about_count":3886,"username":"barenakedladies","website":"www.barenakedladies.com www.youtube.com\/bnlmusic www.bnlmusic.com\/store","were_here_count":0,"id":"12589090726","name":"Barenaked Ladies","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/barenakedladies","likes":399556,"cover":{"cover_id":"10153720242050727","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1450260_10153720242050727_1294546059_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"category":"Musician\/band","description":"The original discography of American guitarist and singer-songwriter Jimi Hendrix (including the Jimi Hendrix Experience) consists of three studio albums, two live albums, two compilation albums and twelve singles. In September 1966, ex-Animals bassist Chas Chandler brought Hendrix from the United States to the United Kingdom and an eponymous trio formed around him: Noel Redding became his bassist on 29 September and drummer Mitch Mitchell finalised the lineup on 6 October. The Experience's first single was a cover of Billy Roberts' \"Hey Joe\", released in the UK on 16 December and peaking at #6. The B side of that record was \"Stone Free\", written by Hendrix. Hendrix compositions \"Purple Haze\" and \"The Wind Cries Mary\" were released on 17 March and 5 May 1967, reaching #3 and #6 respectively. The band's debut LP, Are You Experienced, was released on Track Records on 12 May. It reached #2 in the UK; a version with a different track listing reached #5 in the US after its 23 August release on Reprise Records after Hendrix's Monterey Pop Festival performance in June. \"Hey Joe\" and \"Purple Haze\" were also released in the US; the latter peaked at #65. Hendrix's fourth single was \"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\", which later appeared on the Experience's third album. Unreleased in North America, it was the band's least-successful single to date and reached #18 in the UK. A Reprise single from Are You Experienced was released on 27 November: \"Foxy Lady\" peaked at #67, despite the album's success. Hendrix and the Experience were bound by their contract with Track to release at least two albums in 1967, and Axis: Bold as Love was released on 1 December. It was well-received, peaking at #5 in the UK and #3 after its US release on 15 January 1968. Axiss only single was unreleased in the UK: \"Up from the Skies\" reached #82 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

Big Sean officially signed to G.O.O.D Music in 2007 and then signed to Island Def Jam in 2008.","booking_agent":"mikebrinks\u0040gmail.com","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"mikebrinks\u0040gmail.com","hometown":"Detroit","is_published":true,"press_contact":"bigseanpromo\u0040gmail.com","record_label":"Island Def Jam\/G.O.O.D Music","talking_about_count":43455,"username":"uknowbigsean","website":"http:\/\/uknowbigsean.com http:\/\/youtube.com\/bseandon http:\/\/twitter.com\/BigSean ","were_here_count":0,"id":"40251166335","name":"BIG SEAN","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/uknowbigsean","likes":4092486,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151603528936336","source":"http:\/\/sphotos-g.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/s720x720\/563403_10151603528936336_1223020877_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":50}}

{"about":"OFFICIAL SITE:  http:\/\/www.DJShadow.com\/ ","band_members":"DJ Shadow","bio":"DJ Shadow (born Josh Davis) is widely credited as a key figure in developing the experimental instrumental hip-hop style associated with the London-based Mo' Wax label. Inspired by hip-hop's early years, he then grew to absorb the heyday of crews like Eric B. & Rakim, Ultramagnetic MCs, and Public Enemy; groups which prominently featured DJs in their ranks. \n\nJosh \"Shadow\" Davis had already been fiddling around with making beats and breaks on a four-track recorder while he was in high school in the NorCal cow-town of Davis, but it was during college that he co-founded his own Solesides label as an outlet for his original tracks. Hooking up with Davis' few b-boys (including eventual Solesides artists Blackalicious and Lyrics Born) through the college radio station, Shadow began releasing the Hip-Hop Reconstruction mix tapes in 1991 and pressed his 17-minute beat-head symphony \"Entropy\" in 1993. His tracks spread widely through the DJ-strong hip-hop underground, eventually catching the attention of Mo' Wax. \n\nShadow's first full-length, \"Endtroducing...\", was released in late 1996 to immense critical acclaim in Britain and America. \"Preemptive Strike,\" a compilation of early singles, followed in early 1998. Later that year, Shadow produced tracks for the debut album by U.N.K.L.E., a long-time Mo' Wax production team that gained superstar guests including Thom Yorke (of Radiohead), Richard Ashcroft (of the Verve), Mike D (of the Beastie Boys), and others.\n\nHis next project came in 1999, with the transformation of Solesides into a new label, Quannum Projects. Nearly six years after his debut production album, the proper follow-up, \"The Private Press,\" was released in June 2002. The following year Shadow released a mix album, \"Diminishing Returns,\" and in 2004 he released a live album and DVD, \"Live! In Tune and on Time.\" In 2006 he released another long awaited full-length album \"The Outsider,\" which featured rising Bay Area Hyphy rappers including Keak Da Sneak and E-40. \"The Outsider\" also featured a single with Q-Tip (of A Tribe Called Quest), which led to Shadow's first appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman. \n\nBetween 2007 and 2009 Shadow released three volumes of \"The 4-Track Era Collection,\" a series of his earliest recordings. The 4-Track Era project was exclusively available through his web store, ShopDjShadow.com. In the midst of all of these solo projects, DJ Shadow collaborated with fellow hip-hop DJ Cut Chemist. Together they created a series of mixes that fused soul, funk, and rock, in the framework of a cohesive concept involving using only 45 rpm records (7 inches). These mixes include Brainfreeze, Product Placement, and The Hard Sell, which would be debuted at the Hollywood Bowl.  \n\nShadow's website relaunched in August 2009, enabling him to sell digital downloads direct to his fans through his own autonomous storefront.  2009 also saw the announcement of Shadow's involvement with DJ Hero, an Activision video game which features Shadow as a playable character within the game.  Shadow also contributed several mixes to the game.     \n\n2010 and 2011 saw a tour throughout Europe and North America entitled \"Live From The Shadowsphere.\"\n\nIn 2011, DJ Shadow released \"The Less You Know, The Better,\" a much anticipated full-length studio album, which met massive acclaim.  2012 included Shadow's heralded \"All Basses Covered\" DJ set-tour, as well as \"Total Breakdown, Hidden Transmissions From The MPC Era (1992-1996),\" an archival project; and \"Reconstructed: Best of DJ Shadow,\" a greatest hits album.

{"about":"The Official Carrie Underwood Facebook Page","band_members":"Carrie Underwood\n\nWelcome to the official Carrie Underwood Facebook page managed by Arista Nashville.  This is Carrie's only account on Facebook.","bio":"With more than 15 million albums sold worldwide, 16 #1 singles, with seven as co-writes, five Grammys, and countless other accolades---all achieved with four albums in less than eight years---some artists might feel as though they\u2019d earned the right to rest on their laurels, but not Carrie Underwood. Fueled by a restless creative spirit, good-natured competitive streak and abundance of God-given talent, Carrie unleashes her most ambitious project yet with Blown Away.\n\nTeaming again with producer Mark Bright, Carrie delivers a 14-song collection that covers a particularly vast expanse of emotional territory. She celebrates the understated pleasures of small town living in \u201cThank God for Hometowns\u201d and explores the exquisite fragility of life in \u201cForever Changed.\u201d She\u2019s not averse to tackling abuse and betrayal then doling out a little sweet revenge with such compelling tracks as \u201cBlown Away\u201d and \u201cTwo Black Cadillacs.\u201d Musically the songs range from rollicking up-tempo anthems, such as the hit first single \u201cGood Girl\u201d to the island-flavored escape of \u201cOne Way Ticket\u201d and the steel guitar-laced country lament of \u201cWine After Whiskey.\u201d\n\nSuch musical and lyrical diversity is the foundation of Carrie\u2019s artistry. After all, this is a young woman who has performed with Steven Tyler on a top-rated edition of CMT\u2019s \u201cCrossroads,\u201d scored a No. 1 country hit with good friend Brad Paisley on \u201cRemind Me,\u201d and sang with the iconic Tony Bennett on the 2012 Grammy telecast, delivering the classic \u201cIt Had to be You,\u201d their collaboration on Bennett\u2019s Duets II album. \n   \nThe Oklahoma native is a fan of all types of music, yet she\u2019s purposefully planted herself in the country format, even while her eclectic tastes have influenced her creative output. She\u2019s been careful to not get pigeonholed and prides herself on not being predictable. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve taken all of my albums into as many different directions as possible while still keeping them cohesive,\u201d she says. \u201cI love this album from start to finish and love every song on it. There\u2019s not one single song that\u2019s like another song I\u2019ve ever done.  I think it\u2019s my best album.  I really do think there\u2019s something for everyone.\u201d\n\nHer ability to be unique yet accessible has been crucial to Carrie\u2019s career from the beginning.  She became America\u2019s sweetheart in 2005 when she won the fourth season of American Idol, a vehicle that transformed her from a shy Oklahoma girl with a great voice to a budding superstar. Since then she\u2019s become the popular franchise\u2019s most successful alumni. \n\nShe\u2019s won a vast array of awards including three female vocalist awards from both the Country Music Association (CMA) and the Academy of Country Music (ACM). In 2010, when Carrie garnered her second win as ACM Entertainer of the Year, she became the first female artist to win the award twice, and only the 7th female to take the award in the 40-year history of the ACM category, among Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Barbara Mandrell, Reba McEntire, Shania Twain, and the Dixie Chicks. Carrie also received the ACM Triple Crown Award, thanks to her past wins for the categories of Entertainer of the Year, Top Female Vocalist and Top New Female Vocalist, which has been won by only one other female artist \u2013 Barbara Mandrell in 2004. In addition to the above, Carrie\u2019s won 7 American Music Awards, 6 People\u2019s Choice Awards, 9 CMT Music Awards, 9 American Country Awards, and 7 BMI Songwriter Awards. Carrie also received a Golden Globe nomination in 2010 for \u201cBest Original Song\u201d for \u201cThere\u2019s A Place For Us\u201d from Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader which she both recorded and co-wrote.\n\nCarrie\u2019s 2005 debut Some Hearts topped Billboard\u2019s Country Albums chart for 27 weeks, has sold over 7 million copies, and was voted #1 Country Album of the Decade by Billboard. Both her 2007 sophomore album, Carnival Ride and 2009\u2019s Play On debuted at No. 1. Her current album, Blown Away, debuted atop the all-genre Billboard 200 chart, where it held the No. 1 spot for two consecutive weeks.  Over the course of four albums, she\u2019s saturated country radio with such hits as \u201cJesus, Take the Wheel,\u201d \u201cBefore He Cheats,\u201d \u201cSo Small,\u201d \u201cLast Name,\u201d \u201cJust A Dream,\u201d \u201cCowboy Casanova,\u201d \u201cTemporary Home,\u201d \u201cAll-American Girl,\u201d \u201cUndo It,\u201d \u201cMama\u2019s Song,\u201d \u201cGood Girl,\u201d and \u201cBlown Away.\u201d\n \nCarrie\u2019s highly acclaimed concert tours have further helped to establish her into the elite status of the country music community, or in any genre of music, with her stellar performances. In 2008, after wrapping her \u201cCarnival Ride Tour\u201d she became the top selling country female touring artist of the year selling out many of the 137 shows before 1.2 million fans. In that year, Carrie also became the most-heard artist at country radio and was named the #1 Hot Country Songs Artist by Billboard and #1 Top Country Artist by Radio & Records.  In 2010, her next headline arena tour, the \u201cPlay On Tour,\u201d played 108 shows with one million fans attending which resulted in Carrie being named again as the top-ranked female country touring artist of the year. Carrie is currently on her critically-acclaimed international \u201cBlown Away Tour\u201d, which began at London\u2019s historic Royal Albert Hall, and continued throughout Australia, before launching in North America in September of 2012.\n\nCarrie is a proud member of the Grand Ole Opry and expanded her resume making her acting debut in the 2011 film \u201cSoul Surfer.\u201d She can be seen in print and TV ads as the North American face of Olay beauty products, and has a long-running deal with   vitaminwater\u00ae. One of Country Music\u2019s most respected young ambassadors, Carrie has served as co-host of the CMA Awards with Brad Paisley the past five years.\n\nYet for those who think they know Carrie, Blown Away is likely to catch them by surprise, particularly the cinematic title track with its swirling, atmospheric production and intense lyric about abuse and revenge. \u201cI got chills,\u201d she says of the first time she heard the Josh Kear\/Chris Tompkins penned stunner.   \u201cI remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager and said, \u2018Do not let anyone else have this song. It\u2019s my song\u2019 . . . It\u2019s such a visual song.  You listen to it and you can see everything that is happening. It\u2019s so dramatic.  I\u2019m not a drama person, but when you can make a movie in song form in 3 \u00bd minutes, it\u2019s surreal.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlown Away\u201d finds a daughter getting revenge on an abusive, alcoholic father and the next song, \u201cTwo Black Cadillacs,\u201d also has a larger-than-life cinematic quality which makes both tunes feel like mini-movies set to music. \u201cTwo Black Cadillacs\u201d relates the story of a wife and mistress who conspire to get even with the man who betrayed them both. \u201cIt\u2019s just more drama,\u201d says Carrie, who co-wrote the tune with Josh Kear and Hillary Lindsey. \u201cIt was so much fun creating all this drama and singing about it. That\u2019s the great thing about being an entertainer; you\u2019re just a big actor. When we start sitting down and writing songs, you just never know what\u2019s going to come out.\u201d\n\nCarrie co-wrote eight of the 14 songs on Blown Away, including the first single, Good Girl\" which reached number 1 on the country airplay charts and is certified platinum. \u2018Good Girl\u2019 was one of the last ones I wrote for the album,\u201d she says of the tune she penned with Chris DeStefano and Ashley Gorley. \u201cWe wanted something a little more fun and up-tempo. Chris DeStefano is just a mad scientist with his Pro Tools and he can play every instrument.  We walked out of that writing session with a demo. It sounded awesome. It was ready to go. We let everybody hear it and everybody was so excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cCupid\u2019s Got a Shotgun\u201d is another of the album\u2019s high-energy tracks and it gets an extra kick from Paisley contributing his signature guitar licks. \u201cOnce we got into the studio, I was like Brad Paisley HAS to play on this. He\u2019ll make the song,\u201d Carrie says of the tune, she wrote with Kear and Tompkins. \u201cWe left so much space in the song for him to come in and play. He did his thing and sounded awesome. He added that last piece of the puzzle and it\u2019s just so country.  It\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nIn addition to being musically inventive, Carrie has long been known for delivering songs with substance, and the new album delivers its share of potent messages. \u201cNobody Ever Told You,\u201d which Carrie wrote with Luke Laird and Hillary Lindsey, boasts an empowering lyric and a breezy, engaging melody. \u201cPeople need to hear compliments more,\u201d she says of the song\u2019s life-affirming lyric. \u201cPeople need to hear \u2018I love you\u2019 more. People need to hear \u2018You are beautiful\u2019 more.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood in Goodbye,\u201d co-written by Carrie, Lindsey and Ryan Tedder, is a bittersweet look at life beyond heartbreak that offers tender truth in the lines \u201cAs bad as it was\/As bad as it hurt\/I thank God I didn\u2019t get what I thought I deserved.\u201d  On the other end of the emotional spectrum, \u201cThank God for Hometowns\u201d is a sweet salute to small town life. \u201cI heard that one when I was going back to my 10 year high school reunion,\u201d the Checotah, OK native says. \u201cI listened to the demo when I was driving in to go stay with my parents. It was just very fitting in my heart at that time.\u201d \n\n\u201cForever Changed\u201d is a beautiful ballad that brings tears to Carrie\u2019s eyes as she discusses it. \u201cI had a hard time recording it and I still have a hard time listening to it,\u201d she says of the Tom Douglas\/Hillary Lindsey\/James T. Slater penned ballad. \u201cThat is the most wonderfully well written song I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. There\u2019s this young girl meeting the love of her life, getting married and having a baby. It takes you back in time and there is something old fashioned about it. At the end, the mom\u2019s obviously slipping a way a little bit. It is a sad song, but it\u2019s not meant to be a sad song. It\u2019s about love, being forever changed, forever loved.\u201d\n\nIn a few short years, Carrie has seen the power music has to change lives---to incite dialog, to instill hope, and to simply entertain. She\u2019s aware of the platform she\u2019s been given. She respects it and appreciates every moment. \u201cI\u2019m very happy in my life and I count my blessings every day,\u201d she says. \u201cSeven years ago when I decided to try out for American Idol, my life changed completely in the blink of an eye. I went down a different train track and took off at about a million miles per hour. I feel like I\u2019m still learning. In the beginning, it was like, \u2018Oh, I have a No. 1. That\u2019s awesome!\u2019 I didn\u2019t really understand what that meant. \u2018Jesus, Take The Wheel\u2019 and \u2018Before He Cheats\u2019 were No. 1 for several weeks, and that doesn\u2019t happen often, but I had no idea. I realize now what hard work it actually is and I feel like I can appreciate those victories even more. Touring is more fun because I know what it\u2019s like to headline a tour. I feel like I\u2019m able to be more and more creative all the time. I always feel like I\u2019m taking steps forward.\u201d ","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Country","hometown":"Checotah, OK","is_published":true,"record_label":"Arista Nashville","talking_about_count":360886,"username":"carrieunderwood","website":"carrieunderwoodofficial.com ","were_here_count":0,"id":"5240049567","name":"Carrie Underwood","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/carrieunderwood","likes":9735991,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152016645914568","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1456544_10152016645914568_1224094317_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"category":"Musician\/band","description":"John Paul Larkin , better known by his stage name Scatman John, was an American musician who created a fusion of scat singing and dance music, best known for his 1995 hits \"Scatman \" and \"Scatman's World\".A stutterer, Larkin stated that scatting was \"turning my biggest problem into my biggest asset\". Scatman John sold millions of recordings worldwide and was named \"Best New Artist\" in the Echo Awards in both Japan and Germany. He was a recipient of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's Annie Glenn Award for outstanding service to the stuttering community and National Stuttering Association Hall of Fame.BiographyBorn in El Monte, California, Larkin suffered from a severe stutter since his beginning of speech which led to an emotionally traumatic childhood. Even at the peak of his success in 1995, journalists reported that during interviews he \u201chardly finishes a sentence without repeating the phrase at least six or seven times.\u201d At age twelve he began to learn piano, and was introduced to the art of scat singing at the age of fourteen through records by Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, amongst others. The piano provided him with a means of artistic expression to compensate for his speech difficulties.

{"about":"Download Daughtry's latest hit single - \"Waiting for Superman\" - at http:\/\/www.daughtryofficial.com\/us\/superman","band_members":"Chris Daughtry - Vocals\nJosh Paul - Bass\nBrian Craddock - Guitar\nJosh Steely - Guitar\nRobin Diaz - Drums","bio":"In the course of only five years, Chris Daughtry has had more than his share of career highlights. The singer, songwriter, and musician from North Carolina has released back-to-back No. 1 albums, the 4x-platinum DAUGHTRY (which became the fastest-selling rock debut in Soundscan history) and 2009\u2019s platinum Leave This Town. DAUGHTRY has scored four No. 1 Top 40 hits (\u201cIt\u2019s Not Over, \u201cHome,\u201d \u201cFeels Like Tonight,\u201d and \u201cNo Surprise\u201d), earned four Grammy Award nominations (including \u201cBest Rock Album\u201d for DAUGHTRY), won four American Music Awards, and brought its electrifying live show to all corners of the world, including sold-out arenas in South Africa, Singapore, and The Philippines. \n\nSo when it came time to record their third album, Break the Spell, it would have been understandable if Chris and the band \u2014 which includes guitarists Josh Steely and Brian Craddock, bassist Josh Paul, and drummer Robin Diaz \u2014 decided to stick to what they knew worked. Thing is, that\u2019s not how they work. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make the same record,\u201d Chris says of how he felt before the band hit the studio in March 2011 with long-time producer Howard Benson. \u201cHoward called me and said he had some ideas for what we needed to do to differentiate this album. He said, \u2018I really think we need to push ourselves.\u2019 He was blown away by the songs we had sent over, which is very hard to do with that guy, so everything was really positive out of the gate.\u201d \n\nThe result is Break the Spell \u2014 a gleaming showcase for Chris\u2019s powerful, emotionally resonant voice and knack for relentless melodic hooks and big, anthemic choruses. The album enables the band to evolve musically while aiming to satisfy its many long-time fans. \u201cGoing in to the writing sessions, we said, \u2018Let\u2019s not try to sound like anything. Let's just write, and see what happens,\u2019\u201d says Chris, who co-wrote every song with either one of his band-mates or such collaborators as Marti Frederiksen, Busbee, and Brett James. \u201cWe came up with some pretty interesting tunes that sound nothing like anything we've done before. Even though some of them didn\u2019t make the album, the process stretched us and took us to new places. It was the first time I\u2019ve said, \u2018It doesn't sound like us, but I can see us doing that.\u2019\" \n\nYou can hear their risk-taking on such primal, slithering rockers as hard-driving first single \u201cCrawing Back To You,\u201d \u201cOutta My Head,\u201d and \u201cRenegade,\u201d which Entertainment Weekly praised for its \u201cwind-in-your-eyes hook and leather-glove-to-the-sky chorus\u201d calling it \u201cthe ideal soundtrack for hitting the highway.\u201d The songs reflect the confident swagger of some of Chris\u2019 favorite bands. \u201cI was listening to a lot of old Aerosmith and Def Leppard and I wanted to make a rock record that that was really upbeat and hard-hitting,\u201d Chris says. \u201cThere were a couple of tracks on Leave This Town that were heavy, but as a whole, the album was very polished. Break the Spell is more fist-pumping, if you will. I wouldn\u2019t say the songs are stripped-down, but they have a bit more room to breathe.\u201d \n\nThat extra space has the effect of allowing the words to shine more brightly, which became important to Chris when he realized that some of the songs had gone deeper lyrically than anything he had written to date. The birth of his twins in November 2010 \u201cdefinitely sparked something in me,\u201d he says, and led to such moving ballads as \u201cGone Too Soon.\u201d At one point during the writing session, Chris had to walk out to collect himself. \u201cThe song is about realizing that today could have been the day that someone would be blowing out the candles,\u201d Chris says. \u201cIt just hit me pretty hard. I remember playing the demo for my brother and I turned around and he was bawling. I didn't realize that my brother\u2019s wife had suffered a miscarriage years before. It was a pretty emotional moment.\u201d \n\n\u201cGone Too Soon\u201d may be the album\u2019s most intense moment, but Break the Spell is not a brooding affair, nor is it preoccupied with people going their separate ways \u2014 further evidence that Chris has ventured out of his comfort zone. \u201cThat ship has sailed,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to do something that was a little more charming in the lyrical take, so I started reflecting on when I met my wife as opposed to dwelling on the hard times. I was trying to tap into all of the spontaneous things you do when everything's new and perfect and you\u2019re trying to impress someone. I\u2019d never really written about that. Even \u2018Crawling Back To You\u2019 is a different take on the \u2018Sorry, I screwed-up story\u2019 in that it\u2019s about how I\u2019m doing exactly what you said I\u2019d do, I\u2019m crawling back.\u201d \n\nOverall, Chris feels that Break The Spell, which is being released five years from the day that DAUGHTRY\u2019S debut was released, is the most uplifting and hopeful album the band has recorded. \u201cIt\u2019s not so dark,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not only singing about the bad days. And with many of the songs being up-tempo, it\u2019s going to really fun to play live.\u201d \n\nLive, of course, is where DAUGHTRY really shines. This band has always made its bones on stage and the coming year will be no exception as they hit the road to support Break the Spell. \u201cBon Jovi, U2, and Aerosmith are certainly big influences on us musically and just seeing how they can still go out and play for the masses after all these years is really inspiring,\u201d Chris says. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, we didn't set out to do this to play clubs. No rock band ever sets out saying they want to play clubs for the rest of their career. If they do, they're full of it. I want to play arenas. I would love to play stadiums. This album is a step in the right direction.\u201d","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"Roanoke Rapids, NC","is_published":true,"record_label":"RCA Records","talking_about_count":162635,"username":"daughtry","website":"http:\/\/www.daughtryofficial.com http:\/\/www.myplaydirect.com\/daughtry\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"6299270457","name":"Daughtry","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/daughtry","likes":3710484,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151738896210458","source":"http:\/\/sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/s720x720\/995762_10151738896210458_1155177077_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

The the line up, after a couple of adjustments, established itself with Daltrey on lead vocals,  Keith Moon on drums, John Entwistle on bass and Pete Townshend on lead guitar. Townshend, honouring his art student credentials, wrote (and still writes) music famous for having an \u2018edge\u2019, complemented by the wildly creative performance techniques of each member of the band. \n\nIt is generally acknowledged among rock aficionados that The Who in their heyday were the most exciting live band on the planet, with their Live at Leeds album (1970) hailed as the greatest live album of all time. The compositional skills of Townshend have always been way beyond the conventional, as is proven not only in classic songs like \u2018My Generation\u2019 and \u2018Baba O\u2019Riley\u2019 but also in his two great rock operas (a form he more or less invented single-handed) Tommy and Quadrophenia.  \n\nToday, despite the deaths of Keith Moon and John Entwistle, The Who remain a potent force on the rock music scene.

The band as it was at the time consisted of Jesper, Johan Larsson and Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m. A demo was recorded and soon after the band got a record deal and released \u201cLunar Strain\u201d and it did not take long before the album was a classic in the fast growing Scandinavian death metal scene. \n\nWith a new line up consisting of Jesper, Johan & Glenn along with two new additions: Anders Frid\u00e9n on vocals and Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte on drums, In Flames signed a license deal with Nuclear Blast Records and soon started recording the follow up: \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d. \n\n\u201cThe Jester Race\u201d quickly became a big hit all across Europe and Japan. After the recording of \u201cWhoracle\u201d in 1997 Johan and Glenn decided to leave the band and Peter Iwers (bass) joined. Niklas Engelin (Gardenian, Engel) was temporarily in the band filling in on guitars. \n\nWith a fresh line up the band set sails and headed out on tour. Short after a very successful European tour Niklas had to focus on his other projects, and Bj\u00f6rn switched from drums to guitar and Daniel Svensson joined the band, and this is the In Flames as we know it today. With the completion of the line up \u201cColony\u201d was recorded and released in 1999. \n\n\u201cColony\u201d took In Flames to a new level and the band sold out venues across Europe, USA and Japan and quickly became one of the biggest and most popular Melodic Death Metal acts around. \n\n\u201cClayman\u201d which was released in 2000 even topped its predecessor and the awards started pouring in and the band kept growing in popularity. In 2001 \u201cThe Tokyo Showdown\u201d, In Flames first live album was released, and gave the public and insight to the band\u2019s live competence. \n\nModern and more mature \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d (2002) again confirmed the status of In Flames and marked another milestone in their career. Two years later and it was time to take In Flames to a new level. \u201cSoundtrack To Your Escape\u201d did just that and was the logical continuation after \u201cReroute To Remain\u201d. In Flames continued to tour the world and documented these escapades, which resulted in the release of the phenomenal DVD\/CD package \u201cUsed And Abused \u2013 In Live We Trust\u201d in 2005. \n\nWith an incredibly successful world tour behind them, In Flames recorded the masterpiece \u201cCome Clarity\u201d which was released in March 2006. \u201cCome Clarity\u201d got an amazing reception in the media and has today sold over 400.000 copies worldwide. The song \u201cTake This Life\u201d from the album is featured on the \u201cGuitar Hero III\u201d game. A game which has been deemed the bestselling video game of all times and has today sold six million copies. \n\nIn Flames have sold over 2,5 million albums worldwide to date! \n\nIn January 2010, Jesper Str\u00f6mblad left the band, and was replaced by Niclas Engelin.\n","booking_agent":"The Agency Group; LONDON: Paul Ryan MALM\u00d6: Tobbe Lorentz NEW YORK: Tim Borror","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Gothenburg, Sweden","genre":"Metal","hometown":"Gothenburg, SWEDEN","is_published":true,"press_contact":"pr\u0040inflames.com","record_label":"-","talking_about_count":21916,"username":"inflames","website":"www.inflames.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"134855083229926","name":"In Flames(Official)","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/inflames","likes":1062141,"cover":{"cover_id":542882432427187,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1170882_542882432427187_336454238_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":50}}

{"about":"\u0040MariahCarey","bio":"Mariah Carey is the best-selling female artist of all time with more than 200 million albums sold to date and eighteen Billboard #1 singles (seventeen self-penned), more than any solo artist in history. With her distinct five-octave vocal range, prolific songwriting, and producing talent, Carey has defined the modern pop performance. As a singer\/songwriter\/producer, she has been recognized with five Grammy Awards, nine American Music Awards, Billboard\u2019s \u201cArtist of the Decade\u201d Award,  the World Music Award for \u201cWorld\u2019s Best Selling Female Artist of the Millennium,\u201d and BMI\u2019s \u201cIcon Award\u201d for her outstanding achievements in songwriting, to name a few.\n\nMariah Carey exploded upon the scene with the debut of her self-titled album in 1990, combining angelic allure and a vocal intensity never heard before. The critically acclaimed album spawned an extraordinary four #1 singles. Carey continued her early success with a series of hit singles from her subsequent albums; Emotions (1991) and MTV Unplugged (1992) that would secure her place at the top of the charts and pop culture.\n\nWith the release of Music Box (1993), Carey produced her most commercially successful album selling an astounding 30 million units. In 1994, Carey released the classic holiday album, Merry Christmas which features her original timeless holiday hit \u201cAll I want for Christmas is you.\u201d In 1995, Mariah became the second artist in history and the first female performer to have a song debut at #1 with the smash single, \u201cFantasy\u201d off her hit album, Daydream. \"Fantasy\" helped define a new genre of music with the surprising hit collaboration with rap group Wu-Tang Clan's O.D.B. She produced a second #1 debut single off Daydream with the Boyz II Men collaboration \u201cOne sweet day\u201d which subsequently became the 90's song of the decade. She followed with the hip-hop and R&B-infused Butterfly (1997), a natural progression to \"Daydream\", which introduced a new chapter in her career and life, again working with the hottest names in the music business including Sean Combs and Missy Elliott.\n\nIn 1998, eight years after her debut, Carey released #1\u2019s, a compilation of her chart-topping hits. The album also included a new song, \u201cWhen You Believe\u201d (from the Dreamworks film, The Prince of Egypt), a duet with Whitney Houston that paired two of the most successful female recording artists in pop history. The song went on to win the 1999 Academy Award for \u201cbest original song.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeartbreaker,\u201d the first single off of her landmark album, Rainbow (1999) led Carey to become \u201cthe first artist to top the charts in each year of the 1990s.\u201d Consequently, the record also pushed her ahead of The Beatles as the artist with the most cumulative weeks spent atop the Hot 100 singles chart. Mariah Carey subsequently sparked the interest of Universal Music Group\u2019s Island Def Jam Records, which signed her to an exclusive recording contract in May 2002. Later that year, she made her label debut with the release of the multi-platinum Charmbracelet.\n\nEvoking a nickname used by those closest to her, The Emancipation of Mimi marked Mariah Carey\u2019s tenth studio album with its release in April of 2005. The album, which features Billboard song of the decade, \u201cWe belong together\u201d earned three Grammys following a string of wins at the Vibe Awards, the American Music Awards and Billboard Music Awards. Mimi was the biggest selling album of the year.\n\nIn 2008, the first single off E=MC \u00b2, \u201cTouch my body\u201d became Mariah's 18th Billboard #1 single, surpassing the longstanding record for most #1 singles by a solo artist, held by Elvis Presley with 17. To celebrate this monumental achievement, the world famous Empire State building lit the tower in Mariah\u2019s favorite colors, pink yet lavender.\n\nIn the thirteen songs on her spellbinding album, Memoirs of an imperfect Angel, released in 2009, Mariah explored the aspects of our shared humanity with a rare depth, honesty and open-heartedness: it\u2019s one of the strongest statements in her long, distinguished career. With just one exception, Carey wrote and produced the entire album in collaboration with The-Dream and Tricky Stewart. Mariah scored another #1 club hit with \"Obsessed,\" the lead single from Memoirs. The video, directed by Brett Ratner was a huge success and a comedic triumph.\n\nMerry Christmas II You, Mariah\u2019s thirteenth studio album and second holiday album was released in November 2010. In addition to traditional yuletide, Merry Christmas II You also contained original songs composed by Mariah, \u201cOh Santa!\u201d and \u201cAll I Want For Christmas Is You\u201d among them. Merry Christmas II You made chart history when Mariah became the first artist to claim the top two spots on Billboard\u2019s Holiday Digital Songs chart, \u201cOh Santa!\u201d debuting at #1, in front of the new recording of her all-time standard, \u201cAll I Want For Christmas Is You\u201d at #2. Mariah rounded out her chart-topping success with a # 1 debut on Billboard\u2019s R&B\/Hip-Hop albums Chart.\n\nMariah Carey's ongoing impact transcends the music industry to leave an indelible imprint upon the world at large. Recently, she\u2019s made a substantial mark in film with her critically acclaimed role as a social worker inPrecious, the 2009 film based on the novelPush by Sapphire.  A Congressional Award recipient, Carey  has generously donated her time and energy to a range of philanthropic causes near to her heart including Save the Music, The Make-A-Wish Foundation, World Hunger Relief, and the Elton John Aids Foundation, among many others. A tremendous supporter of children\u2019s charities, both domestic and international, Mariah Carey, in partnership with the Fresh Air Fund founded Camp Mariah, a retreat for inner city children to explore career development.\n\nMariah is currently in the studio, writing, recording and executive-producing her next album for Island Def Jam Music Group with the lead single \"Triumphant.\"  Carey also made worldwide headlines this summer with the exciting news that she will join the judges\u2019 panel of FOX\u2019s American Idol when the series returns in 2013.","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Pop\/R&B","hometown":"New York, New York","is_published":true,"record_label":"Island","talking_about_count":910839,"username":"mariahcarey","website":"http:\/\/www.mariahcarey.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"6162457765","name":"Mariah Carey","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mariahcarey","likes":15101469,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152046003517766","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1460015_10152046003517766_165930364_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"\u00d8 (Disambiguation) out now! Twitter: http:\/\/bit.ly\/uotwit","band_members":"Spencer Chamberlain: vocals\nDaniel Davison: drums\nTimothy McTague: guitar\nJames Smith: guitar\nGrant Brandell: bass\nChristopher Dudley: keyboards ","bio":"For the six men in UNDEROATH, whose members have evolved and thrived during a decade-long progression that has elevated them into one of heavy music\u2019s biggest successes, change has been ubiquitous. 2010 has been no exception for the Tampa-based sextet, who underwent and overcame what many consider their most significant line-up alteration yet. Yet in doing so, UNDEROATH experienced an artistic rebirth in the form of \u00d8 (DISAMBIGUATION), its triumphant fifth album for Solid State\/Tooth & Nail. Transformed by the arrival of new drummer DANIEL DAVISON, formerly of Norma Jean, UNDEROATH--which also counts TIM MCTAGUE, SPENCER CHAMBERLAIN, GRANT BRANDELL, CHRIS DUDLEY and JAMES SMITH--has delivered an album that emphatically surpasses its predecessors in terms of craftsmanship and cohesion. If 2006\u2019s Define The Great Line and 2008\u2019s Lost In The Sound of Separation, both which debuted at #2 and #8 respectively on Billboard\u2019s Top 200 Album Chart, were significant accomplishments, \u00d8 (disambiguation) is UNDEROATH\u2019s new creative high watermark. .... \u201cWe all think it\u2019s our best record by far,\u201d says frontman SPENCER CHAMBERLAIN of the band\u2019s brilliant new disc. \u201cI\u2019d say to fans that you may have heard UNDEROATH, but you\u2019ve never heard UNDEROATH like this. We can\u2019t wait for people to hear it. There isn\u2019t a single part on this record that we would change.\u201d Be it the commanding opener, \u201cIn Division\u201d \u2013 which balances the cathartic approach that has made UNDEROATH champions of hard music with an exhilarating melodic hook \u2013 or the expansive, inventive allure of \u201cCatch Myself Catching Myself,\u201d the Matt Goldman and Jeremy SH Griffith-produced \u00d8 (disambiguation) asserts that the departure of longtime drummer\/singer Aaron Gillespie hasn\u2019t hurt the band. In fact, the line-up shift has instead strengthened the band\u2019s resolve and liberated UNDEROATH. Most notably, SPENCER \u2013 who provided much of the singing and screaming vocals heard on Lost In The Sound of Separation \u2013 has embraced his role as the band\u2019s lone singer, while bringing an ample supply of melody to \u00d8 (disambiguation). \u201cWe\u2019ve never been afraid of singing, but the big poppy choruses are gone,\u201d says MCTAGUE. \u201cThis record has a lot more of a mature feeling. It wasn\u2019t that we hated melody, but we wanted it to be a proper fit.\u201d For CHAMBERLAIN, being the only singer in UNDEROATH feels and sounds more natural. \u201cIt\u2019s never been in my personal taste to have two people interchanging vocals, so I wrote my vocals on the album for just one,\u201d SPENCER explains. \u201cIt sounds less forced to me, plus it\u2019s in the same voice. I made a conscious effort to make it interconnected. I enjoy singing, but before it felt like I couldn\u2019t write a part and deliver it because of the inner workings of the band. Now there are no rules. I have the full creative freedom to deliver the song, whether its singing or screaming, the way I want to.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t just Spencer, the rest of the band felt unfettered during the crafting of \u00d8 (disambiguation). \u201cWe let down our guard on everything with this record and just trusted one another,\u201d TIM says. \u201cWe all wanted the same thing, no restraints. More than any other record we\u2019ve made, this one came together more naturally. And ironically, we wound up with more melodic parts than ever before, but things weren\u2019t so calculated.\u201d Without confines, UNDEROATH arrived at atmospheric numbers like \u201cDriftwood\u201d and \u201cPaper Lung,\u201d two of the band\u2019s most forward-thinking pieces yet, with little hesitation. The former, according to TIM, is inspired by Radiohead. \u201cIt\u2019s our homage to the band. We embraced it and went were the song took us.\u201d If that sounds like a radical shift, to hear it is to know it makes perfect sense with the pacing of \u00d8 (disambiguation). Meanwhile, SPENCER cites the aforementioned \u201cPaper Lung\u201d as his personal favorite on the record. \u201cFor me, it has a classic Deftones feel. It\u2019s still dark and heavy but there\u2019s a melody driving it. Big choruses, guitars, quirky keyboard touches. I love it.\u201d But that\u2019s not to say that the sonic fists that fans have come to know are being edged out, as evidenced by the fast punk-inspired charge of \u201cVacant Mouth,\u201d the irate, unforgiving \u201cReversal,\u201d the maniacal feel of \u201cIlluminator\u201d and the vicious, mind-bending \u201cWho Will Guard The Guardians.\u201d. As for DAVISON\u2019s entry, CHAMBERLAIN and MCTAGUE both herald the drummer as a key element in UNDEROATH\u2019s ability to move forward. \u201cThe first person we considered was DANIEL,\u201d says TIM, who first befriended the drummer ten years ago when his band shared Southeastern stages with Norma Jean. \u201cAnd he came down to play with us and things just clicked quickly and easily. There was no hesitation, he immediately fit in. After three weeks of writing with DANIEL, we committed to do the new record on time and as planned. That spawned us into working every night, from 5 o\u2019clock until 1 or 2AM the next morning. Playing for six to eight hours.\u201d \u201cWriting with someone new, was invigorating,\u201d says SPENCER of DANIEL, who has since become a permanent member of UNDEROATH. \u201cDrums play a huge part in UNDEROATH, and I think Daniel just killed it. He destroyed everything in his path when it came to writing and playing. It\u2019s been such a smooth and positive transition. It feels natural now.\u201d Working again with Goldman, who co-produced Lost In The Sound of Separation, and teaming with Griffith \u2013 who helmed Norma Jean\u2019s most recent album, UNDEROATH assessed what it had done in the past and ultimately sought to convey a similarly organic feel on the record. \u201cWhen we felt the record taking shape, we sat with it for awhile--we looked at the songs and our past releases and compared the production,\u201d says MCTAGUE. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking to go down the same road. Our last couple of records were super-produced and edited. Matt and Jeremy are both vibe oriented and helped us get where we needed to go.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff on this record that some might consider it loose, but for us it\u2019s got little imperfections, like we all do as human beings,\u201d MCTAGUE adds. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s probably closer to the live UNDEROATH experience. The nuances that give it a little bit of life and character are present and we really embraced that. A lot of the drum stuff for instance happened in one or two takes.\u201d MCTAGUE continues, \u201cThis record feels more natural because it\u2019s a lot more sequential whereas our last record was more piece by piece. It\u2019s a lot closer to our live experience rather than a flawless, computerized project.\u201d In that sense, \u00d8 (disambiguation) lives up to its meaning. It\u2019s an album that speaks for itself as it provides clarity about a band that has experienced its share of misinterpretation. \u201cWe want this record to set the record straight and it will,\u201d SPENCER concludes. \u201cIt\u2019s presented exactly the way we want it. And when we play it live it will show that UNDEROATH is, as it always was, the sum of its parts. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of this record and happier with where we are as a band.\u201d","booking_agent":"Tim Borror","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Tampa, FL","general_manager":"Randy Nichols","hometown":"Tampa, FL","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Blacklodge PR jeffb\u0040blacklodgepr.com","record_label":"Tooth & Nail \/ Solid State Records","talking_about_count":1821,"username":"underoath","website":"www.underoath777.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"18974623008","name":"Underoath","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/underoath","likes":1468252,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152045926723009","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/944133_10152045926723009_1634053346_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":50}}

The genre was forever and irrefutably changed by what the band has done. \n\nBy the mid-00s, there was a full metal Renaissance, if you will, in America, with the genre enjoying several years of renewed success and critical respect. Lamb of God worked to establish themselves without question as the scene's alpha males, dominating at every turn, leaving a parade of other acts to merely feast on their leftovers and scraps. Mind you, this was not a scene, style or era populated by middling acts. The era was filled quality bands and still, it was Lamb of God who defined the time period and that quickly ascended as the game changers and torch bearers. No. Questions. Asked.\n\nTurns out, they've merely nicked the surface of what they can do and plan on accomplishing.\n\nIn 2012, Lamb of God remain the pre-eminent metal band and not by default, either. The scene is still healthy, even if some of the peers who stood shoulder-to-shoulder with them during that period of growth have fallen by the wayside. Lamb of God still reign atop of the genre thanks to their consistent ability to feed fans with only the best extreme metal there is. Their seventh album Resolution finds the band firing on all cylinders and doing things their way. As if we'd expect anything less from this Virginia wrecking crew.\n\nWith a rich history including three Grammy nominations, an invitation to tour with Metallica (which they did in 2008 through 2010 on the World Magnetic trek);  multiple debuts in the Top 10 on the Billboard Top 200 (2009's Wrath debuted at No. 2 while 2006's Sacrament debuted at No. 8); multiple Platinum-selling DVDs (Killadelphia and Walk With Me in Hell); an arena tour with Slipknot (which took place in 2005); the main stage of OZZfest (2006) and wearing the fact that they were banned in Los Angeles (the Forum had a problem with their name and booted them off the bill of two shows, one with Slipknot and one with Metallica) as a badge of honor, there's no question that Lamb of God rule the metal roost. Everyone else is left to watch and marvel, and choke on their dust. However, they're not resting on past successes or what they've done. For Lamb of God, what happened in 2002 happened in 2002. It's about the right now and what's next: Resolution. \n\nWith Resolution, Lamb of God emerged from their haven in the South as powerful, as hungry and as extreme as ever. While most bands are running on fumes or coasting and sputtering to album No. 7, Lamb of God are reinvigorated. They still have something to say and more to prove\u2026to themselves and no one else. This sonic terror squad has come along way from playing squats in basements as Burn the Priest with one constant element:  the instinct to make legit, honest music their way, which is just what they've done with Resolution.  \n \n\u201cThe first and foremost thing that you have to realize about LOG is that we do exactly what we want, when we want, and how we want to,\" declares vocalist Randy Blythe. \"We always have and we always will. That\u2019s why each record is a snapshot in time. We never consciously sit down and say 'We\u2019re going to keep it heavy. We\u2019re going to keep it metal.' We just do that because that\u2019s what we want to do. If we felt like putting out a polka record tomorrow, we would. We\u2019re trying to make 'smart' heavy music.\u201d \n\nPoint taken and mission most certainly accomplished with Resolution, a 100 percent trend-free and intelligently constructed album that could power a small country with its unstoppable energy and potent riffery. In a scene littered with \"here today, gone tomorrow\" bands, Lamb of God have survived because nothing stops them from staying the course they've purposely chosen to embark upon. They're not here to collect a check or respond to a label exec's request to pen a \"radio song.\" It's none of the above for Lamb of God. The men that comprise the band are a little older now, a lot wiser and have families to support. Yet despite all those realities, making this music and making it their way is something that compels them, drives them and sustains them.  \n\n\u201cYou can still be a band that goes to the practice space, actually writes music together and then records. Being an actual band is still a viable option,\" Blythe says. \"Bands are disappearing with digital recording today. Things are progressing to the point where people are just playing a riff or pattern and programming the drums, and at the end of the day, they have a technically perfect record, but it isn\u2019t a real record. We didn\u2019t do that. Our record is a REAL record.\u201d Indeed, there is blood and adrenaline coursing through every vein of Resolution and its pulse will be felt by all who listen. It's an incredibly human record.\n\n\"We're not spitting out a Lamb of God template record,\" guitarist Mark Morton says. \"If it's uninspired or you have nothing left to say, you stop. We're all putting other things in life off to do this, and we're not going to do it if gets boring to us. It's still exciting on our seventh studio record. We're still gaining momentum and getting better.\" That's not a quality you come across often with aggressive bands. Playing physically taxing music at full tilt leads to wear and tear on the body and the mind, but Lamb of God are not affected by such issues. They're like mutants made stronger by challenging themselves. While 2009's Wrath was sonically forceful enough to shift tectonic plates, Resolution finds the band knocking out their songs with the signature groove and swagger that made them heir apparent to Pantera's throne --an accolade left at LOG's doorstep by critics over time-- but with a little more refinement and attention to dynamics.\n\nOverall, Morton feels that Resolution is the natural next chapter in his band's history, albeit one that harks back to the past, saying, \"It almost completes the circle. There is a purity in the music, like when you first begin and you don't have those big aspirations, in a business sense, other than to play.\" \n\nDrummer Chris Adler, long regarded as one of the most jaw-droppingly talented and proficient rhythm keepers in metal concurs, \"Wrath was a bit of a first round knock-out punch to the face album and was purposefully very aggressive. Resolution is much more of a dynamic album.\u201d He also feels that Resolution is born of the desire to surprise himself along with the fans who are happily along for the ride. He says, \u201cA lot of bands get to the point where they put out seven or eight records and fans start to take them for granted. They aren\u2019t the 'cool guys' anymore. I\u2019m not immune to that, and we wanted to push ourselves and surprise ourselves by not resting on prior successes and by default surprising our fans.\u201d Even so, he's not interested in following any sort of trends. He continued, \u201cThe biggest thing is that we don\u2019t all want to be the next 'fill in the blank.' We don\u2019t have a unified influence as a band. Because of that, our approach and our sound is slightly different than most bands. We fight and argue which makes it a more honest process.\u201d As bandmate Blythe said earlier, Lamb of God, as an entity is like a living, breathing creature, not one that is plugged in. \n\nThe desire to maintain a \"personal best\" also keeps Adler and his bandmates at the very top of their game this deep into an enviable career. \u201cWhat inspires me is to outdo the 21-year-old that I was,\" he states. \"I have to prove to myself that I am still a player in this game and keep up with the best. As a band it was important to us to prove to ourselves that we have something left to offer. We don\u2019t need to put out records anymore, but we want to put out records. We don\u2019t want to tarnish the legacy of the band, so whatever we do has to be stronger than what we\u2019ve done. And we\u2019ve done it with Resolution.\u201d\n\nAs Blythe decreed, the fact that the band owns the same goals since their humble beginning is what makes the album so real. Bassist John Campbell says, \u201cPutting out heavy music has been our aim since we started this. We wanted to be a great, heavy band. It was never a thought to us that this would be conceptual commercially. We\u2019re all the original members and this is what we do. This isn\u2019t a contrived business thing to get famous and make money. Our core value is to write heavy music, and I think that\u2019s what makes a great band.\u201d \n\nAmen to that!\n\nSo with that mindset firmly and collectively in place, when it came time to write and record Resolution, and to get into the meats and the guts of the album, the band elected to let producer Josh Wilbur become involved sooner, to direct what was flowing out of them, egos be damned. \"We did incorporate Josh [Wilbur] a bit earlier in the process this time around,\" guitarist Willie Adler says. \"To have an objective ear early on in the process allowed us to sideline our egos at times and really drive for the best shit possible. We also wanted, as far as guitars are concerned, to really capture our live tone to record.\u201d\n\nMorton also revealed that the band did try something new and different with Resolution. \u201cUnlike any other album before, this album was written over the course of a couple of years, at least with the guitars. Willie and I starting songwriting as soon as we started touring with Wrath,\" instead of their usual M.O. of touring writing upon their return from the road. \"Due to having the recording software, we were able to take down ideas,\" he says about the head start. As a result, Resolution boasts some of the most punk rock moments and some of the bluesiest moments of the band's recorded career, perhaps fostered along by the liveliness of the writing-on-the-road process. \n\nThe album may display some of the band's deeper and less obvious influences, but Chris Adler is quick to assess the album's frantic energy. You can feel tension and release in the songs, making the album as a whole a truly cathartic experience. He says, \u201cWe really were living on a bit of the edge of our capabilities. There are some frantic moments in the music; they sound almost panic-inducing. The album is overwhelmingly aggressive and will definitely get people off their asses and driving fast.\u201d\n\nBlythe, he of the booming, bellowing voice, is known for spitting out provocative verses in a militaristic, almost drill-sergeant style bark. His voice and his style demand and command your attention. What he declares in the space of his lyrics isn't always comfortable \u2013for him or for you- but he will always make you think about what he is saying. \"I\u2019m 40 years old, and I\u2019m just now really getting some clarity on where my place in my life is,\" Blythe admits. \"This is about me getting clarity after partying for a long amount of time, looking at my life and saying 'This is where I am, where do I want to go now?'\" \n\nAsking that question, which is something more than a fair share of the band's red-blooded, average American fans are likely to pose to themselves, allowed the singer to enter an entirely different zone on Resolution. While he may have experienced discomfort, LOG ended up with a better and more honest record for it. He continues, \"It\u2019s an introspective record and goes over some uncomfortable things for me. I hope people that hear those lyrics will look at themselves and look at the world around them and say 'This is where I am, I don\u2019t like this.' and try to invoke a change in themselves. My overall feeling for this record is 'awakening.'\" \n\nThe singer admits that he was attracted to underground, aggressive music in his youth because it offered a voice of dissent, one that he could relate to, so he attempts to distill that same feeling into Lamb of God. \"That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to put forth in my music,\" he says. \"Not everything is really okay. You can have your cable TV and Xbox in your car or whatever, but that doesn\u2019t mean that everything is okay and you can just stop because it\u2019s easy. The root of what I try to put forth lyrically is 'Think for yourself.' Do something, do anything.\u201d And that's precisely what bonds Lamb of God to their legion of loyal fans that have stuck with them for seven albums. Well, that and those bludgeoning riffs and technically proficient grooves have something to do with it, as well! \n\nWhile Resolution admittedly contains some of \"the swampiest, sludgiest stuff\" of their career, according to Morton, as well as some of the aforementioned \"most punk\" songs they've ever laid to tape, the album also boldly goes elsewhere and features strings, orchestral movements and bluesy, acoustic guitars living among the band's patented, potent groove and swagger. The song \"Insurrection\" is a signature, natural and instinctive moment for Chris Adler, who revealed the song was born when the group was locked together in a room and tasked with seeing what it could come up with. \n\nAlbum closer \"King Me\" is a real showpiece on an album full of showpieces. As Resolution's punctuation mark, it's a beautiful piece of music from grizzled, meat-and-potatoes-peddling veterans. It was purposely placed at the end of the album, as an unexpected pay off for the fan who spent an hour of his or her life listening to what came before it. Even though Lamb of God make music that could put hair on your chest, underneath the buzz of the guitars, the thunder of the percussion and the ferocity of the vocal declarations, this is still thinking man's metal.\n\n\"\"King Me' is an epic song,\" Blythe declares without hesitation. \"It fits that definition, there\u2019s no way around it. When a song is an epic song, you want to make it as big as possible, which is what we did with the opera singer and the string incorporation.\" Morton shared a little more about the process and how they arrived at such an \"epic\" moment, saying, \"This isn\u2019t necessarily us changing our songwriting approach or the method, but we really stretched out in the way we 'treated' the songs. Those are things that are added to the song after the fact, but they have a very impact on the overall sound. I don\u2019t think we looked at it as 're-inventing' ourselves; it\u2019s really as simple as that we\u2019re continuing to strive to make music that we\u2019re interested in and that we\u2019re challenged to play, and that we enjoy performing.\u201d\n\nNow that Resolution is in the books and has asserted its rightful place as one of the most cohesive, dynamic and boot-to-the-throat heavy albums in Lamb of God's already extensive body of work, complete with epic and provocative moments, the goal remains singular: to move fans and connect with them, all the while creatively stimulating themselves. Lamb of God are pleased with the album. The only question mark is the fans and judging from the heft and the intensity of Resolution, there will be nothing but pleased fans once they get a load of the album.\n\nWillie Adler said, \"To see someone who has really been touched by the music is inspiring to me. Regardless of what emotion they\u2019re feeling, what they\u2019re going thru in their life at that moment, as long as they feel something, I feel as though I\u2019ve done my job.\u201d It's true that Resolution has the capacity to connect with its listener on multiple emotional levels, in addition to the sonic one.\n\nPerhaps Morton sums up Resolution the best: \"If it doesn't make you want to push the accelerator to the floor a little harder, flip off a cop or throw a bottle against a brick wall, then I haven't have done my job.\"\n \nFew bands can craft an album that's as thoughtful as it is visceral. One is often sacrificed in favor of the other. But such is not the case here. Lamb of God have managed to create a masterwork that allows the listener to unlock layers of sound and meaning on each consecutive listen.  \n\nThere's a whole host of reasons that Lamb of God remain at the top of their game in 2012, while others have faded and fallen away. Resolution is evidence of the band's stronghold on heavy metal in 2012. None can match it, nor do they come close.  \n\nIn 2012, and with Resolution, Lamb of God has earned their place in the metal pantheon.

{"about":"Twitter:  http:\/\/twitter.com\/kaskade  Soundcloud: https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/kaskade","bio":"\u201cKaskade\u2019s signature sound is as unmistakable as it is beautiful; a combination of dewy female vocals, tough electronic underpinnings, and memorable melodies.\u201d -- Billboard\n\nThe New York Times may have called him the \u201cnew face of electronic dance music\u201d in a recent profile, but Ryan Raddon, known as Kaskade, has been in the trenches of the EDM scene as an original recording artist and in-demand DJ for more than a decade.  He has released seven studio albums, including his latest, Fire & Ice, scored nine Top 10 hits on Billboard\u2019s Hot Dance Airplay Chart, created chart-topping remixes for everyone from Lady Gaga to Beyonc\u00e9, appeared at all the major summer festivals, and has performed between 150 and 200 headlining shows a year for the last 10 years, building a name for himself as an innovator of the EDM scene as we know it today, which has opened doors for the likes of Deadmau5, Tiesto, Skrillex and more.  In doing so, he has helped to lay the groundwork for a titanic musical and cultural shift: a post-rock EDM revolution that has captured the imagination of a new generation of music lovers across North America\n\nKaskade has been named America\u2019s No. 1 DJ by DJ Times and Pioneer DJ.  In 2012, he will appear at this year\u2019s Coachella, for which he has a special performance planned, and will hit the road in May for his biggest headlining tour ever \u2014 50-plus North American shows in just over three months.  His own live show is a jaw-dropping spectacle that finds him performing in front of an 80-foot wide, three-stories tall LED screen that blares images synched with the music while strobe lights scan the crowd.  Kaskade\u2019s belief in the transformative power of dance music to uplift thousands of people at once has had a significant effect on the U.S. scene. His ground-breaking double residency in Las Vegas at the Encore Beach Club (which had not even been built when he signed on) and Marquee has elevated the city\u2019s status as a premiere club-going destination on par with London, Berlin, and Ibiza, is another testament to his influence.\n\nGrowing up in the Chicago suburbs, Raddon was heavily influenced by New Wave bands like The Cure, Echo and The Bunnymen, and The Smiths that ignited his love for melody and lyrics and was strongly impacted by the house music scene that developed in Chicago.   Following stints spinning throughout college and in A&R at OM Records, he began working on his own music, which includes multiple singles, EPs, and remixes, as well as the albums:  his most recent 2011 release Fire & Ice \u2013 which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Dance Chart, No. 3 on the Independent Albums chart, and No. 17 on the Top 200 Albums chart, while the iTunes version debuted at No. 4 on the overall album chart.  The Fire disc contains ten original songs geared firmly toward the dancefloor, while on the Ice disc, Kaskade delivers the perfect down-tempo post-club experience by remixing all ten songs.  Both discs showcase the musical versatility tat has characterized his work ever since he began writing his own songs.  This album was preceded by It\u2019s You, It\u2019s Me (2003), In the Moment (2004), The Calm (2006), Here & Now (2006), Love Mysterious (2006), Strobelite Seduction (2008), Dynasty (2010) and Dance.Love (2010). \n\n\n--\nROCKSTAR is the world's most powerful energy drink.

{"about":"New Album 'New Life' - Available Now! http:\/\/smarturl.it\/newlife","band_interests":"Call Monica!: 404-418-6147","bio":"Cherish it - because again, not only is it from Monica, the Grammy Award winning singer and actress who's sold more than 10 million copies of her previous three albums, but it is what she declares \"a real representation of who I am and what my life is like now. It reflects the last 11 years inside and outside of the industry. It allows people to know me. Finally.\"\n\nLet\u2019s start with her foundation.\nRemember, she is from the A - Born, raised and never lived anywhere else but Atlanta.\nSo the Jermaine Dupri-produced first single \"Everytime Tha Beat Drop\" should really come as no surprise.\" 'Beat Drop', for me, is a real good representation of where I'm from,\" Monica says of the call to the dancefloor she crafted with Atlanta's snap music pioneers, Dem Franchize Boyz. \"Plus I really liked having a record that kids can enjoy. My music has always had a message. I guess it's been just a personality thing - I've always been extremely mature for my age. Always been kind of deep. But sometimes that goes right over the kids' heads. And we all just want to dance and have fun. This is what I live. What I dance to. What I listen to when I'm in my car. So I thought, 'Why wouldn't I sing over it?' \"\n\nOn this foundation, Monica has built quite the reputation for brutal honesty \u2014 from \u201cDon\u2019t Take It Personal (Just One of Dem Days)\u201d to \u201cFirst Night\u201d to \u201cKnock Knock\u201d and \u201cU Should\u2019ve Known Better.\u201d\u201cMy audience respects my honesty,\u201d she reminds us. \u201cThey trust that what comes out of my mouth truly comes from my heart.\u201d\nAnd falling right in the disc changer with those singles is \"Sideline Ho.\"\nIn the Underdogs-produced dagger, she asks: \"Ain't you tired of spending all the holidays alone?\"And then comes back and digs deeper with: \"It don't matter if he spends the night, his home's somewhere else...If you don't make his breakfast, you's a 'Sideline Ho!'\n\"Myself, Damon [Thomas], Harvey [Mason Jr.] and Tank came up with that. I was telling Tank about a situation where an ex of mine blatantly, openly cheated - as if people didn't know who his girlfriend was! And just the sound of her name would make my flesh crawl. So he was like, 'Well what did you call her?' I said, 'She has no name. She has no importance.' And Tank walked back into the room and said, 'The name of this song is 'Sideline Ho.'\n\n\"Why Her,\" also produced by Monica's longtime musical associate Jermaine Dupri, is what she calls her post-'Sideline Ho' song. \"After the anger of being cheated on, instead of healing and moving forward, we get mired in all of these questions. At that point in my situation I was like, 'What was it? I don't see anything visually any better. I don't know anything any better about her. She's struggling to work on video sets. And I'm in disarray.\n\"I don't care what people say, people always look at themselves, ask themselves those kinds of questions once somebody cheats. That's just how love works. It doesn't cut off at the sight of a mistake. We're all like, 'Does he live with her now? Do you think they're going to have kids?' Just vulnerable.\"Now that's an adjective rarely used to describe Monica in her decade-plus in the business. Not the 24-year-old who was introduced to the world in 1995 on an album titled \"Miss Thang.\"\n\"People assume nothing affects me,\" she concedes. \"And I am extremely strong-natured. I stand with both feet planted firmly and don't bend. But I know now sometimes I need to bend. 'Hell No' (produced by the Grammy-nominated Bryan-Michael Cox) shows that side of me that's a lot more sensitive. And vulnerable.\"\nAnd may we add, adaptable. Not only does the rapper so fast he's in the Guinness Book of World Records appear on \"Hell No.\" But Monica matches Twista - zip for zip.\n\"I never thought I would be able to pick up his flow in any shape, form or fashion,\" she recalls. \"But he said the same thing Missy's always saying to me - 'You're a slick talker. You never run out of words.' So he wrote my verse and he rapped it in spaces, in little bite-sized chunks. And I would rap it back, until I learned it. It took about two hours but I'm so glad I did it. It was a good experience, an example of why my mom always taught us not to use the word 'can't.' At 24 I am still learning lessons.\"\n\nBut look at how she\u2019s already applied those lessons, and what she\u2019s become thus far: Her loveliness can be heard in one of her fourth CD's vocal standouts: \"Get Away.\"\nThe spare, dramatic force begins: \"I started out as a little girl. Singing songs changed my world.\" And before you know, Monica's sharing her life with you - inside and out:\n\"I give so much of me\/When is time for me to receive? \"It's not as easy as it seems\/And to think, this was my dream.\" \"Jermaine always knows exactly how I feel about things,\" Monica says. \"And I felt this way most when my first love died. Him committing suicide changed my life in a lot of ways. It brought me closer to what I was raised with, which is a Christian family. It brought me closer to God, which is where I need to be. And it made me wish for the first time in my entire life that I was a normal person, with a normal job, who could take time off to grieve. I had to learn to live with my situation in front of the public's eye. But in the recording of this song, I was to myself. In the 11 years I've been in this industry I didn't think such a place existed. And physically I don't think it does. But mentally it's there, in this song.\" Loving pulses through \"Doin' Me Right,\" her Missy Elliott-produced tribute to a guy who makes seven figures, talks slicker and is an, a-hem, tongue-flicker.\n\n\"That kind of song is a bit different for me,\" Monica says playfully. \"But if you haven't heard, I have a son. And he didn't get here like Jesus. Some things have taken place. And I think the song is a nice way of saying how I certainly feel.\" \"Dozen Roses,\" however, is exactly how she feels. She's in love. \"I be losing my mind every time I look at you,\" she says in another Missy production, made even dreamier by a sample of Curtis Mayfield\u2019s \u201cThe Makings of You.\u201d \"You've got style just like a Bentley coupe.... You're just like my rims, you shine.\" \"Like I said, 'Dozen Roses' personifies where I am right now,\" Monica says. \"Who I am right now.\"\n\nAnd to think, much of The Makings of Monica happened right before our eyes: The three million-selling debut and the hit singles - \"Don't Take It Personal (Just One of Dem Days)\" and \"Before You Walk Out of My Life\" - that made her the youngest female artist ever to have two back-to-back No. 1 hits on Billboard's R&B singles chart. (Both of which also topped its Hot 100 pop charts and earned a million in sales.) The million-selling contribution to the 1997 \"Space Jam\" soundtrack \"For You I Will.\" Then came her 1998 CD \"The Boy Is Mine,\" which not only had three consecutive No. 1 Billboard pop singles (the title track, \"Angel of Mine\" and \"First Night\"), but the title track with Brandy spent 13 weeks at No. 1 on the pop charts, and 8 at No. 1 on the R&B listing. Not to mention the duet earned Monica a Grammy to add to her American Music, Soul Train and Billboard Awards. Then there was her last million-selling CD \"After the Storm.\" All of which she managed while acting in the MTV movie \"Love Song,\" the Miramax movie \"Boys and Girls\" and most recently, Warner Bros\/Overbrook\u2019s \"ATL.\"\n\nThe Makings of Me is the least Monica could give you for so much support over so many projects.\nThen again, The Makings of Me is ALL Monica is.","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Atlanta, Georgia","general_manager":"MonDeenise Productions Management Office: 770-964-1318","genre":"R&B","hometown":"Atlanta, Georgia","is_published":true,"record_label":"RCA","talking_about_count":24862,"username":"monica","website":"http:\/\/www.monica.com http:\/\/bit.ly\/dqOk0x","were_here_count":0,"id":"18465939920","name":"Monica","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/monica","likes":5560134,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150721610134921","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/522772_10150721610134921_1407227540_n.jpg","offset_y":12,"offset_x":0}}

{"band_members":"Q-Tip\nPhife Dawg\nAli Shaheed Muhammad\nJarobi","bio":"A Tribe Called Quest is one of Hip Hops most legendary, beloved and revered groups of all time and for good reason. Easily recognized for their unique approach to rap music by employing jazz infused soundscapes to Afro centric rhymes, sans the jaded and often nihilistic aggressive posturing associated with hip-hop, A Tribe Called Quest was largely responsible for the popularity of a new genre that dominated the East Coast sound of the early 1990s.\n\n\nQueens, New York natives Q-Tip , Phife Dawg , and Ali Shaheed Muhammad of Brooklyn, formed ATCQ in 1985. Jarobi, the honorary member of ATCQ, though not always heard, was a fixture of the group in heart and in friendship. QUEST, the original name of the group, was later given the prefix A Tribe Called by their high school buddies, The Jungle Brothers, while recording Black Is Black for their album Straight Out The Jungle. ATCQ, along with the Jungle Brothers and De La Soul, formed a unit called The Native Tongues. With a building buzz around The Native Tongues and Tribes energetic live performances, ATCQ landed a major recording contract with Jive Records in 1989.\n\n\nSonically, ATCQ was a decisive and welcomed tangent of jazz, bass-heavy rhythmic vibes and eclectic sampling when compared to the mundane recycling of soul loops, breaks and vocals of their contemporaries. Lyrically, emcees Q-Tip and Phife Dawg addressed social issues relevant to young blacks such as use of the n word and its relevance, date rape and other interpersonal relationships, industry politics and consumerism with infectious energy and fun and having a good time while still promoting positivity.\n\n\nATCQ composed a number of successful singles and albums with their creative approach to rap music. In 1990, the group released Peoples Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm, scoring several memorable songs including Bonita Applebum, Can I Kick It and I Left my Wallet in El Segundo. It was their sophomore effort, The Low End Theory, considered one of the greatest follow-ups in hip-hop history, that would solidify them as legends. Released in late 1991, the freedom expressed in the creation and feel of this record - along with its successor Midnight Marauders - influenced many future artists and producers such as Common, The Roots, Jill Scott, Kanye West and The Neptunes. These artists are a part of ATCQs legacy and are evidence of ATCQs impact for years to come. Classics like Award Tour, Electric Relaxation, Check The Rhyme and Scenario defined ATCQs sound during this period.\n\n\nIn 1996, ATCQs fourth album, Beats, Rhymes & Life, was released. The Ummah - a production team consisting of Q-Tip , Ali Shaheed and newcomer and stellar talent Jay Dee (now Jay Dilla of Slum Village) - was established the same year. The team worked together to share their aural aesthetic with other artists like Janet Jackson, DAngelo, and Faith Evans.\n\n\nATCQ continued to perfect and advance their sound, displaying their unique take on hip-hop. It was with the completion of their fifth studio album, The Love Movement, that ATCQ chose to exit the proverbial stage.\n\n\nIn recent years, the anticipation for another ATCQ album has been building. The Abstract Poetic, Five Foot Assasin , and Mr. Muhammad have yet to grace the studio for another record, but have hit the road again. Today, the power of their music is still evident in their dynamic stage shows and in the reception of their adoring fans.\n\n\nA Tribe Called Quests anomalous posture has changed the face and sound of hip-hop and paved the way for future groups, artists, producers and even fans to be unapologetic about their creative expression.

{"about":"Oficial Facebook de Alex Ubago\nwww.alexubago.com\nwww.alexubago.net","artists_we_like":"Alejandro Sanz","band_interests":"Skiing, Traveling, Family","band_members":"Alex Ubago\n\n\nEquipo Alex: Rosalyn, Adriana y Mary\n\nBlogger: Adriana A.\n\n\n\n\u00a9All Rights Reserved","bio":"Alex Ubago was born in Vitoria, Spain on January 29th, 1981. He was baptized on February 17th and was named Alejandro, but soon became Alex. Alex is an only child, and when he was four years old his parents moved to San Sebastian due to job issues. He's lived there since then. Alex is very extroverted and also has a shy side and does not have problems relating to others. He says he loves to enjoy life at all moments and has never stopped going out on a weekend because of an exam. \n\n\"Without thinking, just because, I would write a song. That's how I started at 15. Then one day I finished a song that I liked and wanted someone to listened to it, I wanted to sing it to someone. That first song still exists, it's written but not recorded. From that moment on I kept writing. A few songs later I wrote \"Sabes\" and \"Hay que ver\", which are recorded on the first cd. I got use to it, I would be in bed and a melody or a lyric would appear. I would write a paragraph, don't know how to continue, leave it there, and continue days or weeks later\". \n\nOne day Alex called his cousin David. He's a musician and has a home studio. Alex got excited, during two or three weeks he used to go there at nights and record. His first demo\/cd had five songs. He finished recording all five songs, two or three were written for his girlfriend at that time. Her birthday was coming and he gave her the cd. Alex thought it was something pretty and original. Those were the first songs heard by his manager, \u00cd\u00f1igo Argom\u00e1niz. Alex's cousin Ram\u00f3n gave him the model. He runs the Antonio Bar, at which \u00cd\u00f1igo used to go to. \n\nLater, of course, came more songs and more demos. Alex told him about his life and that had no more songs recorded. \"\u00cd\u00f1igo told me he liked it, he told me to keep writing tranquilly, with calm. He never promised anything; he never said I would record an album. He just said we would sit again when I had 12 or 14 more songs. I went back home very excited. And I started writing without a deadline. When I had more songs, I sent them to him. He asked for more and I wrote more. 25 songs in a year\". \n\nAlex says his songs tell simple stories, personal stories, that could happen to anybody. \"I don't set any relation of power or predominance of a person over another one. Nobody's a winner or a looser. All of us learn and all of us teach. Sometimes I need and to other's I am needed. I want to keep a balance between both parts of a relationship and I defend individual liberty, the need of each one to look and follow his way. Be oneself!\" \n\nAlex used to send new songs to \u00cd\u00f1igo and he'd send them to Alfonso P\u00e9rez, artistic director of Dro. When Alex acheived a large quanity of songs, he went to Madrid to meet the people from the record label. \"On October 2000 I came back to sign a contract with Dro. On January 2001 I was already working with Jes\u00fas G\u00f3mez, my producer. When I started recording the album, I had no band. Later I met the musicians that now play with me, when I needed to rehearsal in case of a concert. I love all five of them. I don't think of me as a singer with a band. Marco, Xavi, Sergio, Carlos, Paul and I have made a friends group cause it's been two years of traveling no stops, all day together. We're the same since the beginning and they always contribute with new stuff\". \n\nAlex says his life has changed, but more around him than in himselfe. \"I've learned a lot, but my personality hasn't changed. The work, the experiences, the trips all helps me to grown-up. My sense of responsibility has grown cause I work with a lot of people, but I'm not pressure because of that. I don't have the feeling that everyone depends on me. At least, I don't think so. I've also lost a bit of my personal liberty, although I don't feel persecuted or hounded. I also don't intend to be an influence to others through my songs, even if it's like that, because I don't want to influence anybody. I like that people feels all right listening to me, that my songs can be useful when they interpret them their own way, but that's it. I intend to have an under control musical career. There are some people whom just want to be famous. I want to live from music and that's enough for me. I would've settle with a lot less\". \n\nAviones de Cristal \nThree years without recording an album seems like a lot of time for someone as young as \u00c1lex, who has known the success (more than 20 disks of gold and platinum in Spain, Latin America and USA and innumerable prizes on the part of the criticism and public). \n\n\"Aviones de Cristal\" is the disk of the maturity, 12 new songs of love, disaffection or routine things. \n\nAlex has counted with the contribution of some excellent musicians as Enzo Filippone, John Parsons, Marcelo Fuentes and Alfonso P\u00e9rez. All the previous disks under the production of Jesus N. G\u00f3mez. \n","booking_agent":"Get In Producciones","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"San Sebastian, ES","description":"El mejor para informacion de Alex Ubago!","general_manager":"Get In Producciones","genre":"Latin\/Spanish Pop","hometown":"San Sebastian, ES","influences":"Alejandro Sanz, Beatles","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Warner Music Latina","record_label":"Warner Music Spain","release_date":"23 de Septiembre de 2001","talking_about_count":52561,"username":"AlexUbagoMusic","website":"http:\/\/www.alexubago.com\/ http:\/\/www.alexubago.net http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/alexubagoficial\/ http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/equipoalex","were_here_count":0,"id":"19296830844","name":"Alex Ubago Music","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AlexUbagoMusic","likes":2740281,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151669145895845","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/1011183_10151669145895845_1949869710_n.jpg","offset_y":10,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Fading West Available for Pre-Order Now!","band_members":"Jon Foreman\nTim Foreman\nChad Butler\nJerome Fontamillas\nDrew Shirley","bio":"As they enter their 17th year as a band, Switchfoot has achieved a level of success that brothers Jon and Tim Foreman and their high-school friend Chad Butler never anticipated when forming the band in San Diego in 1996. The SoCal natives have sold 5.5 million copies worldwide of their eight studio albums (including their 2003 double-platinum breakthrough The Beautiful Letdown and 2009\u2019s Grammy Award-winning Hello Hurricane), racked up a string of Alternative radio hit singles (\u201cMeant to Live,\u201d \u201cDare You To Move,\u201d \u201cMess of Me,\u201d \u201cThe Sound (John M. Perkins\u2019 Blues),\u201d \u201cDark Horses,\u201d and \u201cAfterlife\u201d), performed sold-out world tours (visiting five continents in the past year alone), raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to aid homeless kids in their community through their own Bro-Am Foundation, and earned themselves a global fan base devoted to Switchfoot\u2019s emotionally intelligent and uplifting brand of alternative rock.\n\nSo when it came time to write the songs that would make up their ninth studio album, the members of Switchfoot were looking for a challenge. \u201cThe point became, \u2018What are we going to do to push ourselves,\u2019\u201d Jon recalls. \u201cCould we take ourselves somewhere we\u2019d never been before, yet achieve a feeling of comfort at the same time? How do we go to a new place that feels like home?\u201d \n\nSwitchfoot found the answers on the road and in the waves. A year ago, while touring in support of their 2011 album Vice Verses, the long-time surfers set out in search of inspiration by visiting several of their favorite surf breaks around the world. \u201cThe idea was to surf, write songs, play music, and see what ideas came,\u201d says Tim. The band traveled to Jeffreys Bay and Crayfish Factory in South Africa, Bronte Beach in Australia, Raglan in New Zealand, and Uluwatu in Bali, and chronicled their physical and emotional journey, as well as their unshakeable brotherly bond, in Fading West \u2014 a documentary film that features stunning locales, revealing interviews, jubilant live footage, and glimpses of Switchfoot at home and in their studio in San Diego. Like Rattle and Hum meets Endless Summer, the movie is part travelogue, part surf film, and part behind-the-scenes look at the making of the band\u2019s upcoming new album, which will also be entitled Fading West. \n\nNot surprisingly, the album, which finds Switchfoot returning to the melodic pop sensibility of their early years, was inspired by the sea, which Jon describes as a perfect metaphor for simultaneously experiencing comfort and danger. \u201cYou\u2019re comfortable out there, but it\u2019s the unknown,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can paddle out in South Africa and it\u2019s exactly like home and nothing like home all at once. That\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping our record feels like \u2014 trying to find peace in dangerous places.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s a memorable scene in Fading West where the band members are paddling out at Uluwatu with their friend, surf champ Rob Machado. Jon says he had a major epiphany that day. \u201cAs I sat on my board in the Indian Ocean, I realized that these waves could eventually make it back to my home of San Diego thousands of miles away,\u201d he says. \u201cThat rhythm and pulse was really grounding and inspiring on so many levels. It made me grasp the dichotomy between the pull of the road and the pull toward getting back home. It\u2019s like we had to leave home to find home. For a long time, home was a place of failure because it meant that we didn\u2019t have any shows,\u201d Jon adds. \u201cWhen you drop out of college in your early \u201920s and all your friends are getting jobs and you\u2019re the guy who lives with his parents, it\u2019s way better to be on the road. Only recently did I feel like home was a place where I could feel comfortable and content.\u201d\n\nSwitchfoot traces its roots to the beaches of San Diego when the Foremans and Butler connected as surfers (Jerome Fontamillas joined in September 2000 and Drew Shirley in 2005). Though they competed in national surf championships on weekends, their real bond came from a common love of music. They decided to form a band, chose the name Switchfoot (a surfing term), put themselves through months of sweaty rehearsals in their garage, and then hit the road. After just 20 gigs, Switchfoot signed with re:Think Records and released three albums, The Legend of Chin (1997), New Way To Be Human (1999), and the gold-certified Learning to Breathe (2000), before signing with Columbia Records, which released their fourth album, The Beautiful Letdown, on its Red\/Ink subsidiary, upping the band to Columbia proper after the album sold more than a million copies. (It eventually sold 2.6 million.) The band released two more albums with Sony, 2005\u2019s Nothing Is Sound, which debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard album chart, and 2006\u2019s Oh! Gravity., which climbed to No. 1 on the iTunes Album chart, before going their separate ways with the company.  \n\nItching for creative freedom, Switchfoot financed the building of its own studio where they recorded their seventh album, the hard-hitting Hello Hurricane, and its groove-oriented follow-up Vice Verses, both of which they released on their own lowercase people records via Atlantic Records. (Jon also released four solo EPs and a debut album with Fiction Family, his side project with Nickel Creek\u2019s Sean Watkins.) \n\nAlong the way, Switchfoot have been steadfast in their commitment to giving back by supporting various humanitarian causes, such as DATA, the ONE Campaign, Habitat for Humanity, Invisible Children, and To Write Love on Her Arms. In 2005, the band held its first annual Bro-Am, a day-long event that includes a surf contest, live concert on the beach, charity auction, and after-party at local tavern Belly Up. Now in its ninth year, the Bro-Am has raised more than $715,000 to benefit local children's charities that aid at-risk, homeless, and street kids in San Diego. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a really young fan base and some of the kids who come to our shows are homeless,\u201d Tim says. \u201cYou\u2019d never know it, but they are. I think we\u2019ve always been drawn to the underdog, and I can\u2019t think of a bigger underdog than a kid who\u2019s fighting for his life at the age of 12.\u201d\n\nSwitchfoot premiered Fading West on opening night of the 2013 Summer X-Games in August.  (The band have been very active in the action sports world, having performed at numerous NFL and MLB post-game events, as well as at the US Open of Surfing in 2011.)  They will spend the fall on a unique tour, with the film serving as the opening act to a more intimate, stripped down performance from the band.  The film will be released digitally towards the end of 2013, with the new album seeing it\u2019s release on January 14, 2014.  \n\nWe weren\u2019t chasing anything in particular when we started the band,\u201d Jon says in the film. \u201cWe simply had these songs that we loved playing. It\u2019s that joy that fueled us and it\u2019s that joy that has kept us going and brought us to here.\u201d ","category":"Musician\/band","description":"Fading West the album and film are available for pre-order on iTunes now! http:\/\/atlr.ec\/1bAVePB","genre":"Rock","hometown":"San Diego, CA","is_published":true,"record_label":"Atlantic Records\/Lowercase People Records","talking_about_count":6607,"username":"switchfoot","website":"http:\/\/switchfoot.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"6224991678","name":"Switchfoot","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/switchfoot","likes":2124170,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152346670896679","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1470352_10152346670896679_1105094202_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

The band has since released 14 studio albums.  Megadeth consists of Dave Mustaine (vocals, guitars), Chris Broderick (guitars, background vocals), David Ellefson (bass, background vocals) and Shawn Drover (drums, percussion, background vocals).\n\nMustaine's musical roots began early on listening to AC\/DC and Led Zeppelin, and took form in the New Wave of British Heavy Metal when he co-founded Metallica. Megadeth emerged in 1985 at the forefront of the thrash\/speed metal scene with their seminal debut \"Killing Is My Business\u2026 And Business Is Good\", and continued on a blistering path of albums and tours throughout the decade. The nickname \"world's state-of-the-art speed metal band\" and the critic-coined \"intellectual thrash metal\" were often used to describe Megadeth's sound, referring to Mustaine's niche for angry, witty, intelligent lyrics about topics like politics, drugs and war, fused with aggressive, intricate guitar structures and a jazz-influenced rhythm section.\n\nWith a string of five consecutive platinum and multi-platinum albums Megadeth became one of the biggest bands of the mid-\u201880s and \u201890s, boasting such arena anthems as \u201cPeace Sells\u2026 But Who\u2019s Buying\" (The opening bassline was used as the theme for MTV News for years afterward), \"Holy Wars\u2026 The Punishment Due\", \"Symphony Of Destruction\" and \"Sweating Bullets\", along with the top singles in 1997\/98 off \"Cryptic Writings\", \"Trust\"  (No. 1 radio track), \"Almost Honest\", \"Use The Man\" and \"A Secret Place\". In all, the band has scored five Top 10 albums and two Top 5 releases.\n\nThe 90's saw a change in Megadeth's sound with the polished and commercial multi-platinum release \"Countdown To Extinction\", which skyrocketed them into multi-platinum success and MTV stardom. The incorporation of this new sound would be a trademark of every release to come, and would eventually earn them 11 Grammy nominations for Best Metal Performance, 7 platinum certifications, and selling more than 38 million albums worldwide. \n\nAfter a brief hiatus early in the 2000's, Mustaine triumphantly returned with a comeback album, a heavy metal festival called Gigantour and a new display of prodigious musicians to back him. The band's legacy continued with 2009's critically acclaimed \"Endgame\", which debuted at #9 on the Billboard charts and 2010's multi-platinum \"The Big Four: Live From Sofia\", Bulgaria featuring the \"Big Four\" of 1980's thrash metal \u2014 Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax.\n\nMegadeth's 13th studio album, \"TH1RT3EN\" was released in November, 2011 debuting at #1 on The Billboard Hard Rock Albums chart and #11 on the Billboard 200. The band\u2019s 14th studio album, \"Super Collider\" was released in June, 2013 debuting at #6 on The Billboard 200, Megadeth\u2019s highest chart debut since 1994\u2019s \"Youthanasia\". \"Super Collider\" is the first release on Mustaine\u2019s new label, Tradecraft, through Universal Music Enterprises.","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Los Angeles","genre":"Thrash Metal","hometown":"Los Angeles, CA","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":98898,"username":"Megadeth","website":"www.megadeth.com, http:\/\/cyberarmy.megadeth.com, www.twitter.com\/megadeth, www.myspace.com\/megadeth, www.twitter.com\/davemustaine, www.facebook.com\/davemustaine, http:\/\/www.smarturl.it\/megadethstore, www.instagram.com\/davemustaine, www.instagram.com\/megadeth","were_here_count":0,"id":"7709052329","name":"Megadeth","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Megadeth","likes":7119930,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151496877442330","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/993980_10151496877442330_749788212_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":100}}

Inspired by the monumental 2008 Presidential election, Legend teamed up with The Roots to release the socially conscious album, Wake Up! (2010.)  The album was nominated for five Grammy Awards and won Best R&B Album, Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B song (for \u201cShine\u201d- an original composition also featured in Academy Award-winning director Davis Guggenheim\u2019s documentary film Waiting for Superman) along with two NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Album and Outstanding Duo, Group or Collaboration.  In 2007, Legend launched the Show Me Campaign, a nonprofit organization fighting poverty around the world.  John also sits on the Boards of The Education Equality Project, Teach for America, and the Harlem Village Academies. Legend has been honored several times for his activism, including the 2010 BET Humanitarian of the Year award, the 2009 CARE Humanitarian Award for Global Change, and the 2009 Africare\u2019s Bishop John T. Walker Distinguished Humanitarian Service Award.  In early 2012, Legend released one of the hottest songs of his career, the RIAA gold-certified hit \u201cTonight (Best You\u2019ve Ever Had),\u201d which sat atop the Urban AC radio chart for six consecutive weeks. Legend recently released his fifth studio album Love in the Future, with executive producers Kanye West and Dave Tozer, and will embark on a North American tour this autumn.","booking_agent":"WME","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"New York","general_manager":"Atom Factory \/ Troy Carter ","genre":"R&B\/Soul","hometown":"Springfield, OH","influences":"Stevie Wonder, Ne-Yo, Al Green, Jeff Buckley","is_published":true,"record_label":"GOOD Music- Sony\/Columbia","talking_about_count":43777,"username":"johnlegend","website":"www.johnlegend.com www.showmecampaign.org www.twitter.com\/johnlegend www.twitter.com\/showmecampaign www.myspace.com\/johnlegend www.youtube.com\/johnlegend","were_here_count":0,"id":"22516413022","name":"John Legend","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/johnlegend","likes":2770501,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151887149553023","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/9888_10151887149553023_519422627_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"http:\/\/www.pantera.com           http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/pantera           http:\/\/instagram.com\/panteraofficial    ","band_members":"Philip Anselmo\nDimebag Darrell (RIP)\nRex Brown\nVinnie Paul ","bio":" PANTERA:  A VULGAR DISPLAY OF METAL\n\nby Don Kaye\n\n     \u201cThe thing about us is that we always stayed on the ground level with the fans,\u201d proclaims Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell in his proud Texas twang. \u201cWe never rode above the fans \u2013 I\u2019m a fuckin\u2019 fan myself \u2013 and we always had great interaction with them. They\u2019re us, we\u2019re them, we\u2019re all for one and stronger than all.\u201d\n\n     Of course, it took the Dallas-based Pantera time to find their groove, shape their sound, and harness the right mix of combustible personalities.  The band emerged in the early Eighties, when drummer Vinnie Paul and his guitarist brother Dimebag Darrell put Pantera together with bassist Rex Brown and vocalist T Lee.  After three self-released albums, it was clear that a remarkably different heavier sound was evolving.  Enter new frontman and New Orleans native Philip Anselmo, , on a fourth independant release.  The collaboration with the heavy trio and explosive singer was about to set the stage for a harder, more damaging, trademark Pantera.     \n\nAfter being turned down \u201ctwenty-eight times by every major label on the face of the earth,\u201d an Atco Records A&R rep named Mark Ross saw the band when Hurricane Hugo stranded him in Texas.  The long-sought record deal finally arrived, and with it, Pantera\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d 1990 debut, titled Cowboys From Hell.  Co-produced by the band and Terry Date (Max Norman turned the project down in favor of Lynch Mob), Cowboys From Hell took Pantera\u2019s evolution to the next level.  Darrell\u2019s chugging, jagged guitars, Vinnie\u2019s machine-gun, darting drums, and Philip\u2019s collection of harsh screams, clenched-fist roars, and eerie melodies, all fused together into a sound they called \u201cpower groove.\u201d\n\n     \u201cCowboys is where everybody came into their own, along with the full-blown Pantera sound,\u201d says Vinnie.  \u201cThat was actually the first song we wrote for the record.  Basically it was about us coming out of Texas and being out of place.  People don\u2019t think of Texas as being a hot spot for heavy metal, they think of New York or L.A. or something like that, so it just seemed like an obvious concept for us.\u201d\n\n     Cowboys From Hell spawned several other unquestionable classics, including the moody, morbid epic, \u201cCemetery Gates.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ve always done a bunch of musically diverse things,\u201d says Dime.  \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of King\u2019s X and bands like that.  I was just showing a broader side of the band, the more melodic stuff we can do.\u201d\n\n     Months of solid touring molded the band into an even more lethal live act than they had been before, and two years after the release of Cowboys, the band reconvened to lay down what many fans consider their masterpiece: Vulgar Display Of Power.  Working with Date again, the band carved out an even more incendiary sonic assault on an album that truly lived up to its monicker with frightening intensity.  \n\n     The disc yielded, among others, the awesomely heavy shuffle, \u201cWalk,\u201d the pummeling, warped riffage of \u201cMouth For War,\u201d and the disturbing, bitter \u201cThis Love.\u201d  Vinnie:  \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that Philip did the very best, it\u2019s that he always wrote straight from the heart.  He never candy-coated anything or had a bullshit way of saying anything in his lyrics.  \u2018This Love\u2019 was pretty much the story of a relationship that he had been in, that just didn\u2019t work out, and he was fuckin\u2019 pissed about it!\u201d\n\n     More endless roadwork followed the release of Vulgar Display, elevating the band into bigger venues and drawing larger audiences all the time.  By the time 1994 and Far Beyond Driven rolled around, Pantera was established as the metal act to beat in terms of heaviness, sheer power, and slavish allegiance to the metal lifestyle.  \n\n     \u201cWe drove ourselves, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d says Vinnie about the album, which remains the most extreme disc to ever debut at Number One on the Billboard Top 200. \u201cWe didn\u2019t debut at Number One for any other reason than all the fans we had made on tour.  We still weren\u2019t a radio band or anything like that, so it was strictly word-of-mouth and the live show that did it.\u201d\n\n     \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get airplay and nobody gave a fuck about it, but the fans damn sure did,\u201d agrees Dime.  \u201cWe wrote that record for them.\u201d\n\n     The first single from the album, \u201cI\u2019m Broken,\u201d was \u201ca soundcheck riff \u2013 one of them ones where I\u2019d walk in with a hangover from ripping it up night after night with everyone in every town,\u201d chuckles Dime.  \u201cThat\u2019s where a lot of the best riffs I ever wrote came from. I just played the first riff I thought of, Vinnie started kickin\u2019 in on it, Rex joined in, we didn\u2019t write the entire song on the spot, but we kept toying with it and finally worked on it once we got into the studio.\u201d\n\n     And then there\u2019s \u201cFive Minutes Alone,\u201d which crystallized the band\u2019s \u201ctake no shit\u201d attitude, as Vinnie explains:  \u201cThere was a guy in the front row at Pine Knob in Detroit who was heckling Phil.  Finally, several people in the crowd just jumped this guy\u2019s ass and beat the shit out of him on the spot, so he sued us.  And when his dad called our manager, his exact quote was, \u2018you just give me five minutes along with that Phil Anselmo guy and I\u2019ll show him who\u2019s big daddy around here.\u2019  Phil\u2019s response was, \u2018You just give me five minutes along with that cat\u2019s dad and I\u2019ll whoop his ass.\u2019  That\u2019s where that song came from.\u201d\n\n     As brutal as Far Beyond Driven was, it ended on an uncharacteristically quiet note with the band\u2019s cover of Black Sabbath\u2019s dreamlike \u201cPlanet Caravan.\u201d  \u201cBlack Sabbath\u2019s one of our all-time favorite groups,\u201d says Vinnie.  \u201cWe got asked to be a part of the first Sabbath tribute record, Nativity In Black, and we were thinkin\u2019 about what song to do, and we just suddenly decided that \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d was a cool song, plus nobody would even expect it. It turned out great, but due to legal circumstances, we ended up not being on Nativity In Black, so we added it to the end of Far Beyond Driven.  We thought it was the perfect way to end the record.\u201d\n\n     The Great Southern Trendkill, released in 1996, is now considered Pantera\u2019s \u201coverlooked\u201d album, coming out as rap-metal was hitting its stride and temporarily drowning out the mighty Pantera roar.  Trendkill did, in fact, find Pantera adding some different spices to their corrosive metallic stew, but the chilling \u201cDrag The Waters\u201d best represents the album.  \u201cThat song is about a lifetime of dealing with people that you can\u2019t tell what they\u2019re really comin\u2019 at you for, or what their motives really are,\u201d snarls Dime.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to drag the waters to get to the bottom and find out the truth.\u201d\n\n     It was four years before Pantera released their next full-length studio effort, but the band was far from inactive.  Touring nonstop, the boys still managed to find time to release a live album, Official Live: 101 Proof, featuring the ominous studio bonus track, \u201cWhere We Come From,\u201d and a scalding cover of Ted Nugent\u2019s \u201cCat Scratch Fever\u201d for the soundtrack of the Kiss-themed movie, Detroit Rock City.  \u201cGene Simmons actually approached us to be a part of that,\u201d remembers Vinnie.  \u201cAnd we were like, \u2018we\u2019re old Ted fans, let\u2019s see if we can do a throwdown version of it.\u2019  To this day, I probably still hear our version in titty bars more than I hear his.\u201d\n\n     Dimebag Darrell calls the band\u2019s most recent studio album, 2000\u2019s Reinventing The Steel, a \u201cbest-of in its own right,\u201d a mix of elements from the albums that had preceded it.  Even the closing epic, \u201cI\u2019ll Cast A Shadow,\u201d was a monster.  \u201cUsually when we write, the songs come together really fast,\u201d says Dime.  \u201cBut sometimes, you\u2019ll be drilling at one for hours before you realize it ain\u2019t workin\u2019.  This was one of those.  So we put it on the back burner, finished up all the other tunes, then went back to give it one more pull.  We rearranged it, throw a few new parts in, and it really brought it to life. I think it ended up being the baddest-ass song on the whole record.\u201d\n\n     \u201cGoddamn Electric,\u201d a tribute to metal itself, was another bad-ass anthem, and warranted a special guest appearance.  \u201cWe thought, \u2018this song just gives so much respect to these other bands like Black Sabbath and Slayer, we\u2019ve just gotta get Kerry King down here to put a lead on the motherfucker,\u2019\u201d relates Vinnie. \u201cWe went and met him at the Starplex in Dallas when Slayer was on Ozzfest.

{"about":"New single \"Real and True\" on iTunes NOW! hhttp:\/\/smarturl.it\/futurerealandtrue\n\"Pluto 3D\" on iTunes NOW! http:\/\/smarturl.it\/futurepluto3d ","bio":"The man born Navyvadius Cash is ready to dominate the charts as the 25 year-old Atlanta native's classic mixtapes have put the streets and clubs in his clutches with his first single \"Tony Montana.\" \n\n\"I'm just coming out, but if you go anywhere in the south,\" says Future, \"I get that love and respect like I have a catalog of LPs under my belt. My mixtapes have had a definitive impact which is amazing and humbling at the same time. Now my music is spreading all over the world. I'm ready to deliver universal hits.\" \n\nWith his newly signed record deal courtesy of Epic Records and his connection to Atlanta's famed Dungeon Family, Future's career is finally off the launching pad. His first single's bubbling success comes from a mixture of the hypnotic track, Future's signature melodic flow, unforgettable chorus, and features international superstar Drake. \n\n\"When I was making 'Tony Montana,' it was so far fetched for me to get Drake on the record. They called me and said 'Drake wants to get on Tony.' We had a long conversation. I sent it to him and he sent it back the same night. 'Tony Montana' is the 'Scarface' movie on wax,\" explains Future. \n\nFuture's career started to take shape seven years ago when he hooked up with his cousin Rico Wade, trailblazing producer and founder of the pioneering collective of hip-hop legends, The Dungeon Family. \"I learned so much from him,\" Future says of Wade, producer of such seminal acts as OutKast, TLC, and Goodie Mob. \"He's so much of a leader. I picked up from his leadership. In order to be a leader, you have to start your own movement.\" \n\nFor months, Rico would help to cultivate Future's skills and within a year's time, Wade's Organized Noize production camp had a recording contract for the young gun through Dream Works Records, which was sold and eventually folded. The setback didn't discourage the upstart rapper. \n\nMeanwhile, Future started earning a living in the music business by staying behind the scenes writing hooks, verses, and even entire songs for artists ranging from unknowns to Grammy Award winners. \"Ludacris was one of the first artists to actually pay attention to one of my hooks. He heard a hook and I gave it to him. He used if for 'Blueberry Yum Yum' off of his Red Light District. Then I started helping Rico on various projects. I was getting money like that. I definitely have to say the Dungeon is where I studied songwriting,\" Future described. I was around writers like Sleepy Brown and Marquez Etheridge who wrote 'Waterfalls' for TLC and 'Blackberry Molasses' for Mista. My cousin had talented artists from all over the world in the Dungeon.\" \n\nFuture's fame as a songwriter finally broke through to the mainstream when he penned most of YC's Braggadocios BET Hip-Hop Award nominated blockbuster \"Racks featuring Future.\" The chorus, \"I got racks on racks on racks...\" became an instant smash in the clubs, on the radio, and was adored by everyone from fans to major artists such as Lil Wayne. \"Racks\" bubbled in the underground circuit of the south for six months before popping into mainstream this summer. In the meantime, Future started capitalizing on his buzz by putting together immaculate mixtapes such as Dirty Sprite. Songs such as \"Tony Montana\" would solidify him as the leader of the new wave of Atlanta bred superstars. \n\nAs determined as Future is now to become a music superstar, he almost got in the way of fulfilling his own dreams. \"When I was around 14 or 15, I got into the streets heavy and I got shot in my right hand. When I got shot, I stopped playing basketball and went harder hustling. My mother hated it. Whatever she wanted me to do, I did the opposite. From the time I was 17 until I was 24, I didn't talk to my mother because she didn't like what I was doing. I let the streets raise me.\" It wasn't until less than a year ago that he decided to give up hustling in the streets and solely focus on music. \"I didn't know sacrifice and patience,\" he admits. \"When I learned that, I started seeing rap pay off. I had to give the streets up to really make my way into music.\" \n\nAs much as he was allured by the streets, Future, as an adolescent was also attracted to school. \"Words always intrigued me,\" Future explained. \"When I went to school, I would read Shakespeare and just fell in love with how he mixed his words. I started playing around and writing poems, reading poems... then I started listening to Too Short... I learned all his songs.\" \n\nIn late 2010, Future went through a life change and made songs incessantly. \"I stayed in the studio everyday,\" he says. \"There are days I went to the studio broke, but I said I'm not going to miss one day in the studio. The day I miss could be the day God decided to bless me. It wasn't easy. By far the hardest thing I had to do in life was change, but it was by far the best move.\" \n\nEarlier this summer, Future inked a deal with L.A. Reid at Epic Records. The MC says it felt like destiny because Reid had also signed Organized Noize 20 years ago. Future already has his first two projects lined up: an EP this fall and a full length LP early next year. \n\n\"My EP is called Watch This and the meaning is basically, 'watch what's about to happen with my career,'\" he revealed. \"The full album is titled Pluto. Pluto is bridging the gap from where I started to now. I make 'astronaut music.' I make music on the highest level. When you listen to Pluto, you'll understand. I'm outta here! The music is more melodic on the album. It's feel good music straight from the soul. It's music with no boundaries.\" ","booking_agent":"Zach Iser - ICM Talent ziser\u0040icmtalent.com 212-556-5635","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Orlando McGhee orlando\u0040seventy2music.com","genre":"Rap","hometown":"Atlanta","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Chris Chambers - The Chamber Group chris\u0040thechambergroup.com 212-366-5801","record_label":"Freebandz\/Epic Records","talking_about_count":107072,"username":"FutureOfficial","website":"http:\/\/www.futurefreebandz.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"282106645148368","name":"Future","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FutureOfficial","likes":3565096,"cover":{"cover_id":762581617100866,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1391918_762581617100866_636853277_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":50}}

{"about":"Purchase \"READY\" f. Chris Brown On iTunes: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/FabReady ","band_members":"The S.O.U.L. Tape Coming Soon","bio":"It takes talent to make the struggle to succeed seem effortless, but that is the gift that separates artists like Brooklyn's John Jackson, aka Fabolous, from the everyday MC. While most rappers spend more and more time convincing the masses of their \"hustle,\" Fabolous lets his work speak for his effort. With two platinum albums (2001's Ghetto Fabolous and 2003's Street Dreams) and one Gold (2004's Real Talk) to his credit, the veteran hitmaker still exudes a rookie-of-the year swagger. After recording for both Elektra and Atlantic Records, Fab is enjoying a home coming with the legendary Def Jam label. His first recorded song was \"If They Want It\" from DJ Clue's The Professional, which was released by Roc-A-Fella\/Def Jam in 1998. Now he is preparing to release his fourth street classic, From Nothin' to Somethin' under the watchful eye of his longtime collaborators. \n\n\"I had people in my corner already over there,\" Fab says of DJ Clue and A&R Skane, the Desert Storm duo who discovered Fabolous. \"So it wasn't like I was coming to a new neighborhood.\" \n\nWhile he doesn't site any one reason for his move, Fabolous has learned a lot from his time in the industry and is eager to capitalize on his experience. \"I haven't peaked yet,\" he explains. \"I was happy with the past records, but I have some adversity to learn off of for the future.\" \n\nIt's appropriate that Fabolous is getting a fresh start for his latest release because he wants From Nothin' to Somethin' to be a rebirth for his fans old and new. \"Everybody is trying to take what they have and make something more,\" says Fabolous, explaining the album's title. \"It's a new year, everybody's on their hustle, back in the gym and I'm trying to give them some inspiration. This is music to chase your money too, work out--motivation music. \n\nThe first single \"Make Me Better\" is produced by Grammy Award winning producer Timbaland and finds Fabolous doing what he does best; blending radio ready sound beds with clever and memorable lyrics. Rapping that he needs \"a Corretta Scott to make me King\" Fab picks up with his female fans where \"Baby\" left off. \"It's a great feel good record, it's got a lot of style to it,\" he says. \"I wanted a record that could show that I could touch different people with my music.\" \n\nAlready recognized for his hit-making ability, Fabolous is eager to show the diversity of his technique while staying true to his blueprint for success. On the cocky \"Make Money\" he cleverly borrows Notorious B.I.G's trademark chuckle to comment on the laugh-ability of his competition: \"these dudes is stand up rappers, hip-hop comedians, I start laughin as soon as I put your CD in.\" His wit and wordplay is not something he gets enough credit for, but the MC is confident people will come around. \"Certain people recognize it,\" he says, \"but its like they'll sing it in the shower, but they won't sing it outside. It's all good though. One of them days you gonna get drunk and start singing that song.\" \n\nEnlisting a whose-who list of guests that includes Akon, Young Jeezy, Ne-Yo and Junior Reed, Fabolous plays to a variety of audiences on this disc, but there is no mistaking that it's his show from beginning to end. The anthemic \"Brooklyn\" features a yet to be disclosed surprise guest and \"Change Up\" pairs Fab with singer, producer extraodinaire Akon helping him reflect on his life and career. \n\n\"Anytime you become a successful person, people may look at you and say you changed,\" explains Fabolous, who references the October 2006 shooting that took place outside of Justin's restaurant in the lyrics of the song. \"That record just talks about people changing as a person for money, how they carry themselves and treat other people. For me, I might have changed where I live or my number, but I haven't changed as a person\u2026I slid a line or two about what happened in October but I'm not coming out with a bullet proof vest or anything.\" \n\nThe playful \"Foggin Up The Windows,\" produced by Miami's The Runners, features R. Kelly's chopped and screwed vocals from his hit \"Ignition\" to prop up Fabolous' ode to parkin' lot pimpin' of the more carnal kind.\n\n\"I just took it back to trying to get some in the car,\" he says with a laugh. \"Everyone's either done it or tried to get some in the car. It may not have been the place of choice but everybody's had a hotel on wheels.\" \n\nOther rewind worthy tracks like \"Real Playa\" featuring Lloyd, \"Diamonds\" featuring Young Jeezy and the Just Blaze produced \"Back To School\" round out an impressive collection that makes From Nothin' to Somethin' worth the two-year wait. In his absence no artist has come close to matching his boyish charm, wit and unassuming cool both on and off the mic. With a new team and a pop of his collar Fabolous is indeed \"fresh to Def.\"\n\n\"I'm trying to bring good music back to the game,\" he says confidently. \"And anybody that's bringing good music, the hype is gonna follow them.\" \n\n","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"Brooklyn, NY","influences":"GOD..MY FAMILY...ANYBODY WHO MAKES SOMETHIN' FROM NOTHIN'...","is_published":true,"record_label":"Desert Storm\/Street Family\/Def Jam","talking_about_count":58634,"username":"myfabolouslife","website":"http:\/\/www.myfabolouslife.com\/ ","were_here_count":0,"id":"114146975914","name":"Fabolous","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/myfabolouslife","likes":1780335,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151412538770915","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/554288_10151412538770915_1715672037_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"New Album Trap House III http:\/\/bit.ly\/13RkXvI","band_members":"Gucci Mane","bio":"Before achieving widespread success, most rappers are forced to endure a series of hardships. But few have gone through the same kind of trials and tribulations that Gucci Mane has.  Despite the pitfalls, Gucci Mane takes each moment in stride, both playfully and insightful. \n\nAfter building up a solid buzz in the South in the early 2000s thanks to the overwhelming success of his infectious 2003 club anthem, \u201cIcy,\u201d featuring fellow up-and-coming Southern rapper Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane caught an attempted murder charge during a much-publicized beef with Jeezy and had to serve a year in prison. Upon his return, he released his debut album, Trap House, his stellar sophomore project, Hard To Kill, and his 2007 major label debut, Back To The Trap House, before eventually being forced to serve another year-long prison sentence for a probation violation stemming from a 2005 incident.\n\nBut Gucci Mane wouldn\u2019t let a second major legal battle stop his movement. Instead, he jumped into the studio for days at a time before his sentence started and recorded dozens of songs that he eventually released through his So Icey Entertainment and 1017 Brick Squad Records imprints while he was incarcerated to help keep his name alive in the streets. It worked, and by the time Gucci Mane was released in March 2009, his buzz was better than ever and he immediately started recording songs for what would become his second major label album, The State Vs. Radric Davis.\n\nBy late 2009, the album was finished. Featuring the smash singles, \u201cWasted,\u201d and \u201cSpotlight,\u201d featuring Usher, The State Vs. Radric Davis was shaping up to be the biggest release of Gucci Mane\u2019s career. While he had already enjoyed plenty of success in the South and routinely made thousands of dollars for performing at shows every night, the album was projected to move him into the upper echelon of rap. He looked like he was primed to end the year on a positive note. Unfortunately, he had one more hurdle to clear\u2014and it was a big one.\n\nIn November 2009, just a few weeks before the album hit stores, Gucci Mane found himself getting thrown behind bars again for breaking the terms of his probation. It was devastating for his fans, his followers and, most importantly, himself.  \u201cUnfortunately, my incarceration also came at a pivotal point in my career, just as my first major label album was dropping,\u201d Gucci Mane admitted later. \u201cI was forced to miss what should have been one of the proudest moments of my life.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t let those moments go to waste, though. While in prison serving a one-year sentence, Gucci Mane wrote rhymes constantly, stayed in touch with his Brick Squad affiliates Waka Flocka Flame and DJ Holiday and set the stage for his return by releasing an official mixtape, The Burrrprint 2 HD, in March, which moved more than 15,000 units in its\u2019 first week in stores. All of this prepared Gucci Mane to get back on his grind when he released from prison in May.\n\nAnd grind he did. He released several notable mixtapes, including Jewelry Selection hosted by DJ Holiday in August and Ferrari Music hosted by DJ Drama in September, toured the country and also completed The Appeal\u2014his second major label album through So\/Icey\/Asylum\/Warner Bros. Records. With the help of a strong first single, \u201cGucci Time,\u201d featuring Swizz Beatz, and guest appearances from Ray J, Pharrell, Nicki Minaj, Wyclef and Bun B\u2014as well as production efforts from Drumma Boy, Zaytoven, and the Neptunes\u2014Gucci Mane proved that you might be able to lock him up, but you certainly can\u2019t lock him down.\n\nIt wasn't before long, however, that Gucci Mane was back in infamy's unforgiving life.  At the end of 2010 and beginning of the New Year, the rapper was involved in a series of well-publicized events including a relapse in his rehabilitation, being detained in a police raid, undergoing a psychiatric evaluation, and the acquisition of an uncanny face tattoo. \n\nBut it appears that Gucci Mane is now in a better place and is getting back to the music.  On March 22, the Atlanta enigma will release the next chapter in his series of street albums titled The Return of Mr. Zone 6, which will be available on online music stores as well as in local retailers.\n\n\"This street album is a return to the music that got me buzzin' in the first place,\" expresses Gucci Mane.  \"It didn't really make sense to not have some of the people who've been responsible for some of my best street records behind me.\"\n\nGucci Mane teamed up with long-time collaborator Drumma Boy to produce the majority of the album with producers Southside and Zaytoven each contributing a song to the 13-track release.  Features on the album include Brick Squad counterparts Waka Flocka Flame, OJ Da Juiceman, Cash Money\u2019s Birdman, Wale, Master P, Webbie, 8ball, Rocko and Wooh the Kid. \n\n\u201c2009 was a great year.  2010 was a hell of a year.  I\u2019m hoping 2011 will be a hell of a great year.  This project is going to set the tone for the new decade and I can\u2019t wait for the feedback from the supporters, haters and everyone in between.  I\u2019m back, yall.

While their individual formative roots ranged from producing drum & bass, breakbeat and hardcore, to playing in metal and punk bands, their comparable talents proved an unstoppable force when they managed to single-handedly conquer the world of drum & bass in their first 12 months together.\n\n\"We want our music to be an escape. While technology continues to constantly advance production techniques and (arguably) sound quality, something has been lost in the process - that original sense of self-escape, the idea of leaving yourself open to experience something you don't necessarily find in every-day life. That was the energy we picked up on and liked about electronic music when we first got into it. It felt like the same energy found with bands like Led Zeppelin and even The Beatles, and still occasionally today with bands like Tool, The Mars Volta, Queens Of The Stone Age and others.\n\nTo us, it made perfect sense to combine the best of both worlds, but it had to be done in a way that didn't make it sound obvious. In the last 10 years you've had all these bands that tried to cross the bridge by recruiting a turntablist \/ using a synthesizer on their new single, or electronic artists who just threw an obvious guitar sample into a tune...but eventually it just came across as a gimmick or a bit cheesy. We thought we'd try and do it properly, because to us it still hasn't been done right and theres a lot of room for exploration.\n\nIf you turn on the radio today you'll hear 20 tracks in a row describing someone's every-day life, or songs with a one-line catchphrase chorus about shaking your ass in the club - the production is usually great but when you look deeper, there's nothing behind it...it doesn't offer you anything past its face value. We want to hear something different and exciting, but the material we want to hear isn't getting made.

If you're    Selena Gomez, you dance. At least, you get the world on its feet with \"A Year Without Rain.\" A follow-up to \"Kiss & Tell,\" Selena\u2019s gold-certified Hollywood Records debut CD, \"A Year Without Rain\" shows Selena and her band, The Scene, in a whole new light, this one pulsating, multicolored and ready for the mirrored ball.\n \n\"I really wanted something that felt good to perform, but had a techno\/dance vibe,\" Selena says. \"I wanted something that had meaning and melody, and more empowering lyrics.\" That\u2019s exactly what she delivers in \"A Year Without Rain.\" Working with top producer\/songwriters like Tim James & Antonina Armato, Kevin Rudolf, Toby Gad and Jonas Jeberg, Selena kept to a more quickened tempo, exploring themes of love, freedom and the joy of living for the moment.\n \nSelena credits the album\u2019s neo-techno leanings to her 2010 platinum-certified single, \u2018Naturally,\" which pointed the way for her. That track \"really helped me figure out where I want to be,\" she says. \"There\u2019s a feeling when I perform that song that I love, so when I was going back in the studio, I had a better understanding of where I wanted to be musically.\"\n \nShe gets right to it with the opening track, \"Round & Round,\" an upbeat synth-driven song about reaching the limits of indecision in love. The plaintive \"A Year Without Rain\" may be more subdued, but its beauty impressed Selena enough to make it the title track. \"When I got the song, I went through the roof,\" she recalls. \"Everybody has that one person they can\u2019t live without. It was exactly what I wanted to say.\" That goes double for the Spanish version of the song, Selena\u2019s first recording in that language.  \n \nHaving turned 18 this year, Selena has matured since making her professional debut at age 7, but girls still wanna have fun, which is what songs like \"Spotlight\" \"Off the Chain\" and \"Summer\u2019s Not Hot\" are all about. \"Rock God\" features none other than Katy Perry on backing vocals, while \"Intuition\" boasts a duet between Selena and rapper Eric Bellinger in a tricked-out double-time salute to a positive attitude.\n \nSelena slows things down on \"Ghost of You,\" a ravishing ballad about a breakup so rough, no amount of \"living crazy loud\" can crush the memory. \"It\u2019s very beautiful, very raw,\" Selena says of the song. \"Shelly Peiken co-wrote it. She knows me, knows about everything I go through, and knows how to express it in a beautiful way.\"\n \nOn the flip side, Selena comes back strong with \"Sick of You,\" a Matt Squire-written and produced track about losing a loser (\"You know fairy tales don\u2019t come true\/ Not when it comes to you\"). The album ends with \"Live Like There\u2019s No Tomorrow,\" an epic power ballad expressing the creed by which Selena has built her life and career.\n \nA Dallas native, Selena Gomez started acting at age seven when she landed a role in the popular television series \"Barney & Friends,\" on which was a regular for two seasons. She landed her first film role in the 2003 sci-fi action adventure film \"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over.\" She made her mark as an actress playing girl wizard Alex Russo in the hit Disney Channel series \"Wizards of Waverly Place,\" which premiered in 2007 and has now completed three seasons. Selena and her cast mates won a 2009 Emmy Award for Outstanding Children\u2019s Program. \n \nSelena then made an indelible impression with her starring role in 2010 comedy \"Ramona and Beezus.\" Says Selena, \"I wanted something completely different from my show. All these incredible actors, being able to learn from them and get my feet wet in the film world. It was the perfect way to get into it.\" Next up, a starring role in \"Monte Carlo,\" in which she plays a teen on vacation in the romantic European principality. And of course, Selena is gearing up for the fourth season of \"Wizards of Waverly Place.\"\n \nSelena has branched out into fashion with the premiere of her new clothing line, Dream Out Loud, sold exclusively at K-Mart. But her instinct for charity remains strong. She is a proud UNICEF ambassador, and will appear for a third year at UNICEF's Trick or Treat bash, this time to kick off UNICEF's 60th anniversary. And with the new album comes a new tour with her band.\n \nHaving her own band has been a comfort for Selena as she hits the road with \"A Year Without Rain.\" Scene members; Ethan Roberts (Guitar), Joey Clement (Bass), Greg Garman (Drums) and Dane Forrest (Keyboard) back her on tour and help shape her emerging sound. \"On my TV show we have an ensemble cast that\u2019s like a family,\" she says. \"If anyone\u2019s missing, you feel it. I wanted that family feel in my music, and we definitely have that with the Scene.\"\n \nThat family feeling had grown to include fans around the world, each of them all in when it comes to following Selena Gomez on her amazing artistic journey. Where\u2019s she headed? She\u2019ll let you know when she gets there. \"I\u2019m still figuring out who I am,\" she says. \"I love expressing that through music, and through film. I feel at this moment in my life I couldn\u2019t be happier.\"\n","talking_about_count":1131078,"username":"Selena","website":"www.selenagomez.com www.youtube.com\/selenagomez www.myspace.com\/selenagomez www.twitter.com\/selenagomez www.facebook.com\/dreamoutloud ","were_here_count":0,"id":"7961985974","name":"Selena Gomez","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Selena","likes":49141465,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151742652665975","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1379878_10151742652665975_1271694451_n.jpg","offset_y":-100,"offset_x":0}}

With the release of 2001\u2019s White Blood Cells the band was thrust on magazine covers and captivating audiences through worldwide touring. \u201cFell in Love With a Girl\u201d served as the band\u2019s breakthrough hit and its accompanying Michel Gondry Lego clip was chosen by Pitchfork Media as the #1 music video of the 2000\u2019s.\n\nThe release of Elephant in 2003 not only cemented the band\u2019s reputation as a force to be reckoned with, but it also offered the hit \u201cSeven Nation Army\u201d which has since become appropriated as a de facto stadium chant for many sports teams the world over.\n\nIn 2004 White teamed up with Loretta Lynn to produce and perform on her Van Lear Rose album, an effort that won Grammy\u2019s for Best Country Album and Best Country collaboration with vocals for the single \u201cPortland, Oregon.\u201d To date White has won nine Grammys in seven different categories.\n\nWhite formed a \u201cnew band of old friends\u201d the Raconteurs in 2006 and their debut album Broken Boy Soldiers showed a markedly different side, most notably one where songwriting, vocal and guitar duties were shared. The success of their debut-single \u201cSteady, As She Goes\u201d proved that White\u2019s previous accomplishments were no fluke.\n\nTo take it even further, in 2009 White took to his original instrument, the drums, and started the Dead Weather with members of the Kills, Queens of the Stone Age and the Greenhornes. Releasing two albums in two years and unleashing a dark, captivating live show upon curious audiences, the Dead Weather futher-cemented Jack White\u2019s musical versatility and range.\n\nAlso in 2009, White opened the doors to his very own record label, Third Man Records, where he has produced over 120 records in less than three years. Spanning artists as varied as Jerry Lee Lewis, the Smoke Fairies, Wanda Jackson, Black Milk and Stephen Colbert, the label has quickly developed a reputation as a leader in the vinyl record industry.\n\nIn January 2012 White announced the upcoming release of his debut album Blunderbuss which will be accompanied by extensive touring across the world.","booking_agent":"N.

{"about":"Waka's new mixtape \"From Roaches to Rolex\" Is Now Available! Buy it on iTunes Here! http:\/\/smarturl.it\/fromroachestorollies","band_members":"Waka Flocka Flame","bio":"I never in my life wanted to rap. Let me quote that sh*t now.\u2014Waka Flocka Flame on his 2009 debut mixtape, Salute Me or Shoot Me, Vol. 1 \n \nWaka Flocka Flame didn\u2019t want to be a rapper when he grew up. He didn\u2019t want to write hit songs, perform in front of thousands of people at packed clubs or hear his songs played on radio stations across the country. But more than a year after bursting onto the scene with his debut single, \u201cO Let\u2019s Do It,\u201d the Atlanta rapper has managed to make more of an impact on the music industry than most rappers who have spent their entire lives trying to do it. And thanks to an influential cosign from fellow ATLien Gucci Mane, and a string of chart-topping singles, including the remix to \u201cO Let\u2019s Do It,\u201d featuring Rick Ross and Diddy, and his latest hit, \u201cHard In Da Paint,\u201d it doesn\u2019t look like Waka Flocka is ready to quit rapping anytime soon.\n \n\u201cI never dreamed I would be doing what I\u2019m doing today,\u201d says Waka, who earned his unique nickname from a cousin when he was younger while they were watching an episode of Jim Henson\u2019s classic puppet show, The Muppet Show (he later added the \u201cFlocka Flame\u201d to the end of it at the suggestion of Gucci Mane). \u201cI never imagined I\u2019d become a rapper, let alone a successful rapper.\u201d \n \nBorn Juaquin Malphurs in Queens, N.Y., Waka Flocka certainly had all the connections to forge into music at a young age. He grew up around the corner from Murda Inc. recording artist Ja Rule, lived near LL Cool J\u2019s grandmother and even had a cousin who used to hang around the popular group Lost Boyz in the mid-1990s. But when his mother Debra Mizay\u2014now the CEO of artist management group Mizay Entertainment\u2014relocated the family to Riverdale, Georgia when Waka was 11, he shied away from music and instead focused on his love for basketball. And after his youngest brother died in automobile accident when Waka was just 14, he moved even further away from it, instead opting to spend his time running the streets of Atlanta with his friends. \n \n\u201cThat whole period of my life really messed with my head,\u201d says Waka. \u201cI ain\u2019t even gonna lie\u2014it killed me as a man. But it also made me stronger as a man in the future.\u201d \n \nAt 18, Waka looked on as his mother began managing the career of Gucci Mane, who had established himself as a force to be reckoned with in Atlanta at the time by performing relentlessly throughout the South. Within two years, Waka began messing around with music himself alongside local producer Tay Beatz, who helped him shape his rambunctious personality on the microphone. \u201cI was going through so much at the time,\u201d says Waka. \u201cI had so much stress and so many issues. I couldn\u2019t release my emotions physically, so releasing them verbally was the only option I had.\u201d \n \nThe result was Waka\u2019s 2008 mixtape, Salute Me or Shoot Me, Vol. 1, featuring the trap anthem, \u201cO Let\u2019s Do It,\u201d a song that caught on instantaneously in the A and quickly spread to other parts of the country. It allowed Waka to take his show on the road and also earned him a coveted slot in Gucci Mane\u2019s 1017 Brick Squad clique. \u201cGucci and them were kind of shocked,\u201d says Waka, \u201cbecause nobody really knew I was rapping and then, all of a sudden, I had the biggest song in the South.\u201d \n \nBut all the sudden success also took its toll on Waka. In January 2010, he was shot several times at a car wash in Atlanta during an alleged robbery attempt. The following month, legendary East Coast artist Method Man was doing an interview on satellite radio and spoke out against Waka, criticizing the lack of lyricism involved in crafting his style of music. He also endured a short rift in his relationship with Gucci Mane recently after the rapper parted ways with his mother\u2019s management company in May. The incidents earned Waka a reputation as one of the most controversial artists in the industry\u2014a reputation that he doesn\u2019t feel he deserves. \n \n\u201cPeople have definitely gotten the wrong impression of me so far,\u201d says Waka. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they think I\u2019m so controversial. I guess people just don\u2019t know the real me yet. It\u2019s up to me to change their minds.\u201d \n \nHe\u2019s spent the better part of 2010 doing exactly that. Earlier this summer, he released \u201cHard In Da Paint,\u201d a catchy Lex Luger-produced track that inspired a slew of freestyles by other artists. He also put the finishing touches on his debut album, Flockaveli\u2014the first released through So Icey\/Asylum\/Warner Bros. Records. Featuring the rowdy intro, \u201cBustin\u2019 At \u2019Em,\u201d the strip club anthem, \u201cNo Hands,\u201d featuring Roscoe Dash and Wale, and the brutally-honest closing track, \u201cFuck This Industry,\u201d it promises to be one of the most energetic debut albums of the year. \n \nBy naming it Flockaveli, Waka\u2014who calls 2Pac his favorite rapper of all-time\u2014is also doing more than just being controversial for the sake of being controversial. \u201c2Pac introduced me to a guy named Machiavelli,\u201d says Waka. \u201cHis back was always to the wall and people threw sticks and stones at him and he had to keeping blocking them. When I recorded this album, that\u2019s how I felt.\u201d \n \nAnd if anyone doesn\u2019t like it? \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d says Waka. \u201cI\u2019m just going to keep on making my music.\u201d \n \nFor a guy who claims he never wanted to be a rapper, he\u2019s certainly come around to the idea. \n","category":"Musician\/band","influences":"Kebo gotti , Capp, B Cezzy, P Cezzy, Pimpmode, Dreco, CJ, T.O.Green, Hit Man, D Moss, Puncho, Lil Stacy, and D PLUS the whole HST WOOH DA KID, FRENCHIE, Juice Man And GUCCIIII","is_published":true,"record_label":"1017 Brick Squad\/Warner Bros.

Andre Tanneberger, however, has been making an impact for the past fifteen years. He may not have a secret recipe for success, but he is certainly one of those artists who succeeds in defying categorization. His tour diary ranges from the USA to Asia and back across the entire globe, taking in the world\u2019s biggest festivals like Electric Daisy Carnival, Creamfields and Nature One. He also has a residency at the world-famous Marquee Club in Las Vegas, USA.\n\nHis international gig diary could not be more varied, whilst his releases are consistently of the highest quality and are celebrated as such. Each of his eight artist albums bears his inimitable signature, the authentic ATB sound which evolves through time without pandering to trends. His authenticity is respected by artists all over the world, hence his pool of collaborators features the likes of Heather Nova, Moby, William Orbit, Roberta Carter Harrison, Jan L\u00f6chel, Haley, Betsy Larkin, Aruna, Rea Garvey (Reamonn), Jean Michel Jarre, Michael Cretu, Armin van Buuren, Dash Berlin, JanSoon, Sean Ryan, Melissa Loretta, Fuldner, Christina Soto, Kate Louise Smith and rudee.\n\nHis producer portfolio is complemented by two of his own compilation series which offer an exclusive insight into his DJ work. Since 2003, ATB\u2019s \u201cIn The Mix\u201d compilation series has offered a periodical snapshot of his current playlist, straight out of the world\u2019s finest clubs. In 2010, ATB compiled the first \u201cSunset Beach DJ Session\u201d, blending electronic dance music with the vibes of sun, sea and sand. A second CD presents the quieter, more ambient side of ATB, one of his great musical passions \u2013 which also merits space on his studio albums in the form of his own ATB productions.\n\nHis electrifying music thrills generation after generation in the fast-moving EDM scene all over the planet, as his packed tour diary testifies. ATB\u2019s albums and compilations invariably shoot to gold and platinum status within weeks. The most recent Sunset Beach DJ Session immediately claimed a spot in the top 5 of the sales charts. At the last count, 26 gold and 15 platinum discs hang on his studio wall.\n\nATB has always been known for getting close to his fans, as reflected by the numbers on his social media sites \u2013 in excess of one and a half million followers worldwide! His fans show their appreciation of this open exchange with their favourite artist by voting him into the upper echelons of DJ and dance music polls, each and every year.\n\nBehind the scenes, the next ATB productions and projects are in the final stages of preparation. The ninth studio album will be issued in the near future (around the turn of the year).\n\nBefore that, ATB celebrated his full live show ATB IN CONCERT for the first time in the US in Fall 2013. His tour stops were San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.\n\n2014 will also see the chilled side of ATB\u2019s sound reappear as \u201cATB \u2013 At The Beach\u201d .... so there is plenty to look forward to!","category":"Musician\/band","description":"Imprint:\n\nhttp:\/\/atb-music.com\/contact.php","influences":"********************************\n\nOFFICIAL ATB FACEBOOK PROFILE\n\n********************************\n\n\n","is_published":true,"press_contact":"thorsten\u0040dancefield.com","record_label":"Kontor","talking_about_count":26588,"username":"andretanneberger","website":"http:\/\/www.atb-music.com http:\/\/twitter.com\/atbandre http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/andretanneberger ","were_here_count":0,"id":"17452783116","name":"ATB","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/andretanneberger","likes":1382180,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152071527778117","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1477955_10152071527778117_1408232582_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":50}}

{"about":"Tech N9ne \"Something Else\" in stores now!\nPurchase now (iTunes) -  http:\/\/bit.ly\/16LZmIB\n","artists_we_like":"Jay Rock, Brotha Lynch Hung, Krizz Kaliko, Kutt Calhoun, Big Scoob, Stevie Stone, Mayday, Ces Cru, Young Bleed","bio":"Some artists get writers block, but for Tech N9ne, the ideas keep flowing. \n\nThat\u2019s why, more than a decade after he released his first nationally-distributed album, the pioneering Kansas City rapper decided to call his forthcoming studio album Something Else. \n\u201cAfter all this music, you have the nerve to say to the world that you have something else other than what we\u2019ve heard already, that\u2019s cocky,\u201d Tech N9ne says. \u201cI knew going into this album that it was going to have to be totally something else beatwise, contentwise and featurewise. I went in on a lot of stuff.\u201d\n\nTech N9ne delivers on his goals throughout Something Else, a rousing collection that takes listeners on an epic journey through Fire, Water and Earth sections of the album, a formatting tactic Tech N9ne also employed on his landmark Anghellic album in 2001 and his Everready [The Religion] album in 2006.  \n\u201cStraight Out The Gate\u201d kicks off the intense Fire section of the album. Featuring System Of A Down\u2019s Serj Tankian, the song has political and religious overtones while highlighting both Tankian and Tech N9ne\u2019s talents. \u201cSerj, he\u2019s a guy that takes chances with music and sounds and fuses them together and that\u2019s how I feel about my hip-hop music,\u201d Tech N9ne says. \u201cOur being on a song together, that\u2019s one of the biggest things that could happen. That\u2019s why I put it first on the album.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Tech keeps the intensity level sky-high with \u201cB.I.T.C.H.,\u201d an acronym for \u201cBreaking Into Colored Houses,\u201d a cut about his interaction with his black fans. \u201cLove 2 Dislike Me\u201d discusses the aftermath of a relationship gone sour, while \u201cFortune Force Field\u201d explains how certain people are trying to keep Tech N9ne from enjoying all the fruits of his musical labor.  Then there\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Not A Saint,\u201d Tech N9ne\u2019s latest look at his Evil Brain Angel Heart persona. \n\nTech N9ne embraces such personal, evocative subject matter because it is an innate part of his artistry. \u201cThe reason I opened up on this album is because throughout my career, all I\u2019ve been doing is being inside out, being an open book,\u201d he says. \u201cSince the album is called Something Else, I have to let certain things loose that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t let loose.\u201d\n\nThe same logic applies to \u201cFragile,\u201d a fierce collaboration with Kendrick Lamar, \u00a1Mayday! and Kendall Morgan. Here, the artists blast uninformed critics who lack the perspective and qualifications to fully and accurately evaluate their craft. Tech N9ne also introduces spirited newcomer Angel Davanport on \u201cPriorities,\u201d which also features Game.  \n\nAs the Water section of the album arrives, the selections become calmer, if only thematically. \u201cDwamn\u201d introduces the album\u2019s first party vibe, while \u201cSo Dope (They Wanna)\u201d with Wrekonize, Snow Tha Product and Twisted Insane, is the latest of Tech N9ne\u2019s posse cuts highlighting rappers who excel at rapid-fire rapping, or chopping.  \u201cSee Me,\u201d with Wiz Khalifa and B.o.B., showcases Tech N9ne\u2019s ability as an independent artist to conceive and execute independent albums with major label artists and with a major label feel. That\u2019s also why this song\u2019s lyrics focus on people overlooking Tech N9ne\u2019s remarkable achievements \u2013 that he\u2019s sold more than 2 million units independently, developed into to one of music\u2019s most dependable touring artists and that he\u2019s built Strange Music into one of rap\u2019s most successful imprints from his hometown of Kansas City. \n\nAs Something Else advances to the Earth section, Tech N9ne focuses on topics he hopes will make the world better. \u201cThat\u2019s My Kid,\u201d with CeeLo Green, Big K.R.I.T. and Kutt Calhoun, for instance, finds Tech N9ne contemplating the recent rash of school shootings and realizing how fortunate he is that his children did not make some of the mistakes that he did as a child. \u201cI was just sitting up one day looking at all these kids that do these heinous things, these horrible things,\u201d Tech N9ne says. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that my son didn\u2019t latch on to the Blood gang nonsense that I grew up doing. He latched on to music and now he wants to rap. I\u2019m blessed. I have to rejoice.\u201d \n\nTech N9ne also rejoiced on the career-defining song \u201cStrange 2013,\u201d his collaboration with The Doors. Tech N9ne named his Strange Music label with partner Travis O\u2019Guin after the icon rock group\u2019s songs \u201cStrange Days\u201d and \u201cPeople Are Strange.\u201d As a black fan of rock and rap growing up in Missouri, Tech N9ne grew up thinking he was \u201cstrange\u201d. Getting to work with the surviving members of The Doors on \u201cStrange 2013,\u201d a reworking of \u201cStrange Days,\u201d is one of the proudest moments of his groundbreaking career. \n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for their fusion of music, I would have never told Travis I wanted to call the joint venture that we have Strange Music,\u201d Tech N9ne explains. \u201cThat\u2019s why \u2018Strange 2013\u2019 meant so much to me. Now, when I listen to it, I smile, like, \u2018I did that.\u2019 They\u2019re the ones that inspired me. It\u2019s the thing keeping me alive and putting my kids through college, because I was a Doors fan.\u201d \n\nToday, millions of people are Tech N9ne fans. He became known as an innovative rapper in the 1990s because of his trendsetting ability to rap at breakneck speed, to rap backwards and, soon thereafter, to also deliver riveting personal songs that examined his own inner demons, as evidenced throughout such memorable cuts as \u201cTormented\u201d and \u201cReal Killer.\u201d In the 2000s, Tech N9ne hit the road relentlessly, becoming one of rap\u2019s premier touring acts. \n\nWith 2012\u2019s \u201cHostile Takeover 2012 Tour,\u201d Tech N9ne holds the title of headlining the longest continuous tour in rap history. Even with all these accolades and the impressive list of artists Tech N9ne features on Something Else, he sounds as fresh and hungry as he did when he first started releasing music commercially more than a decade ago. \u201cI\u2019ve got a chip on my shoulder,\u201d Tech N9ne says. \u201cI\u2019ve still got a lot to prove. That\u2019s why I still rap so hard. I\u2019m always trying to get better and better. I\u2019m not softening it.\u201d\n\nThat, in and of itself, is Something Else indeed.\n\n","booking_agent":"booking\u0040strangemusicinc.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Kansas City, MO","general_manager":"Travis O'Guin","genre":"Hip-Hop \/ Rap \/ Independent","hometown":"Kansas City, MO","is_published":true,"record_label":"Strange Music, Inc.","talking_about_count":80023,"username":"therealTechN9ne","website":"http:\/\/blog.therealtechn9ne.com http:\/\/www.therealtechn9ne.com http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/techn9ne http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/techn9ne","were_here_count":0,"id":"34366716606","name":"Tech N9ne","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/therealTechN9ne","likes":2191932,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151678617491607","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1454770_10151678617491607_1404627102_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

The arrival of his instant-classic mixtape \u2018Rich Forever\u2019 \u2013 a self-released behemouth that some are calling the best rap of the year thusfar \u2013 and the constant barrage of new material, features and online content that he and his MMG cohorts flood the streets with daily, has taken Ross to a new level.\n\"We believe that Rick Ross is among the elite; one of the most talented and compelling artists in the industry,\" said Def Jam Recordings president Joie Manda. \"He's done an amazing job of building his brand and image, and together with Def Jam's promotional muscle and marketing savvy, we intend to elevate Ross' stature across the board. It's an exciting time to be in the Rick Ross business.\"\n \n\"There's Jay-Z, Kanye, and Wayne\u2014and Eminem is the king of his own domain,\" Rap Radar\u2019s Elliott Wilson recently told GQ. \"And then there's Rick Ross, right on that cusp.\"\n \nNot content with the cusp, and thoroughly determined to dominate the conversation, Ross has bossed up and partnered with the superstar Usher for his new single \u201cTouch\u2019N You.\u201d Released to radio and online yesterday, the Rico Love-produced banger is the lead single from \u2018God Forgives,\u2019 and sets the tone for what will be Ross\u2019 most epic, most ambitious album to date.\n \n\u201cBefore I was ever in this position, I promised myself I would never take it for granted,\u201d Ross told the expectant crowd gathered at his Manhattan press conference. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I did with this project\u2026it\u2019s my best body of work yet. God Forgives, I Don\u2019t is a very dark story\u2026it\u2019s extremely lyrical. The music is next level. I\u2019m expecting nothing but the biggest results. That\u2019s what\u2019s needed, and I\u2019m going to deliver\u201d\n \nStay tuned for more on hip-hop\u2019s biggest boss, Rick Ross, and the most-anticipated album of the year\u2026God Forgives, I Don\u2019t.\n","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Hip-Hop\/Rap","hometown":"Miami, FL","is_published":true,"record_label":"Def Jam Recordings\/ Maybach Music Group","release_date":"7\/31\/2012","talking_about_count":24821,"username":"rickross","website":"rozayraw.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"106672932712721","name":"Rick Ross","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/rickross","likes":5642802,"cover":{"cover_id":585354668177876,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/1185127_585354668177876_97433727_n.jpg","offset_y":50,"offset_x":0}}

It was there, at the dawn of the punk movement in April 1977, that the Misfits were born. Taking for their name the title of Marilyn Monroe's final movie, they set out to make an impression. They wound up making history and creating a legacy that has truly withstood the test of time. Today, boasting a massive catalog of music old and new, a new lineup and an influence felt around the world, the Misfits are generating more interest than ever before.\n\nFrom its inception, the Misfits were primal. Their music was aggressive, confrontational and dangerous with violent lyrics as seen through the eyes of a monster, coupled with timeless vocal melodies bred from 1950\u2019s rock and roll. Immortalizing black and white B horror films in their music, the Misfits developed a ghoulish and totally unique persona; from their hand made musical weapons to the stiletto hairstyle they called the \u201cdevil lock.\u201d It was the early days of punk and they had created a rebellion all their own.\n\nOver thirty years on, the Misfits have endured hardcore\u2019s heyday as punk rock\u2019s monster squad, a band whose cult following \u2013 a pseudo-secret coven known as the Fiend Club \u2013 inspired them to continue to write, record and tour. These \u201cFiends\u201d (as their fans are known), which are still multiplying globally, go back now several generations and also includes many artists. In fact, bands across the spectrum of rock have offered their tribute by covering the band\u2019s material, including Guns \u2018n Roses, with the classic Misfits song \"Attitude;\" My Chemical Romance who revisited the classic \u201cAstro Zombies\u201d for the soundtrack to \u201cTony Hawk\u2019s American Wasteland\u201d video game, and Metallica who covered no less than three Misfits songs on their double CD set \"Garage Days Revisited,\" while hailing the band as a key influence on their music. A tribute album entitled VIOLENT WORLD featured the likes of Prong, NOFX and Sick of It All.\n\nThe iconic \"Fiend Skull,\" (the official symbol of the group), which was once crudely painted on their equipment, leather jackets and everything they could get their hands on, has since become a staple in pop culture, and an instantly recognizable symbol worldwide. Highly collectible and sought after, Misfits memorabilia has appeared in films and on television and continues to be worn publicly by actors, musicians and athletes who acknowledge the band\u2019s cool factor. Asked why this hunger for all things Misfits endured, Jerry Only ventures \"I think we created a niche. We stuck to what we did, and we did it well. We never tried to pull something over on people - we just tried to entertain 'em while rocking 'em real hard. Besides, I think the love of the horror art form has endured.\u201d The impact of the Misfits and their music on pop culture has become a phenomenon in and of itself.\n\nAfter a split with former singer Glenn Danzig in the mid 1980's and a decade-long legal battle, The Misfits was resurrected by founding member Jerry Only, returning stronger than ever with their first album of new material, \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d. Released in 1997 on Geffen Records and debuting at #117 on Billboard\u2019s Top 200, the CD reestablished the Misfits as one of the most aggressive and still relevant outfits in modern rock history. \u201cIt was great making a new record and getting back in touch with our fans,\u201d says Only. \"Sticking to our punk roots, the longest song on the album is three minutes and nine cuts are under two. We still had the classic backup vocals, the '50s sounding chord progressions, the different beats, but the sound of our instrumentation was way better than what was possible when we started out.\"\n\nThe music videos for \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d, (\"Dig Up Her Bones\" & \"American Psycho\" directed by John Cafiero) could be found topping the charts on music television outlets throughout the world, within the then-uncharted territory of online entertainment, as well as on the big screen. Theatrical screenings ran in film festivals both in and outside the U.S. garnering \"Best of Fest\" nods as well as award nominations from the Horror Writers Association. The Misfits and their \"Fiend Club\" also became instrumental in petitioning for the release of the U.S. Classic Movie Monster Stamp series which, among other of their heroes, featured Bela Lugosi Sr., as Dracula, Ben Chapman as the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and of course, Boris Karloff as Frankenstein.\n\nThe Misfits\u2019 follow-up album, \u201cFamous Monsters\u201d, was released in 1999 on Roadrunner Records and went on to become one of the biggest selling titles ever for Roadrunner Japan, debuting at #138 on Billboard\u2019s Top 200. The supporting music video \"Scream\" (which featured the band as zombies) was directed by George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead), who offered his services in exchange for two original Misfits songs to be featured (along with the band itself) in his film \"Bruiser\". Even the toy industry took notice, bestowing the honor of \"Action Figure of the Year\" to the 12\" G.I. Joe-styled Jerry Only action figure which was released at that time. In the year 2000, the Misfits were named #91 in VH-1's \"100 Greatest Hard Rock Bands of all Time\".\n\nThematically, the band\u2019s music continued to focus on their time-honored fascination with vampires, monsters, and alien invasion. \u201cWe are the Misfits after all,\" warns Only about the band's refusal to address worldly issues, he explains, \"fiends who buy our records and come to see us perform enter another world - from the guy all the way back in the balcony, to the guy getting his head banged around in the front - they come to have a good time. And we make sure they have it. They can hear about social and political issues somewhere else.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, the band released MISFITS PROJECT 1950. The album includes special guests appearances by Ronnie Spector, Blondie\u2019s Jimmy Destri, and many more, showcasing punk covers of 50\u2019s era classics like \"This Magic Moment\" (Jay and the Americans), \"Dream Lover\" (Bobby Darin) and \"Donna\" (Richie Valens). Only, who had the project in mind for many years, says \"the backbone of punk has always been the 3-chord progression which was ultimately inspired by classic rock and roll of the 1950's. I had always wanted to record some of the music that inspired the Misfits, to show fiends where it all began.\" Released independently on the newly formed Misfits Records label imprint, the CD debuted on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart at #2, and Billboard's Top Independent album chart at #5. Notably the highest charting release in the entire 30-plus year legacy of the Misfits, \u201cProject 1950\u201d also marked the first full-length release to feature Jerry Only on both lead vocals and Bass, with former Black Flag alum Dez Cadena on guitar.\n\nToday, The Misfits remain more aggressive, more topical and more sought after than ever before, fronted by Jerry Only (Bass\/Vocals) with Dez Cadena on guitar, (celebrating his 10th anniversary in the band as of 2011), with the latest addition to the\nfiendish fold; drummer Eric \"Chupacabra\" Arce behind the kit. Arce, or \u201cChupacabra\u201d as he\u2019s now known, has been a fixture in the \u2018Fits touring lineup for over a decade, and recently inducted a permanent member upon the retirement of original Misfits drummer Robo, who\u2019d passed the torch in 2010. \n\nNow, the \u2018Fits return with their first full-length release of all-new, original material in nearly a decade! Rooted in the horror and sci-fi themes their audience craves, \u201cTHE DEVIL\u2019S RAIN\u201d showcases 16 fiendish, soon-to-be Misfits classics including \u201cTwilight of the Dead\u201d, \u201cDark Shadows\u201d, \u201cCurse of the Mummy\u2019s Hand\u201d and the title track \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Rain\u201d. Produced by Ed Stasium, (who\u2019s credits include the Ramones\u2019 \u201cRoad to Ruin\u201d and \u201cToo Tough to Die\u201d, as well as the Misfits\u2019 1999 release \u201cFamous Monsters\u201d), the album showcases a jaw-dropping, two-panel front\/back cover painting featuring the rebirth of the band\u2019s iconic \u201cFiend\u201d mascot in an epic setting rendered by Arthur Suydam (known for his immensely popular work on the Marvel Zombies series, among others). The packaging, designed to emulate a CD sized gatefold LP, also features some incredible new Misfits portraits shot by the legendary Mick Rock. Rock\u2019s imagery has become part of the very fabric of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Having also served as an on-set photographer for cult-movie classic \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show\u201d, Rock lends a perfectly suited eye to view the band\u2019s surrealistic and highly theatrical persona. \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Rain\u201d is not just a continuation of a historic legacy, it\u2019s a total reboot ushering in a new era of terror. In a sense, it\u2019s the debut album from the legendary Misfits of this decade. From fans of their classics, to newcomers discovering the band for the very first time, \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Rain\u201d sets the bar, and redefines the ferocity and melody that has made the Misfits omnipresent and immortal.\n\nThe band continues to sell out shows and draw thousands of fans night after night around the globe. \u201cWhen fans come to a Misfits show, they get a band who gets up there and gives them all they\u2019ve got,\u201d says Only. \u201cWe give them the real thing - that\u2019s how we\u2019ve always done it. At a show, everyone's just part of the band, there's no them and us - we're all us.\u201d It is this inclusive approach and attitude of dedication and devotion to fans that have kept the group alive.\n\nAside from an inventive approach to music and its intense and extraordinary visual presentation, the Misfits\u2019 all-encompassing and fierce DIY mentality continues to drive their efforts. From their compound in the far reaches of North Jersey, which includes a family owned machine shop  and appropriately enough a knife factory, they craft their own instruments \u2013 from their guitars, amps and drums - down to the studded leather straps and even their spiked leather jackets. Creativity rules as they design and construct their own elaborate stage sets and wide array of infamous props.\n\nThe Misfits have been preserved on determination bound by unequaled loyalty to their fiends and the sheer will to survive. \"Its been over 30 years and 30 years from now, people will still be playing our albums because we will never water down what we do,\u201d Only says. \u201cOur goal is to keep perspective on who we are and always stay true to ourselves. The new album will only reinforce how potent the band has become with time. We plan to continue as always, to eclipse the past, block the sun and drag humanity by the throat into a world of darkness filled with ghouls, goblins and creatures of the night, where we are king.\"\n\nOne thing is certain, The Misfits are here to stay and once again, every day is Halloween.","booking_agent":"Artists Worldwide  http:\/\/www.artists-worldwide.com\/","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Punk","hometown":"New Jersey","is_published":true,"record_label":"Misfits Records www.misfitsrecords.com","talking_about_count":18335,"username":"Misfits","website":" http:\/\/misfits.com\/ http:\/\/misfits.cinderblock.com\/ http:\/\/misfitsrecords.com\/ http:\/\/twitter.com\/themisfits http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/themisfits","were_here_count":0,"id":"67577810787","name":"Misfits","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Misfits","likes":1856796,"cover":{"cover_id":"10153579923885788","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/1471984_10153579923885788_1095549971_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":80}}

My family didn\u2019t have a lot of money to take vacations, so for me to have that kind of experience was surreal.\u201d\n\nIt was just one of many extraordinary moments this unassuming 24-year-old Midwesterner would have over the past 18 months thanks to the blockbuster success of Owl City\u2019s major-label debut album \u2014 the lush, lovingly created Ocean Eyes, which was released by Universal Republic Records in July 2009. Filled with whimsical melodies and blissful beats that Young conjured up alone in the basement of his parents\u2019 home in Owatonna, Ocean Eyes topped the Billboard Rock, Alternative, and Dance\/Electronic charts and was certified gold or platinum in nine countries, including platinum in the U.S. The album spawned the quadruple-platinum first single \u201cFireflies,\u201d which was a No. 1 smash hit in 24 countries including the U.S. (where it hit the top spot twice), and sold more than four million downloads. Its eye-popping success has made Owl City an international phenomenon, selling nearly 12 million tracks worldwide and amassing an impressive touring record, including support stints with Maroon 5 and John Mayer, and sold-out headlining tours in which Young, backed by a five-piece band, performed for besotted fans in the U.S., Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.\n\nYoung\u2019s adventures over the past two years are evocatively detailed on the impossibly catchy electro-pop songs that make up Owl City\u2019s new album, All Things Bright and Beautiful. \u201cOcean Eyes was written from the perspective of my bedroom,\u201d Young says. \u201cAll I could do was imagine how I\u2019d feel if I could visit all these places I was writing about. This time around, I was influenced by very specific things and was able to draw upon what I\u2019d been through, so that got poured into the lyrics and the moods of the songs. The music always dictates the lyrics. I just sit down at the piano and think about things and it happens in front of me.\u201d \n\nOn All Things Bright and Beautiful, the music and lyrics conspire to make listeners feel as if they were stepping into another world \u2014 a verdant musical dreamland where \u201creality is a lovely place, but I wouldn\u2019t want to live there,\u201d as Young sings on the opening track \u201cThe Real World.\u201d Images of abundance, like a backyard of butterflies (\u201cHoney and the Bee\u201d), blossoms filling a room (\u201cHospital Flowers\u201d), and \u201csunsets that dazzle in the dusk\u201d (\u201cDreams Don\u2019t Turn To Dust\u201d) unfold alongside starry-eyed imaginings of cherry bombs staining blackbirds red (\u201cKamikaze\u201d) and dipping one\u2019s toes in the galaxy (\u201cAlligator Sky\u201d).\n\nYoung opens the album with \u201cThe Real World\u201d because, for him, it serves as a partial commentary on his fanciful nature. \u201cNot that I want to check out from what\u2019s going on around me,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut I\u2019m the guy who\u2019ll lie awake at night and have these wakeful dreams, like a movie director who\u2019s creating this film in my head, and that is so inspiring. It\u2019s worth more than anything that\u2019s ever happened to me in person. So that song is kind of an embodiment of what life could be like if I were in a different place.\u201d Interestingly, Young follows \u201cThe Real World\u201d with \u201cDeer in the Headlights,\u201d a playful song about feeling the pressure to be the perfect guy. \u201cIt\u2019s my way of telling myself, \u2018Wake up, nothing will ever be that perfect.\u2019 I put those songs back to back to say that you can stay in one world and be happy, but often what\u2019s real is much different than what you perceive to be ideal.\u201d  \n\nAnother highlight is the first single, \u201cAlligator Sky,\u201d which features Los Angeles rapper Shawn Chrystopher. \u201c\u2019Alligator\u2019 and \u2018sky\u2019 are two words that don\u2019t really go together, but conjure up an image, which fits the idea of the song,\u201d Young says. \u201cIt\u2019s about how there are so many weird things coming at you every day. Why not just meet them head on and take charge even though you have no say over what\u2019s going to happen? You and those around you are what matter most.\u201d\n\nThrough each song, even the more melancholy ones, such as \u201cDreams Don\u2019t Turn To Dust\u201d and \u201cPlant Life\u201d (on which Young sings about wishing plant life would grow all around him \u201cso I won\u2019t feel dead anymore\u201d), Young retains his ever-present optimism, letting the listener know that no matter how tough times get, there\u2019s always light at the end of the tunnel. \u201cI would feel weird if I were to communicate anything other than optimism, because it\u2019s just who I am,\u201d Young says. \u201cIt's always been in me to make Owl City a vehicle that sends a hopeful message. As a listener, I'm drawn to things that are really uplifting. When a certain melody grabs my ear, it makes me feel like I could be a better person.\u201d \n\nAll Things Bright and Beautiful also finds Young expanding his sonic palette, playing around with a harder-edged vocal delivery on \u201cKamikaze,\u201d majestic strings on \u201cDreams Don\u2019t Turn To Dust,\u201d euphoric dancefloor tempo on \u201cThe Yacht Club\u201d (featuring guest vocals by Canadian singer Lights), and straight-up piano pop on \u201cPlant Life\u201d (which Young wrote with Relient K\u2019s Matthew Thiessen). The experimentation comes from Young\u2019s evolving confidence as a songwriter, musician, producer, and engineer. As with Ocean Eyes, Young produced and engineered the album himself (before mixing it together with veteran mixer Jack Joseph Puig). \u201cFor the actual production of the album, tonality and texture played a larger part,\u201d Young says. \u201cI knew I wanted it sound bigger and be more dynamic than Ocean Eyes, so I put more time into trying to figure out how to do my job better from a technical standpoint. I had to polish up my knowledge so I could bring the sounds I heard in my head to life.\u201d\n\nYoung has come a long way since his days posting his musical experiments on MySpace and YouTube, launching both an online savvy and radio-friendly career that the New York Times called \u201ca textbook illustration of how the music business needs new and old forms of media to make an artist a star.\u201d Before becoming an Internet sensation (racking up more than 98 million total plays on MySpace and more than 18.5 million channel views on Owl City\u2019s Vevo\/YouTube channel to date), Young, the only child of a mechanic and a schoolteacher, was attending community college and working dead-end jobs, including one in a warehouse loading Coca-Cola trucks. He began creating melodies and beats on his laptop as a way to combat insomnia and eventually self-released an EP, 2007\u2019s Of June and an album, 2008\u2019s Maybe I\u2019m Dreaming, both of which reached the Top 20 on Billboard\u2019s Electronic Albums chart. \n\nImpressed by Young\u2019s connection to his grassroots audience, Universal Republic signed Owl City in early 2008 and stepped back to watch his creativity flourish. He has also released music under the moniker Sky Sailing, and appeared on a track on Dutch producer Armin van Buuren\u2019s 2010 album Mirage. Last year, 300 and Watchmen and director Zack Snyder asked Young to write the theme song for his animated film Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga-Hoole. \u201cTo The Sky\u201d anchors the film\u2019s soundtrack, which also includes the score by Academy Award nominee Davis Hirschfelder.  \n\nFor now, however, Young\u2019s attention is focused on Owl City, which will hit the road for a U.S. tour in June 2011 following the May 17th release of All Things Bright and Beautiful. Forced to overcome his shyness and trepidation about performing live, Young is now enthusiastic about touring and showing up for his fans. \u201cThe gratification you get from flying across the world and playing to a sold-out room full of kids who know all your lyrics, even if they don\u2019t speak your language, is incredible,\u201d Young says. \u201cIt\u2019s those times when you stand back and say, \u2018I\u2019m just a normal guy, I can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n","booking_agent":"Creative Artists Agency","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Owatonna, MN","general_manager":"Foundations Artist Management","genre":"Electronica\/Pop","hometown":"Owatonna, MN","influences":"Rachel Joy Scott, Audrey Hepburn, C.S.

He knows how it can inspire, uplift and make people want to dance or cry.

For the first time, Franti reached out to collaborate with various writers and producers. \n\n\u201cIt was like speed dating,\u201d Franti says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a limited amount of time to write the greatest song you\u2019ve ever heard. But when it works, it\u2019s magic.\u201d\n\nThe chemistry is evident on collaborations with multi-platinum Australian producer\/songwriter Adrian Newman, who co-wrote \u201cLong Ride Home,\u201d \u201cCloser To You,\u201d \u201cSay Goodbye\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Alive (Life Sounds Like)\u201d, as well as with the seven-time Grammy-nominated Canadian production team The Matrix, who produced and co-wrote the tracks \u201c11:59\u201d and \u201cOn and On.\u201d \n\nSam Hollander, another collaborator who has worked with chart-topping acts like Train, One Direction and Katy Perry, came on for the songs \u201cWherever You Are\u201d and \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Go.\u201d Franti says, \u201cHe also comes from a similar musical experience as I do, growing up when rap, punk and reggae were merging. But he also really knows the pop realm.\u201d\n\nNot that Franti has completely left behind the world of the 24-hour news cycle. His outrage can be heard on tracks like \u201c11:59\u201d and \u201cSay Goodbye,\u201d which was inspired by the Trayvon Martin shooting. Instead, Franti has both widened his scope of the world and pulled in closer for his most intimate moments. \n\nMany of the love songs on All People are born from his relationship with his partner Sara.  \u201cThese songs are about the power of unconditional love, born out of tough times.  It\u2019s rare to find someone who accepts you being your own authentic self.  In the past I didn\u2019t always give space for the broad spectrum of emotion, but this time I made an effort to write about everything I experience.\u201d\n\nMore than ever, the songwriter looked to his primary influences for inspiration, referencing the wide range of work by music icons like John Lennon, Bob Marley, Johnny Cash, Marvin Gaye and the Clash. Of the sound on All People Franti says, \u201cMy favorite artists were great at pop form.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve changed what I do.  I just realized I can do it simpler and more direct.\u201d\n\nFranti and his band Spearhead are known for the communal spirit they create with their extraordinary live shows. The singer regularly brings down the barrier between the performers on stage and the people in the audience; whether venturing into the crowd to slap hands or pulling fans up to dance, sing and play along with the band. He\u2019s a dynamic performer who effortlessly moves tens of thousands of people with his invocations. Watching him, you can't help but think about how much he delights in every moment.\n\nFrom his beginnings in the post-punk band the Beatings and critically acclaimed hip-hop group Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy (who toured with U2 and Public Enemy) Franti has remained a devoted defender of the underdog. \n\nFor a decade, Franti hosted the Power to the Peaceful free concerts in San Francisco, at first to support incarcerated political activist Mumia Abu Jamal, then as a platform to speak out against escalating violence around the globe. He\u2019s made several trips to hot spots in the Middle East to see war\u2019s human toll with his own eyes. In 2005, he made the film \u201cI Know I\u2019m Not Alone\u201d about his travels through Iraq, Palestine and Israel.\n\n\u201cI made a commitment to myself years ago that I wouldn\u2019t just read about what was happening in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI needed to go and experience it.\u201d\n\nIt was on these trips that he realized people don\u2019t necessarily want to hear songs that bluntly address the ills of the world but rather songs that will offer them some escape from their difficulties. \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to live in a society where anger is a force that gets things done,\u201d Franti says. \u201cSome people react by throwing a trash can through a window. I\u2019d rather go play music in a school, prison or war zone. Those are the ways I choose to affect change.\u201d\n\nThe same week his 2009 smash \u201cSay Hey (I Love You)\u201d broke, eventually selling over 2-million downloads, Franti\u2019s appendix ruptured and put him in the hospital close to death. It was another moment that changed his perspective on songwriting, leading to the triumphant tone of All People.  \n\n\u201cI want to make music that is timeless,\u201d Franti says. \u201cAt this point in my life when I turn on the radio and hear my song it means a lot to me. When I was a kid I would go on these long drives with my family I and still remember the songs we would listen to in the car. It means I\u2019m part of somebody\u2019s life passages. As an artist, I cherish those moments.\u201d\n\n","booking_agent":"Creative Artists Agency www.caa.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"San Francisco","general_manager":"Borman Entertainment & Guerrilla Managment","genre":"Roots \/ Rock \/ Reggae \/ Hip-Hop \/ Soul \/ Funk \/ Pop","hometown":"San Francisco","influences":"Spearhead\nDisposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy\nThe Beatnigs","is_published":true,"press_contact":"PFA MEDIA (www.pfamedia.net)","record_label":"EMI\/Capitol Records, Liberator AUS, Village Again JP","talking_about_count":13295,"username":"michaelfranti","website":"http:\/\/www.powertothepeaceful.org","were_here_count":0,"id":"10364496359","name":"Michael Franti and Spearhead","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/michaelfranti","likes":311339,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151466401526360","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1044356_10151466401526360_551043032_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Not that they\u2019ve ever tackled any aspects of their career with a half-baked attitude, but the approach was particularly important after four years of creative silence.\n\n\u201cKhaos Legions\u201d was well worth the wait. A solid 14 tracks \u2013 11 songs and three instrumental passages \u2013 it is an album that immediately recalls \u201cAnthems Of Rebellion\u201d (2003) and \u201cDoomsday Machine\u201d (2005), considered by many to be ARCH ENEMY\u2019s two strongest outings to date. Loaded with the Amott brothers\u2019 trademark guitar shred, spearheaded by vocalist Angela Gossow\u2019s instantly recognizable hell-hath-no-fury delivery, all backed by the Sharlee D\u2019Angelo \/ Daniel Erlandsson bass \/ drum high energy stomp, \u201cKhaos Legions\u201d features the band\u2019s trademark extreme metal execution coupled with some eyebrow-raising surprises along the way.\n\nEight studio albums and 15 years into their career, \u201cKhaos Legions\u201d is ARCH ENEMY\u2019s iron \u201cYou are here!\u201d stamp that hits like a ton of bricks.\n \nSimply put, no diehard ARCH ENEMY fan should go away dissatisfied. The tracks \u2018Yesterday Is Dead And Gone,\u2019 \u2018Under Black Flags We March,\u2019 \u2018Thorns In My Flesh\u2019 and \u2018City Of The Dead\u2019 are examples of the five-piece wrecking crew people have come to expect. \u2018Bloodstained Cross\u2019 features Michael and Chris Amott exploring new shred-head territory, while \u2018Cruelty Without Beauty,\u2019 \u2018Cult Of Chaos\u2019 and the scathing \u2018Vengeance Is Mine\u2019 feature some of the most aggressive work from the band to date.\n\n\u2018Through The Eyes Of A Raven\u2019 is easily the band\u2019s most adventurous song in years, progressive and dark, and with what Amott describes as having \u201ca Scandinavian feel to it, with a melancholic Nordic thing going on in the chorus.\u201d It is certainly a different side of the band, yet they retain every ounce of trademark aggression.\n\nThe biggest surprise is the bordering-on-death-rock \u2018No Gods, No Masters,\u2019 a definite echo of ARCH ENEMY\u2019s anthem \u2018We Will Rise\u2019 that is guaranteed to raise the ire of some fans as it is embraced by others. \n\nPress all over the world hailed \u201cKhaos Legions\u201d as one of the best metal albums of 2011, and the band was featured on covers including Terrorizer (UK), Metal Hammer (Germany), Aardschok (Netherlands), Rock Hard (France), Burrn (Japan), Inferno (Finland), Close-Up (Sweden) and many more.\n\nSince the release of the album, ARCH ENEMY have played the biggest European festivals \u2013 including Graspop (Belgium), Sonisphere (UK, Sweden and Spain), Tuska (Finland), Summerbreeze (Germany) and more \u2013 and did an extended US tour (supported by Devildriver, Skeletonwitch and Chthonic) followed by a European tour (supported by Warbringer and Chthonic). They\u2019ve toured the world in support of \u201cKhaos Legions\u201d: Japan, Australia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and many other places you wouldn\u2019t expect a metal band to go.\n\nIn between, ARCH ENEMY found time to support Amnesty International and Peta2 with special campaigns that clearly show that they stand 100\u0025 behind their message \u2013 because action speaks louder than words.\n\nIn early 2012 ARCH ENEMY amicably parted ways with guitarist Christopher Amott. Christopher Amott was a member of ARCH ENEMY between 1996-2005 and again between 2007-2011. His replacement was found in 26-year-old American guitarist Nick Cordle from the US band Arsis. Michael Amott comments: \u201cNick was my first choice as he ticks all the right boxes for Arch Enemy with his musicality and technicality as well as his personality and dedication. Looking forward to having him join us on stage, the rehearsals have shown we have a devastating twin axe attack going on!\u201d\nNick Cordle made his official recording debut in the latest ARCH ENEMY video for \u201cUnder Black Flags We March.\u201d Said Michael Amott: \u201d We had a our new guitarist Nick Cordle throw down a little lick on the song and had audio master Andy Sneap remix the song a little\u2026 So, a few minor tweaks here and there to make it something special for this visual\/sonic assault!\u201d\nThe KHAOS continues with more live activities in 2012, leading into a special DVD project to be announced soon.\n\n\nKHAOS LEGIONS tracklist:\nKhaos Overture (intro)\nYesterday Is Dead And Gone\nBloodstained Cross\nUnder Black Flags We March\nNo Gods, No Masters\nCity Of The Dead\nThrough The Eyes Of A Raven\nCruelty Without Beauty\nWe Are A Godless Entity (Instrumental)\nCult Of Chaos\nThorns In My Flesh\nTurn To Dust (Instrumental)\nVengeance Is Mine\nSecrets\nProduced by Rickard Bengtsson and ARCH ENEMY\nMixed and mastered by Andy Sneap\n\nKOVERED IN KHAOS bonus CD tracklist*:\nWarning (Discharge)\nWings Of Tomorrow (Europe)\nThe Oath (Kiss)\nThe Book Of Heavy Metal (Dream Evil)\n*CD2 of the ltd edition and also on the Double LP vinyl\n\nLine-Up:\nAngela Gossow \u2013 vocals\nMichael Amott \u2013 guitars\nChristopher Amott \u2013 guitars (on the album)\nNick Cordle \u2013 guitars (replaced Christopher Amott in early 2012)\nSharlee D\u2019Angelo \u2013 bass\nDaniel Erlandsson \u2013 drums\n\nPhotos by Patric Ullaeus\n\nCover Artwork:\nFront cover by Brent Elliott White\nBooklet layout by Niklas Sundin\n\nDiscography: \nBlack Earth CD\/LP (1996)\nStigmata CD\/LP (1998)\nBurning Bridges CD\/LP (1999)\nWages Of Sin CD\/LP (2002)\nAnthems Of Rebellion CD\/LP (2003)\nDead Eyes See No Future MCD (2004)\nDoomsday Machine CD\/LP (2005)\nLive Apocalypse 2DVD (2006)\nRise Of The Tyrant CD\/LP (2007)\nTyrants Of The Rising Sun \u2013 Live In Japan DVD\/2CD\/2LP (2008)\nThe Root Of All Evil CD\/LP (2009)\nKhaos Legions (2011)\n\nARCH ENEMY online:\nwww.archenemy.net \n\n\n(c) & (p) 2011 Savage Messiah Music.

{"about":"Aerosmith - Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton, Brad Whitford and Joey Kramer - are America's Greatest Rock N' Roll Band with over 150 million records sold worldwide","affiliation":"Aerosmith","band_members":"Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton, Brad Whitford and Joey Kramer","bio":"AEROSMITH \u2013 ROCKS ON\n\nLegends. Icons. Idols. These are the words used to describe those rare bands that have been adored for a lifetime and immortalized as distinct creators of rock and roll. But what these reverent words are missing is the notion of now. How do you reconcile a generation-spanning word like icon with the quick beat of the present? Aerosmith does it. The band members are legends, icons and idols, dynamic in the present; as cool and innovative now as they were thirty years ago. They are a phenomenon, a force of nature, trail-blazing, unstoppable, showing no signs of slowing down.Unique even among the select handful of rock bands who are still active after their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Aerosmith has sold over 100 million albums.\n\nThink for a second about how big a number that is and how many people have heard their music. Huge! Steven Tyler on vocals, Joe Perry and Brad Whitford on guitars, Tom Hamilton on bass, and Joey Kramer on drums. They\u2019ve outdone the trends and fads of rock and roll to become one of the most powerful and electrifying forces in popular music.\n\nRewind for a minute to the early \u201870s, when the phrase \u201csex, drugs and rock & roll\u201d was a rebellious teenager. Enter Aerosmith with a sexy swagger and thrusts ofmetal, glam and boogie woogie. Tyler\u2019s lyrics laced with double entendres and witty humor perfectly complimented by the entire group cool urban charisma. Beyond driving rock and roll tunes, Aerosmith created quintessential power ballads such as Dream On. This dual skill set gave the band a string of gold and platinum albums, including Get Your Wings, Toys in the Attic and Rocks.\n\nThe early \u201880s were rockier times, with Perry and Whitford temporarily leaving the Aero fold to pursue solo projects. The guitarists returned in 1984 and soon after, Aerosmith was back in the saddle again. And they have been on top of the charts ever since. Albums like Permanent Vacation, Pump, Get a Grip and Nine Lives, Just Push Play, and their latest release, the blues-inspired 'Honkin' on Bobo', have all been huge successes. And the killer videos \u2013 a driving force of the video medium, these Boston rockers led the look, style and attitude of the \u201880s MTV generation. Videos for Dude Looks Like a Lady, Livin\u2019 On the Edge and Crazy (starring Liv) are solid MTV classics. And later, with videos like Pink and Jaded, Aerosmith continued to cut the edge.\n\nAlways a step ahead of the pack, Aerosmith\u2019s Just Push Play is the first album to be produced by band members Steven Tyler and Joe Perry (along with Mark Hudson and Marti Frederiksen). The unforgettable pop melodies and bone-shaking rock riffs that are Just Push Play sent Aerosmith even further on their path to musical immortality.\n\n'Honkin' on Bobo' was released in March 2004, and as one Rolling Stone review put it: \"Aerosmith don't have much time for pain on Honkin' on Bobo. The songs are mostly about gettin' some, then gettin' outta there -- Dixon's \"I'm Ready,\" Bo Diddley's \"Road Runner\" -- and the attack is heavy Sixties shindig: snarling guitars, thunderclap drumming, Steven Tyler's 3-D snake hiss and widescreen yowl. Bobo is really a combined tribute: to the originators of the blues' core repertoire and the explosive, electric inventions of 1960s British bands such as the Yardbirds, Mayall's Bluesbreakers and the Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac.\" (David Fricke, Rolling Stone)\n\nWith such an unstoppable passion for creating great music, a unique creative vision and an unyielding appreciation for their fans, there are no limits to what the future holds for Aerosmith.\n","category":"Musician\/band","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Boston","state":"MA","country":"United States","zip":""},"personal_interests":"\n\n","record_label":"Sony","talking_about_count":75265,"username":"aerosmith","website":"www.aerosmith.com\nwww.aeroforceone.com\nwww.twitter.com\/aerosmith","were_here_count":0,"id":"58153618123","name":"Aerosmith","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/aerosmith","likes":13058721,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150656506233124","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/305909_10150656506233124_932482965_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Originally named Inearthed (with a series of demos to their name), COB can be as downright brutal as any metal band when the situation demands.

{"about":"Download \"Stay The Night\" feat. Hayley Williams of Paramore on iTunes: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/StayTheNightiTunes","band_members":"Anton Zaslavski","bio":"Zedd started with music in his daily routine from early childhood on. Born Anton Zaslavski, Zedd was raised in Kaiserslautern, Germany by two classically trained musicians, he began playing the piano at the age of four and built up his knowledge of the Classical repertoire throughout his childhood, at times writing a song a day. At age twelve, Anton learned to play the drums and, soon after he began performing with the post-hardcore\/metal trio Dioramic. As a preteen he was already composing and producing numerous rock songs in his band's own studio. As the aughts progressed, Anton\u2019s awareness of other genres widened, and in 2009 his interest in producing electronic music was piqued after hearing the French electronic duo Justice. With his gift for musicality and background in instrumentation, composition and production, the move into the realm of electronic dance music was seamless.\n\n2009 proved to be a watershed year for Zedd. It was during this year that he began producing electronic music, and within an incredibly short period of time amassed widespread critical and audience acclaim. Within a few months of beginning his production work, Zedd won two Beatport remix contests, the \"Armand Van Helden \/ Strictly Rhythm Remix Contest\" and the \"Fatboy Slim \/ Skint Remix Contest\". These critical wins gave the budding artists the notoriety and clout to catch the interest of Skrillex who essentially found him on the net and signed him to his new OWSLA label. He caught the ear of Interscope A&R Dave Rene and Interscope Geffen A&M Chairman Jimmy Iovine and successfully released several official remixes for powerhouse artists such as Lady Gaga, Black Eyed Peas, P. Diddy, Swedish House Mafia and Skrillex on labels including mau5trap, Interscope, and EMI.\n\nIn the realm of his original compositions, Zedd\u2019s hit singles 'Shave It' and 'Slam The Door' (out through OWLSA) both held the top spot on Beatport's charts for multiple weeks at a time. In the same year, his remix of Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cMarry the Night\u201d appeared on the deluxe edition of the superstar\u2019s latest album Born This Way and his remix of \u201cBorn This Way\u201d appeared on Born This Way: The Remix. In addition to his own compositions and reworkings of others\u2019 songs, Zedd has had other electro heavyweights take their turn at his tracks, including Armin Van Buuren, Kaskade, Knife Party and more.\n\nZedd\u2019s stellar development is undoubtedly linked to his unique and highly recognizable style of composition. It stands out in a crowded field as meticulously detailed and carefully produced, very playful and at the same time remarkably catchy despite the complex musicality drafting it up. Drawing from his diverse musical background spanning from classical to post-hardcore\/metal to electro house Zedd\u2019s music not only draws from uncommon sources but also has the ability to appeal to an audience outside the realm EDM.\n\nZedd signed with Interscope records in 2012 and released his debut LP Clarityin October to much critical acclaim. The album\u2019s first single, \u201cSpectrum,\u201d featuring singer\/songwriter Matthew Koma, garnered massive global attention climbing into the the Top 10 on the iTunes dance chart and holding on to the #1 spot on Beatport Worldwide for almost three weeks. The track then soared to #1 on the Billboard Dance Club Song chart and was ultimately named their Dance Club Song of the year as well as iTunes \u201cBreakthrough Album of the Year (Dance) for 2012.\n\nIn addition to racking up original production credits for artists including Eva Simons\u2019 \u201cI Don\u2019t Like You\u201d and Justin Bieber\u2019s \u201cBeauty And A Beat,\u201d Rolling Stone named Zedd an \u201cArtist to Watch\u201d for 2012, and more recently, MTV deemed him an \u201cArtist to Watch\u201d for 2013. Zedd has performed at major festivals, including Ultra, Electric Daisy Carnival, and Nocturnal and in 2012, he performed at Coachella, Lollapalooza, Hard Summer in Los Angeles, and Electric Zoo in New York. Zedd made his national television debut on The Late Show with David Letterman in October where he turned his signature style upside down performing a stripped down version of his new single \u201cClarity\u201d -showcasing his classical training by playing piano alongside a string quartet and vox from Foxes. The performance is a prime example of Zedd's true musicianship beyond the realm of EDM. Zedd was also chosen to be the only opening act for the Asian leg of Lady Gaga's world stadium-tour \"The Born This Was Ball\u201d.\n\nA musical prodigy from the start, Zedd is already a powerhouse beyond the EDM realm. His originality and momentum will unquestionably propel him into the ranks of superstars.","booking_agent":"North & South America\/Asia\/Australia\/Rest of World - LEE ANDERSON (AM ONLY) - Lee\u0040amonly.com,   Europe - SIMON CLARKSON (WME) - SMC\u0040wmeentertainment.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Kaiserslautern","general_manager":"TIM SMITH (Blood Company) - Tsmith\u0040bloodcompany.net & DAVE RENE - Dave.Rene\u0040umusic.com","genre":"Electro House","hometown":"Kaiserslautern","influences":"Soundcloud.com\/Zedd  \nTwitter.com\/Zedd \nInstagram: \u0040Zeggno\nYouTube.com\/Zedd\n","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Kathryn\u0040biz3.net, Clayton\u0040biz3.net","record_label":"Interscope","talking_about_count":113548,"username":"Zedd","website":"www.soundcloud.com\/zedd www.twitter.com\/zedd","were_here_count":0,"id":"107281645968137","name":"Zedd","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Zedd","likes":1690186,"cover":{"cover_id":722505807779048,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1451943_722505807779048_839987158_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":50}}

{"about":"Steve Vai's highly anticipated, new full-length solo album release \"The Story of Light\" is now available at http:\/\/www.smarturl.it\/thestoryoflight","bio":"While many musicians fit easily into a single category, Steve Vai's unique musical vision remains unclassifiable. After more than 20 years, Vai continues to use unbridled guitar virtuosity and soulful artistry to explore the spectrum of human emotion.\n\nFrom his self-released solo debut \"Flex-Able\" (1984) to his most recent certified Gold and Platinum DVD performance \"Where The Wild Things Are\" (2009), Vai creates a sound all his own by striking a balance between technical ability and poetic phrasing. \"I make music to push my own buttons,\" explains Vai. \"I've always been driven by an addiction to create sounds that are unique \u2013 not better than what other people do, just different.\"\n\nThat obsession with running down the voodoo in his head remains the guiding force behind Vai's ongoing musical evolution and what he loves most about being a musician. \"For me, the real gravy is when I hear a strange or beautiful sound in my head and then make it real in the world using the devices I have as a musician,\" says Vai. \"The things that have never been done before are what interest me most.\"\n\nHis desire to break new ground led Vai to a special performance with the 100-piece Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra this summer in Japan. Together they performed a concerto for electric guitar called \"Fire Strings\" composed by distinguished Japanese composer and concert pianist Ichiro Nodaira. Learning the 20 minutes of raging, atonal electric guitar was the most demanding challenge of Vai's career. \"It's almost impossible to play, and that's why I did it,\" says Vai. \"I think a few other guitar players could play it, but I don't know any who would because of the tremendous time and dedication the music required. It was certainly an honor to be a part of it.\"\n\n\nFANTASY & REALITY\n\nGrowing up on Led Zeppelin and progressive rock, Vai has always had a penchant for the conceptual side of rock. While many of his albums revolve around a specific thematic axis, Vai considers \"Alive in an Ultra World\" (2001, Epic) the high point of his conceptual efforts.\n\nA contender for one of the most ambitious live albums ever recorded, Vai wrote, rehearsed and recorded the music for the two-disc set during a 32-country world tour. Each song is dedicated to a different country \u2013 Bulgaria, Spain and Romania to name a few \u2013 and reflects the flavor of each country's indigenous music. Creating the album was equally exhausting and rewarding. \"On paper the project looks insurmountable,\" says Vai. \"I wrote songs in the morning, rehearsed the new music at sound check with the band in the afternoon, played a two and a half hour show at night and then download the show from my mobile studio later that night. Somewhere in all that craziness, I found time to immerse myself in music from different countries.\n\n\"It was hell on me and the band making that record, but when I listen to the music now there are no words that can describe the joy I feel for having made that fantasy a reality.\"\n\n\"Alive in an Ultra World\" includes \"Whispering a Prayer (Song for Ireland),\" which earned Vai his sixth Grammy nomination to go along with his 1991 Grammy win for best rock instrumental performance for his version of Frank Zappa's \"Sofa\" on the live Zappa tribute album, \"Zappa's Universe.\" \"Whispering a Prayer is probably the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever played in my life,\" says Vai. \"Every time I play it, I'm overcome by feelings of freedom and happiness.\"\n\nIn contrast, Vai needed 20 years of patience to realize his idea for \"The Seventh Song: Enchanting Guitar Melodies - Archives Vol. 1\" (2000, Epic). The album features the seventh song from every Vai solo album before 2000. \"The seventh song on my records has always been the wistful, screaming guitar ballad. Those songs sounded a bit out of place on the original records, but when I put them all together it creates a beautiful, flowing musical experience.\"\n\nWithout a doubt his biggest achievement in terms of sheer girth is \"The Secret Jewel Box\" (2001-Ongoing, Light Without Heat) \u2013 a 10-CD compilation documenting Vai's career through a mix of rarities, outtakes and oddities. Each disc explores a different facet of Vai's career including his soundtrack contributions, work with Frank Zappa, live and studio recordings with Alcatrazz, Japanese-only releases and an eclectic art piece that includes music interspersed with dialogue.\n\nThe collection of hard-to-find gems and unreleased music is a gold rush for fans. \"The Secret Jewel Box is a way for me to gather in one place a lot of the hard to find things I've done in the past,\" explains Vai. \"I think hardcore fans will really enjoy the CD that features a band I was in before I recorded 'Passion and Warfare' called The Classified. That music truly is the missing link between my first and second albums.\"\n\n\nSUCCESS & INFLUENCE\n\nVai first stepped into the spotlight in 1980 as a guitarist in Frank Zappa's band. But Vai's indelible contribution to music came during his solo career, which includes combined sales of nearly six million albums. His debut - \"Flex-Able\" (1984, self-released) \u2013 set the stage for Vai's most influential and best-selling album \u2013 \"Passion and Warfare\" (1990, Relativity). The album expanded the lexicon of rock guitar and ushered in an era of guitar virtuosos in the early '90s. Ironically, two record labels dropped Vai while he recorded the breakthrough album.\n\n\"I didn't know what people were going to think of that record, I just knew that I had to make it,\" recalls Vai. \"I locked myself in the studio, and the music that had been building up in my imagination for years all came rushing out. Honestly, I thought the record was going to sell about 10 copies. Instead it went gold in a week.\"\n\nDespite the album's unqualified commercial and artistic success, it set Vai up for an inevitable backlash in the mid-'90s. \"Guitar players in the '80s were trying to outplay our influences \u2013 people like Jimmy Page, Brian May and Ritchie Blackmore. Some of us were good at it and some of us were just wankers; I've been accused of being both,\" laughs Vai. \"Eventually, that style of guitar playing hit a wall and that's when grunge took over.\"\n\nAlthough his music was replaced on the charts by the Seattle sound, Vai became a major influence on the post-grunge era. Current guitar idols like James \"Munky\" Shaffer of Korn, Mike Eizinger of Incubus and Tom Morello of Audioslave all cite Vai as a major inspiration.\n\nNot only did Vai's music have a huge on influence contemporary hard rock, so did his guitar. In 1987, Vai helped guitar-maker Ibanez design the JEM, and then in 1989, the Universe 7-String guitar, which provided the low-end rumble many guitarists were craving.\n\nVai continues to work with Ibanez, and literally put himself into a recent collaboration dubbed the JEM VAI2K DNA guitar - a limited-edition release of the JEM. \"Ibanez used my blood \u2013 a lot of my blood \u2013 in the guitar's swirling paint job,\" explains Vai. \"Maybe a hundred years from now, when someone decides to clone me from the blood in the paint, my clone will finally figure out how get his music on the radio.\"\n\nIn addition to his influence on musical inspiration and innovation, Vai began branching out into the business of music last year by launching his own record label \u2013 Favored Nations. The label struck Grammy gold in 2002 for best pop instrumental album for \"No Substitutions\" by Larry Carlton and Steve Lukather.\n\n\nSPIRIT & CHARITY\n\nThroughout his career, Vai's creative impulses have been inspired by a deeply-held spiritual commitment to improving the world through his music and actions. \"The most important thing in my life is trying to achieve some sort of spiritual balance because everything flows from that,\" explains Vai. \"When I'm looking back on my life when I'm 70, I want to be proud of the contributions I've made to society, not just in terms of music, but socially too. That's what drives me these days.\"\n\nOne of Vai's earliest philanthropic endeavors was the Make a Noise Foundation, which he founded with Richard Pike in 1988. The organization continues to provide musical instruments and music education to young musicians who cannot afford them.\n\nTo fund the project, Vai regularly auctions off his music gear. \"I set out to cultivate a rich musical awareness among young people because of the experience I had at the Berklee College of Music,\" explains Vai. \"The best music education I got was at the school's listening library where they had every kind of music available. Being exposed to different kinds of music was a big contributor to my musical awakening. I started Make A Noise, in part, to help others have the same experience I had.\"\n\nHelping young musicians is a cause that hits close to home for Vai, who grew up in Carle Place, New York. When Vai was accepted to Berklee his father sold his life insurance policy to pay for the tuition. Vai graduated from Berklee in 1979 and in 2000 was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the esteemed college. \"I was really lucky to have a family that was supportive of me going off to college to pursue music,\" says Vai. \"My dad especially was there for me\u2014paying for guitar lessons and then driving me there no matter where or when. I owe my family a debt of gratitude for all they did.\"\n\nHis most unlikely charity effort began a few years ago when Vai turned his beekeeping hobby into a way to raise money for Make a Noise. \"I got into beekeeping by chance,\" recalls Vai. \"For some reason, a bunch of bees decided to live in the wall of my neighbor's house. My neighbor wasn't happy, but as a result my wife's garden looked fantastic. When my family moved, I decided to plant fruit trees and found out honeybees were the best way to pollinate them so I got my first swarm. My family harvests the honey each year and we give some of it away at Christmas and auction the rest for charity.\"\n\nPlaying the role of King Bee has become an unexpected source of relaxation for Vai. \"Bees are fascinating creatures and taking care of them can be a Zen like experience if you let it be,\" says Vai. \"It's one of the few times of the day that I really do something that's entirely for me. I can forget about all the contractual obligations and just hang out with the bees.\"\n\nBut it is Vai's work with the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) \u2013 the Grammy organization \u2013 that excites him the most. He served on the board of governors with NARAS for almost three years and was recently promoted to trustee.\n\nThe new position gives Vai an opportunity to expand his charity work and help more people. \"For 25 years, I dedicated all my creativity to finding different ways to get from one note to the next using a whammy bar,\" says Vai. \"Now that I'm working with the academy, I've found a forum where I can channel some of my creativity into finding ways to give back.\"\n\n\nFUTURE & CHANGE\n\nDiscovering new challenges isn't hard for Vai; it's finding the time to do them that is the tricky part. One major aspiration high on his list is to record the quintessential solo guitar record while he still has the dexterity to pull it off. \"I don't feel like I've made a record that expresses my full potential on guitar,\" explains Vai. \"I'm fighting time on this project because I'm getting older and at some point I'm going to hit a wall physically. While I still have the chops to do it, I want to make my definitive guitar statement.\"\n\nPerhaps that album, Vai says, would signal the end to one chapter in his career and the start of a new one. While he has no plans to put down the guitar, Vai would like to pursue his childhood dream of becoming a composer. \"I love the way music looks on paper. It looks like art to me,\" says Vai. \"When I first understood what music was, I wanted to be a composer. I've got stacks and stacks of scores that I've written that have never been recorded or performed. I'm really looking forward to exploring new territory.\"\n\n\nSOLO DISCOGRAPHY\n\nFLEX-ABLE (1984, self-released): I love this record because the music is very Zappa-esque. It also reminds me of when my life was simple and all about music.\n\nPASSION & WARFARE (1990, Relativity Records): Creating this record was a complete liberation for me. It's a reflection of music that was tormenting my psyche for a long time to get out. It was a thrilling vindication to be acknowledged for something I felt so strongly about.\n\nSEX & RELIGION (1993, Relativity Records): This was my attempt to start a band. At the time of the recording, I was doing a great deal of soul-searching and that's why the music is so intensely personal.\n\nALIEN LOVE SECRETS (1995, Relativity Records): After the big productions of my two previous albums, it was a blessed release to make an album that was stripped down to just guitar, bass and drums. It was a pure pleasure making this EP.\n\nFIRE GARDEN (1996, Epic): Maybe my favorite; this record is mature and substantial in terms of musical content. I don't know if one record best represents what I do musically, but this album comes close.\n\nULTRA ZONE (1999, Epic): Elements from all my other records pop up here. It's a return to the innocence of FLEX-ABLE, has the compositional elements of PASSION AND WARFARE and has a lot of substance like FIRE GARDEN.\n\nSEVENTH SONG (2000, Epic): That whole record represents a certain frame of mind as opposed the vast mood swings of my full-on records. Those sweet melodies are a musical representation of my desire to become closer with my own spiritual nature.\n\nALIVE IN AN ULTRA WORLD (2001, Epic): This album holds so many memories, feelings, smells and tastes for me. When I think of recording the other records, I think of four studio walls. When I think of recording this record, I'm standing on a bridge in Paris with my wife; I'm at a truck stop in Poland creating mischief with my band; I'm in my hotel room in Greece looking out at the water and writing a song.","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Instrumental","hometown":"Carle Place, New York","is_published":true,"record_label":"Favored Nations","talking_about_count":23393,"username":"stevevai","website":"www.vai.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"8232689025","name":"Steve Vai","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/stevevai","likes":2037589,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152094362314026","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash4\/s720x720\/1474536_10152094362314026_1444882735_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

H\nBritannia Manticora\n\nMalevolent kings of British metal. Masters of the darkest arts and crafts. Cradle Of Filth have been firmly ensconced at the forefront of the extreme music scene for the last two decades. Ever since they emerged from the lengthening Suffolk shadows in 1991, Dani Filth and his fiendish cohorts have blazed a grotesque trail across the globe, spreading their fetid gospel of obscene theatricality, pitch-black horror and exquisite musical madness, earning themselves a formidable reputation as one of the most important metal bands ever. \n\nAfter unleashing three nefarious demo recordings, Cradle Of Filth began their campaign of dastardly destruction in earnest with the release of 1994\u2019s ferocious debut album The Principle Of Evil Made Flesh, laying down a blackprint for everything that would follow, as Mr. Filth\u2019s unhinged vocal versatility and gloriously twisted literary skills collided with a grandiose barrage of scything riffs, macabre atmospherics and bone-wrenching brutality. Upping the abominable ante for 1996\u2019s Vempire EP and its full-length follow-up, Dusk\u2026And Her Embrace, Cradle Of Filth rapidly established themselves as standard bearers for the UK\u2019s dark metallic underground, consolidating that status with increasingly extravagant and dramatic live shows that put the meagre efforts of their contemporaries to shame. By the time 1998\u2019s grand concept piece Cruelty And The Beast was unveiled, Cradle had already started to prod the mainstream\u2019s vulnerable ribcage with their scathing wit and self-deprecation, making a notorious appearance on BBC2 documentary Living With The Enemy that enabled them to scare the merry hell out of startled viewers across the length and breadth of Britain. After Dani set his stalwart songwriting partnership with guitarist Paul Allender (who had returned for a second tenure with the band), 1999\u2019s From The Cradle To Enslave even managed to scale the battlements of the mainstream pop charts, hastening the band\u2019s growing stature as hated household names and music press anti-heroes.\n\nAs the new millennium dawned, Cradle Of Filth tapped a new vein of rich creativity with their fourth studio album Midian; a dizzying eruption of cinematic grimoire and razor-sharp sonic viscera that paved the way for a steady stream of similarly monstrous releases, including their own horror movie (2000's underground success Cradle Of Fear). With an ever-growing penchant for augmenting their gruesome sound with ornate orchestration and all manner of disparate aural mischief, the band bestrode the decade with supreme confidence. Damnation And A Day, the Grammy-nominated Nymphetamine and Thornography all cast their sickly shadow on an otherwise impoverished music world, and countless world tours and festival triumphs duly followed on the whims of major label status.\n\nClicking into a higher and more hideous gear, Cradle displayed their contempt for taking the easy route with 2008\u2019s Godspeed On The Devil\u2019s Thunder, another labyrinthine concept work that told the vile saga of legendary knight and serial killer Gilles de Rais via some of the band\u2019s most aggressive and intense material to date. Sustaining that sickening momentum with 2010\u2019s similarly brutish and melodramatic Darkly Darkly Venus Aversa, our beloved filthmongers have showed no signs of slowing the pace of their creative flow, and have entered the second decade of this new century in the rudest and most rampant of health. \n\nAnd now, it is time for the well-oiled gates of Midian to swing violently open once more as Cradle Of Filth prepare to release their tenth studio album, the all-powerful and undeniably terrifying The Manticore And Other Horrors. Recorded in eight to ten weeks at Springvale and Grindstone studios (where revered engineer Scott Atkins weaves his monstrous gloss), the new album comprises a collection of chilling tales of \u201cpersonal demons, Chimeras, literary fiends and world-enslaving entities\u2026\u201d while showcasing the ongoing redefining and remorseless mutation of the classic Cradle sound, with an ever-more vicious underbelly of punk-fuelled black metal carnage driving the likes of monumental title track Manticore, the obnoxiously infectious For Your Vulgar Delectation and towering slabs of spew-drenched steel like The Abhorrent and Siding With The Titans breathlessly and brutally forward. With tentative plans for a release on Hallowe\u2019en 2012, this is the ultimate Cradle Of Filth experience to date, complete with horrific live show come November and December, the band headline-touring in Europe.\n\n'This is our tenth commandment in metal,\u201d proclaims Dani Filth. \u201cWe have diversified and kept alive the spirit of this band and breathed into it something that, I can proudly say, slays like an absolute motherf**ker. The Manticore is coming\u2026Long live the filth!'","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"At The Gates of Midian","general_manager":"www.inphasemanagement.com","genre":"Metal","hometown":"United Kingdom","is_published":true,"press_contact":"NA: mail\u0040nuclearblastusa.com \/ EU: paul\u0040peaceville.co.uk","record_label":"Nuclear Blast USA \/ Peaceville Records EUROPE","talking_about_count":38891,"username":"cradleoffilth","website":"http:\/\/www.cradleoffilth.com http:\/\/www.theorderofthedragon.com http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cradleoffilth http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/cradleoffilth http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/cradleoffilth http:\/\/www.peaceville.com\/cradleoffilth http:\/\/www.cradleoffilthstore.co.uk\/acatalog\/ http:\/\/jsrdirect.com\/bands\/cof\/ https:\/\/plus.google.com\/112762821742248309154 http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/cradleoffilth","were_here_count":0,"id":"6514209076","name":"Cradle of Filth","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/cradleoffilth","likes":2174678,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151125338704077","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/550220_10151125338704077_1118567670_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"King Animal in stores now: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/KingAnimaliTunes","bio":"\u201cWhen I think of Soundgarden, I think of a sound, I think of one entity, one organic thing,\u201d says singer and guitarist Chris Cornell, \u201cbut I guess that the exciting part is that it\u2019s always been really varied.\u201d\n\nHailed as grunge innovators, Soundgarden redefined rock music for a generation. In the 80s and 90s, the band\u2019s mesmerising soundscapes and compelling lyrics seduced audiences hungry for originality. It was a sound rooted deeply within the wild landscape of the Pacific North West \u2013 an atmosphere which still resonates strongly for Cornell. \u201cThe band is dripping with it\u201d, he says. \u201cthat indescribable longing. It\u2019s not about the society, it\u2019s not about the people, it\u2019s not about the city. It\u2019s some other thing.\u201d\n\nThat elusive \u2018other thing\u2019 pervades Soundgarden\u2019s new album \u2018King Animal\u2019, recorded close to their roots in Seattle and released November 13 2012. Over a year in the making, it promises to continue the musical evolution we anticipate from one of the world\u2019s most groundbreaking bands. One song, the yearning \u2018Taree\u2019, is a hymn to the wilderness \u2013 \u201cmy love song to the natural side of the north west where I grew up,\u201d as Cornell explains. \u201cIt was easy to feel like we were growing up in this strange, mystical place.\u201d By contrast, riotous album opener \u2018Been Away Too Long\u2019 is a doubled-edged blast of homecoming celebration and urban angst.\n\nSoundgarden had been away since 1997, when its four members amicably agreed to put the band to rest while they pursued other projects. But by 2009 they\u2019d decided to work together again. Rehearsals for a world tour swiftly turned into songwriting sessions. \"It isn\u2019t really a matter of reinventing ourselves for a new chapter,\u201d says Cornell. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a bit of natural progression in just living life for 15 years....our lives progressed as they would have done if we\u2019d still been together. We were just catching up.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s unique alchemy reasserted itself and ideas flowed freely, with some songs still under construction while others were already being mixed. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of trust...that things are going to work out, and that songs are going to appear out of nowhere. The first day we started, everybody just would play a part or an idea or a song arrangement that they had, and it started going from there,\u201d recalls Cornell. \u201cWe had a studio engineer recording all our rehearsals and a few songs actually came out of that. The song \u2018Rowing\u2019 - Ben [Shepherd] played this incredible bass ad-lib part and because it was recorded, I went home and looped it and wrote a whole song to it. I\u2019ve learned over the years that following Ben -- or Matt, or Kim \u2013 down these moments of creative brilliance is always a good idea.\u201d\n\n\u2018King Animal\u2019 can be explosive, as in \u2018Blood On The Valley Floor\u2019 (\u201cthe quintessential, perfect, heavy Soundgarden song\u201d), nightmarish (\u2018Worse Dreams\u2019) or wistful (\u2018Halfway There\u2019), leading us through changing sonic landscapes that can embrace both the jazz inflections of \u2018Black Saturday\u2019 and the driving simplicity of feral rocker \u2018Attrition\u2019. The subject matter is broad - Kim Thayil\u2019s lyrics for \u2018Non-State Actor\u2019 are an incisive and cynical take on the powers behind political thrones, while Cornell\u2019s bruised and introspective \u2018Bones of Birds\u2019 explores the terrors and vulnerabilities of parenthood. \u201cHaving children forces you to look past your own mortality,\u201d says Cornell. \u201cHow loss is going to affect them, even long after I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\nSoundgarden remain a truly \u2018alternative\u2019 band in an age when the word has been devalued to just another genre label. Though firmly rooted in their shared sense of place, they continue to be instinctive pathfinders. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had to find a compass and redirect ourselves to the north,\u201d says Cornell. \"That\u2019s never happened to us, and it certainly didn\u2019t happen to us this time.\u201d","category":"Musician\/band","description":"Soundgarden's Official Facebook Page","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","country":"United States","zip":""},"talking_about_count":26432,"username":"Soundgarden","website":"http:\/\/www.soundgardenworld.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"271730225599","name":"Soundgarden","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Soundgarden","likes":1995202,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152015071850600","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1441193_10152015071850600_1132035646_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

The following year, the band won two Grammy Awards for the multi-platinum Rock Steady and performed with U2, Sting and The Rolling Stones.\n\nAfter the double-platinum retrospective Singles Collection, featuring the hit \"It's My Life,\" lead singer Gwen Stefani released two successful solo albums in 2004 and 2006, respectively. In 2009, after a nearly five-year hiatus, No Doubt completed a 50-plus city North American tour performing for more than 750,000 fans that summer.

{"about":"http:\/\/instagram.com\/souljaboy","artists_we_like":"Soulja Boy","band_interests":"Music. Girls. Money. Video Games. Anime.","band_members":"Soulja Boy","bio":"\"Youngest Black Millionaire: Founder of SODMG.com\"\n\n\u201cIn high school, I had this black composition notebook where I used to write down a list of goals: weekly goals, monthly ones, yearly ones, and one for my whole life. In there I had: get a record deal; have a number one song; have a platinum album; get a shoe line and clothing line; invent a dance everyone would do; get my mom out the hood; even little things like get a real watch or do all my homework. One day, I left the notebook in class and this dude found it. He read it out loud in front of everybody when I wasn\u2019t there, trying to embarrass me. Mark my words, a year later, everything in that book had come true. I got the last laugh.\u201d\n\nSoulja Boy Tell\u2019em is many things to many people. Apparently, prophetic is one of them. What began as juddering camcorder footage in his basement mutated into worldwide phenomenon. You\u2019ve memorized the infectious hooks. The dance has been inexorably burned into your muscle memory. And the numbers confirm what you already know: 400 million views on YouTube; over five million downloads of the pandemic single \u201cCrank That (Soulja Boy)\u201d; seven weeks atop Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 singles\u2019 chart; more than five million ringtones sold; platinum status and beyond for debut album Souljaboytellem.com.\n\nThe 1s and 0s are beyond dispute, and frankly out of reach for competitive artists. But what of the Xs and Os of Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em? Can sophomore record iSouljaBoyTellem match his own daunting precedent?\n\n\u201cAs big as rap is, and as big as \u201cCrank That\u201d was, I\u2019m still not as famous as I want to be,\u201d he warns. \u201cI can sit in first class on a plane and a dude next to me in a business suit will wonder who I am. I wanna be Barack Obama big. And not just for a dance I made; I want everybody to know me. So when I\u2019m dead and gone, people can watch my whole life on the internet. I\u2019m thinking about movies, companies, having a building that big [points to a neighboring NYC skyscraper] with Souljaboytellem Inc. on it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m talking about going back to college; I\u2019m smart but I need more knowledge to get there. It\u2019s not impossible.\u201d\n\nSuch proclamations aren\u2019t hype, even hyperbole, but sheer honesty. The gleam in his eye and his steadfast tone confirm. Then a bubbly and bubbling 16-year old, Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em admits he didn\u2019t take the process of his first biography, concocted just before his superstardom, all that seriously. Understandably, he couldn\u2019t have predicted the global groundswell he was about to initiate: \u201cAll this happened off one song, one long run. One year of an adventure. If all that can happen in one year, off one song, from one person, I can do a lot more.\u201d Though Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em\u2019s reign is still in its fledgling stages, his impact is lasting. He\u2019s the classic American success story, a modern-day Horatio Alger tale expressed not in bound book but via video fragments and stadium-shaking refrains.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not like a child star, where people watched you grow up your entire life,\u201d he posits. \u201cI\u2019ve only been in the spotlight for a year and a half or so. Souljaboytellem.com dropped October 2, 2007, and here we are now. But so much has happened in this past year and a half it seems like it\u2019s been a long, long time. People look at me like I\u2019m a marketing genius, and they ask me for advice, but I was just a kid having fun. I can\u2019t tell you how to live life. This isn\u2019t a scheme or a secret I can uncover for you. It just unfolded with my success.\u201d\n\nIn that span of a year, the change is remarkable. Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em is contemplative, careful with his words, wary of tenuous industry alliances, and focused on his next challenges. But he\u2019s not forgotten the people and the sound that have vaulted him to his current perch. Owing everything, he says, to his fans, he rewards them by posting song after song onto YouTube for free consumption. Most notable among these releases is \u201cBird Walk,\u201d his scalding new single. Featuring an accompanying dance, the instructional video to which has likewise been posted to the tune of 500,000 views, \u201cBird Walk\u201d follows quite literally in the footsteps of \u201cCrank That.\u201d Fittingly, Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em now offers the proper cladding for the Bird Walk: his own line of sneakers, courtesy of apparel manufacturer Yums. Fans yearning to walk a day in his shoes have at least the metaphorical opportunity by visiting Finish Line stores or www.yumsshoes.com on November 15th. To stamp the occasion, Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em has recorded the song \u201cWit my Yums On\u201d for inclusion on forthcoming album iSouljaBoyTellem.\n\nElsewhere on the internet, namely on Souljaboytellem.com, expect to see Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em as you\u2019ve never seen him before\u2014drawn. The gifted animation team behind Adult Swim\u2019s \u201cRobot Chicken\u201d has sketched out the Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em cartoon. Combining live action with animation\u2014\u201ca newer, doper version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\u201d\u2014the cartoon is set to premiere in November. Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em and his friends will be drawn, with the rest of the characters human actors. The plotline promises plenty of frivolity: \u201cThe theme of the show is that I\u2019m a big rap star and super celebrity but I still go to public school. So I\u2019m trying to maintain the life of a regular high school student and a rap star at the same time. You might see me and my homeboys as cartoons clowning around in the classroom, and Meagan Goode might be the teacher.\u201d Hmm. Sounds like standing room only in that class. To continue the cartoon theme, Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em is shooting an entirely animated video for the song \u201cSouljaboytellem,\u201d also on iSouljaBoyTellem.\n\nIndeed, music remains Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em\u2019s heart and sole, errr soul. He\u2019s determined to show evolution as an artist and as a man. Lyrically, he tackles issues more substantive to those on the generally juvenile rhetoric on his debut: the success he\u2019s had, the money he\u2019s made, the relationships he\u2019s forged, the beef and hate he\u2019s incurred along the way. The swaggering, smoldering street anthem \u201cTurn my Swag On\u201d addresses some of that negativity. But no boring boast-fest, \u201cTurn my Swag On\u201d is a self-empowerment paean, its video marked by Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em\u2019s irresistible smile. \u201cNew School\u201d and \u201cThe Future\u201d are likewise harder fare, re-affirming SB\u2019s inimitable place among the game\u2019s elite. \u201cThese joints lay the groundwork of what the new school is here to offer, and I\u2019m the first artist from it,\u201d he claims. \u201cI still sit back and think, after everything I\u2019ve done, I\u2019m still not being properly acknowledged for it. It\u2019s not about who\u2019s really doing it; it\u2019s about the friends you got, the connections you make, the money you pay. That\u2019s why I keep it all the way real. You have to maintain your head no matter how much money or success you attain. You do that by standing grounded, by surrounding yourself with people you was around before the deal. One day, I don\u2019t know how or when, the story will be told right.\u201d\n\nHelping to tell the story are \u201cFirst Class\u201d and \u201cEazy,\u201d still more narrative bluster than sophomoric bounce. Second single \u201cYamaha Mama\u201d produced by Polow Da Don and featuring Sean Kingston is a languid libido-fest. And \u201cGucci Bandana\u201d featuring Gucci Mane and Shawty Lo snaps the neck like a chronic syndrome. Aware of his placement in the market, the album version of iSouljaBoyTellem will be released free of profanity. \u201cI approach it like this: you should be able to go into a school and play the entire album over the intercom without the principal having to stop it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy whole creative process is different now,\u201d he continues. \u201cMy beats tend to dictate the way I\u2019m gonna sound. If it\u2019s a Soulja Boy Tell\u2019em beat, it\u2019ll more likely end up as a single, maybe something with a dance to it. But I spit fire on other producers\u2019 beats because it allows me more freedom to go different places lyrically. That variety is the difference between this album and the first album. On the first album, I produced every beat so every song had that commercial, kiddie feel because I was 16. But bringing different producers to the table, I get motivated to rip other people\u2019s joints.\u201d\n\nSoulja Boy Tell\u2019em sounds like a man balancing a healthy respect for the past with an earnest hunger for the future. It\u2019s reflected not merely in his music, but his mentality: \u201cI went back to that same high school class a year later with BET and everybody who was laughing then was asking me for autographs. The girls who dissed me then were crying now. They were acting like I was a whole different person, like we didn\u2019t just go to school together eight months ago. Being on TV had brainwashed everyone I used to know and programmed their minds that I\u2019m this big celebrity that didn\u2019t know anyone anymore. Sometimes I wonder what it feels like to be one of those students in class and to know someone else who\u2019d made it. I\u2019ll never know that feeling.\u201d\n\nSoulja Boy Tell\u2019em is clearly an artist with many levels. That\u2019s why the world should never expect a plateau.

Never before recruiting outsiders, the band enlisted the help of friends to feature 3 guest vocal spots on Hollow Bodies, including Jake Luhrs of August Burns Red, Jesse Barnett of Stick To Your Guns, and electro-rock sensation Lights. The band is currently on the entire Vans Warped Tour for their main stage slot, adding to an already impressive tour resume that includes runs with As I Lay Dying, Avenged Sevenfold, Bullet For My Valentine, and August Burns Red. Throughout the album's 11 charging tracks, Hollow Bodies is blessthefall's reinvigorating approach to an already impressive catalog and career.

They started playing together in Kyle's studio apt on Cochran Ave in Los Angeles. No one could have ever dreamed of where their genius would take them but take them it did...Tenacious D played their first gig at Al's bar in downtown LA in 94; they were armed with only one song at the time. \"Tribute\" a tribute to the greatest song in the world that when once played...

{"about":"HSC 2 OUT NOW -  http:\/\/bit.ly\/itnsdlx http:\/\/twitter.com\/beastieboys","band_members":"Mike D\nAdam \"MCA\" Yauch\nAdam \"Ad-Rock\" Horovitz","bio":"  Who would have thought that a punk band thrown together for its bass player's 17th birthday party would evolve into one of the most influential and groundbreaking successes of its time? Certainly not the then-teenage Beastie Boys, yet the band's 25-year-and-counting career has logged 40 million in sales, two Grammy awards, the MTV Video Vanguard Lifetime Achievement award, four #1 albums--including the first hip hop album ever to top the Billboard 200, the band's\n1986 debut full length, Licensed To Ill, and countless sold out world tours, magazine covers and TV appearances.\n\n  Yet it was in 1981 that Beastie Boys--then consisting of Adam Yauch (a\/k\/a MCA) on bass, drummer Kate Schellenbach (later of Luscious Jackson), guitarist John Berry (of Big Fat Love), and Mike Diamond (a\/k\/a Mike D) on the mic--debuted at Yauch's birthday party. By 1982, the band had played its first public gigs opening for the likes of Bad Brains and Reagan Youth at venues including CBGB, A7, and--by a hair--Max's Kansas City, where they played on the last night of the club's existence.\n\n  Beastie Boys' debut EP, the Pollywog Stew vinyl 7\" was released that year. Recorded at Jerry Williams' 171A, the same place as Bad Brains' \nlegendary ROIR sessions, it is also the first ever release on Dave Parsons' Ratcage Records, a tiny hardcore label operated from an East Village storefront of the same name. The band's first foray into hip hop, the Cooky Puss 12\" (also on Ratcage), followed in 1983, with Young & The Useless guitarist Adam Horovitz (a\/k\/a Adrock) replacing John Berry.  \"Cooky Puss\" would be the first B Boys record to receive play at NYC clubs like Danceteria as the band played its first shows outside the city.\n\n  The Mike D\/MCA\/Adrock Beastie Boys lineup debuted in 1984 with the \"Rock Hard\"\/\"Beastie Groove\" 12.\" Produced by Rick Rubin a\/k\/a DJ Double R, hired by the group as their DJ because he owned a bubble machine, it is the second record to come out on Def Jam. The three hone their skills opening for the likes of Kurtis Blow, spitting rhymes from the DJ booth at the legendary Disco Fever, and even sharing a bill with the Disco Three the night they announce their name change to the Fat Boys.\n\n  The \"She's On It\"\/ \"Slow And Low\" 12\" (the first Def Jam\/Columbia joint release) followed in 1985. Beastie Boys support Madonna on the entire North American \"Virgin Tour.\" Another 12\", \"Hold It Now, Hit It\" makes waves at urban radio as the Boys support Run-DMC, Whodini, LL Cool J and the Timex Social Club on the groundbreaking Raising Hell tour, where many of those listeners learn that Beastie Boys are white (giving rise to the quote \"I never knew you guys were a bunch of Joeys.\"). The \"Paul Revere\" \/ \"The New Style\" 12\" hit not long after.\n\n  Licensed To Ill dropped in fall 1986 and became the first Beastie Boys album--and the first Rap album ever--to go #1. Fueled by \"Fight For Your Right,\" \"No Sleep Til Brooklyn,\" \"Brass Monkey\" and \"Posse In Effect,\" it remained at #1 for seven weeks and simultaneously reached #2 on the urban chart, becoming the fastest selling debut to date for Columbia and the first hip hop record to break 5 million.\n\n  1989's Paul's Boutique saw Beastie Boys resurface with a new deal (Capitol), a new home (Los Angeles) and a new array of styles.\nProduced by Beastie Boys and the Dust Brothers, Paul's Boutique laid down the blueprint for a generation of emergent genres and went over the collective head of a nation. The likes of \"Shake Your Rump,\" \"Lookin' Down The Barrel Of A Gun,\" \"Car Thief,\" Shadrach,\" and the hip hop \"suite\" \"B-Boy Bouillabaisse\" contained lyrical and musical references too plentiful and diverse for the average mind to compute in one sitting. Nevertheless, Paul's Boutique elevates Beastie Boys to a new level of critical respect: thumbs up from Robert Christgau, four stars from Rolling Stone, and the classic quote hailing it as the \"Pet Sounds or Dark Side Of The Moon of Hip Hop\" depending on which magazine you're reading.\n\n  Check Your Head (Grand Royal \/ Capitol), released in 1992, heralded the return of live instrumentation into the B Boys mix. With Mike D on drums, Yauch on bass and Adrock on guitar, Check Your Head's creation would commence in Adam Horovitz's Hollywood apartment before being temporarily aborted following repeated threats from a downstairs neighbor.  The band then relocated to its own G-Son studios (with the parquet floor) in Atwater Village, CA.  Produced by the band and Mario Caldato Jr. (who first worked with B Boys as engineer on Paul's Boutique), Check Your Head would yield a watershed of new B Boys staples, including \"So Whatcha' Want,\" \"Pass The Mic,\" \"Gratitude\" and \"Jimmy James.\"  With the assistance of Keyboard Money Mark and assorted percussionists, Beastie Boys returned to the touring circuit and Check Your Head hit double platinum.\n\n  By 1993, the G-Son complex constructed for the recording of Check Your Head had expanded to house the band's record company, Grand Royal. The label's first independent release, Luscious Jackson's In Search Of Manny, and the first issue of Grand Royal magazine debuted that same year.  Originally conceived as a newsletter to answer fan correspondence, the magazine soon took on a life of its own. \nCo-edited by Beastie Boys and friends, the Fall\/Winter 1993 debut issue featured a Bruce Lee cover story, original artwork by George Clinton, interviews with Q-Tip, Coxsone Dodd, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and more. Subsequent cover subjects include Lee \"Scratch\" Perry, the history of the Moog synthesizer, and Miami Bass.\n\n  In the summer of 1994, Ill Communication (Grand Royal\/Capitol), also produced by the band and Mario Caldato Jr., entered the charts #1 as the band was out slaying 'em nationwide on Lollapalooza. The album's first video, \"Sabotage,\" directed by Spike Jonze, inadvertently gave rise to international scandal when top honors at the year's MTV Video Music Awards went to R.E.M.'s \"Everybody Hurts\" and Yauch's intoxicated uncle, Nathanial Hornblower, stormed the Radio City Music Hall stage in protest.  A drained wineskin was later discovered on the premises.\n\n  Royalties from two songs on Ill Communication --\"Shambala\" and \"Bodhisattva Vow\"--were donated to found the Milarepa Fund, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting awareness and activism regarding the injustices perpetrated on native Tibetans by Chinese occupational government and military forces.  In May 1994, Beastie Boys played three shows--one each in New York, Los Angeles and Washington DC--donating proceeds to Milarepa. These shows would pave the way for the Tibetan Freedom Concert series, which would stage some of the most significant benefit shows of the decade.\n\n  Ill Communication was supported by Beastie Boys' first arena headline tour since the '80s: The Quadraphonic Joystick Action arena tour, which sold out NYC's Madison Square Garden and Chicago's Rosemont Horizon in half an hour each, Massachusetts' Worcester Centrum in approximately 20 minutes, and Detroit's Cobo Arena in nine.  One dollar from each ticket sold on the tour was donated through Milarepa to local charities in each city on the tour.  The band continued to expand its touring universe with treks through South America and Southeast Asia. Following the tour's conclusion, Beastie Boys recorded and released Aglio e Olio through the independent Grand Royal pipeline. Consisting of eight songs clocking in at 11 minutes, the EP recalls the vintage hardcore punk of the band's infancy. Aglio's release is commemorated by a handful of unannounced club gigs over the following months.\n\n  The first Tibetan Freedom Concert took place June 15 and 16, 1996 at the Polo Fields in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.  100,000 people attend the weekend event, making it the single biggest benefit concert on U.S. soil since 1985's Live Aid.  Joining Beastie Boys for the historic weekend: A Tribe Called Quest, Beck, Bjork, Cibo Matto, De La Soul, Foo Fighters, Fugees, John Lee Hooker, Pavement, Rage Against The Machine, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Smashing Pumpkins, Sonic Youth, Yoko Ono and Ima, Buddy Guy, Biz Markie, Skatalites, Richie Havens, Chaksam-Pa, and guest speakers Tibet House founder Robert Thurman and Palden Gyatso, a Tibetan monk who endured 33 years of torture and imprisonment for nonviolent protest.\n\n  The same year, The In Sound From Way Out!, originally serviced as an extremely limited promotional compilation of Beastie Boys instrumental cuts, was made commercially available through Grand Royal\/Capitol due to popular demand.\n\n  A second two-day Tibetan Freedom Concert took place June 7 and 8,\n1997 at New York's Randall's Island, featuring Beastie Boys, U2, Radiohead, Foo Fighters, Rancid, KRS-One, the Patti Smith Group, Alanis Morissette and a host of others, and was documented on a three-CD Tibetan Freedom Concert collection released that fall. Having moved back to NYC, Beastie Boys spent the remainder of the year working on their studio tan.\n\n  One year later, tickets to the third Tibetan Freedom Concert would sell out within one afternoon.  Over 130,000 attend the event over the course of June 13 & 14, 1998 at Washington DC's RFK Stadium. On thebill are Beastie Boys, Radiohead, Dave Matthews Band, Pearl Jam, R.E.M, Herbie Hancock's Headhunters, Sonic Youth, Luscious Jackson and a surprise finale' by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, among others.\n\n  Barely a month later, Hello Nasty was released (July 14, 1998) on Grand Royal\/Capitol. Spurred by the monster (no pun intended, well,\nmaybe) success of the \"Intergalactic\" single and video, the record clocked first week sales of nearly 700,000 in the U.S. and went straight in at #1 in England, Germany, Australia, Holland, New Zealand and Sweden, #2 in Canada and Japan, and Top 10 in Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Belgium, Finland, France and Israel. Sick! That same month, the 360-degree In The Round tour would be unveiled July 31 at Seattle's Key Arena.  The tour's turntable stage set put every attendee in the official \"Beastie Boys Winners Circle,\" offering unobstructed sightlines from every seat in the house, while a specially designed circular P.A. gave new dimension to the term \"Surround Sound.\"\n\n  Early in the tour, Beastie Boys made live tracks available for free download to fans unable to attend the shows-and were blindsided by their label pulling the tracks down. The struggle to keep the tracks up on BeastieBoys.com was documented in a Wall Street Journal cover story-which featured one of those cool little stipple drawings of Mike D. The rest of the group was insanely jealous and vowed one day to have their own little drawings as well.\n\n  Having closed 1998 by accepting the Video Vanguard lifetime achievement honor at the MTV Video Music Awards, Beastie Boys rang in\n1999 with Artist, Band and\/or Record of the Year accolades from the likes of Rolling Stone, SPIN, The New Yorker and Playboy, among others. A month later, at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, the now quadruple-platinum Hello Nasty took Best Alternative Music Performance, while \"Intergalactic,\" nailed Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group--the first time an artist has ever won in both Rap and Alternative categories.\n\n  The fourth Tibetan Freedom Concert was the series' most ambitious undertaking to date.  Over the course of the June 13, 1999 weekend, a lineup of multinational talent played continuously in East Troy WI, Amsterdam, Tokyo and Sydney, including Beastie Boys, Radiohead's Thom Yorke, Joe Strummer, Blondie, Run DMC, Luscious Jackson, and the Cult among others.\n\n  1999 would also see \"Intergalactic\" take Best Hip Hop Video honors at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, Beastie Boys and Elvis Costello \"re-enact\" Elvis' classic U.S TV debut for Saturday Night Live's 25th Anniversary extravaganza, backing him on \"Radio Radio,\" and the release of The Sounds Of Science 2-CD anthology.\n\n  In 2000, longtime Beastie Boys visual collaborator Nathanial Hornblower compiled 18 of the band's videos for an addition to the Criterion Collection's portfolio of acclaimed and influential cinema. \nThe 2-disc Beastie Boys DVD Anthology featured alternate audio remixes and alternate camera angles, making for an nfinite number of audio\/video permutations. STEREO MAN magazine lauded the Anthology \"the benchmark by which all other music DVDs will now be judged.\" The set included Hornblower's own \"Alive,\" \"Body Movin',\" \"Intergalactic,\" \"So Whatcha Want,\" \"Pass The Mic,\" \"Shadrach\" and \"Shake Your Rump,\" as well as candid insights into the bizarre and lonely world of estranged Criterion producer Ralph Spaulding.\n\n  In the wake of September 11, 2001 the Milarepa-organized, Beastie Boys-headlined NEW YORKERS AGAINST VIOLENCE benefit was staged October 28 & 29 at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom, generating net proceeds in excess of $125,000 disbursed to the New York Women's Foundation Disaster Relief Fund and the New York Association for New Americans (NYANA) September 11th Fund for New Americans--organizations chosen for their efforts on behalf of those affected by the September 11th attacks least likely to receive help from other sources. The NYAV line-up included the Strokes, the B-52's, Cibo Matto, Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Mos Def, N*E*R*D, Rival Schools, the Roots, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Saul Williams, Stretch Armstrong, Afrika Bambaata, and a surprise two-song set by Moby and Michael Stipe (featuring an impromptu cameo by Bono). Speakers at the event included Yoko Ono, Ibrahim Ramey of the Muslim Peace Fellowship, Benjamin Barber of Democracy Collaborative, Yanki Tshering of NYANA, Miriam Buhl of the NYWF, while surprise intros came from Jimmy Fallon, Sean Lennon, and others.\n\n  Not long after, Beastie Boys completed construction on a recording studio in downtown Manhattan-Oscilloscope Laboratories (with the plywood floor)-and began recording new music. In March 2003, Beastie Boys added their voice to the growing protest against the U.S. war on Iraq. Not willing to wait until their album is finished to comment on the America's imminent course toward war, they offer the new track \"In A World Gone Mad\" as a free download on Beastieboys.com, moveon.org, winwithoutwarUS.org, MTV.com, and milarepa.org. That same year would see the organization of the 9th and10th Tibetan Freedom Concerts, which Beastie Boys played April 19th at Tokyo's NK Hall and April 20th at Taipei's Stadium of Song-Hsan District in Taiwan-the band's first-ever Taipei appearance. En route home, B Boys headlined the Coachella festival in Indio CA, moving tens of thousands with an all hip hop set of classics, peppered by the debut of a few new numbers.\n\n  Beastie Boys' sixth studio album, To The 5 Boroughs, released in summer 2004, was the band's third consecutive #1 debut-and Rolling Stone magazine's only 5-star review of the year. A minor scandal would ensue when The New York Times ran an unsolicited review of Nathanial Hornblower's video for the record's #1 single \"Ch-Check It Out,\" rubbing the award-winning auteur the wrong way. The Times ultimately ran Hornblower's rebuttal, in which he declared his technique \"clearly too advanced for (the Times') small way of looking at it\" and demanded that the paper reimburse him for a dead goat.\n\n  To The 5 Boroughs was supported by the Challah At Your Boy world tour-or as the band corrected the media, traveling pageant--supported by Talib Kweli and Bob Moore's Amazing Mongrels (yes, a live dog show, hence the pageant appellation).\n\n  Tour, pageant, call it what you will.  It climaxed with a sold-out October 9 homecoming at Madison Square Garden, prior to which Beastie Boys distributed 50 cameras to audience members, who were charged with capturing the experience of a live musical performance like no film ever before. Their efforts (and herculean editing sessions) spawn the feature-length AWESOME; I FUCKIN' SHOT THAT!, which debuted at Sundance in early 2006 and was released theatrically the same year.\n\n  Dateline: June 26, 2007 a\/k\/a present. Scratch that: the future!\n\n  With the release of the all-instrumental The Mix-Up, Beastie Boys throw listeners a curveball reminder of the one constant throughout the band's 25-year-and-counting career: reinvention. The Mix-Up features Diamond, Horovitz and Yauch back on drums, guitar and bass, with able assistance from Keyboard Money Mark and longtime percussionist Alfredo Ortiz, as they hit the restart button once again for another career landmark: Beastie Boys' first ever full length offering of all-new, all-original instrumental recordings. \n\n  Sure to please fans of the instrumental cuts from Check Your Head and Ill Communication compiled for the cult hit The In Sound From Way Out!, The Mix-Up finds NYC's favorite sons drawing on one of their arsenal's primary strengths and pushing it into bold new directions as they prepare and contemplate their next move.\n\n","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"New York, NY","influences":"Hip-Hop, Punk Rock, Instrumental","is_published":true,"record_label":"Capitol Records","talking_about_count":9158,"username":"beastieboys","website":"http:\/\/beastieboys.com\nhttp:\/\/twitter.com\/beastieboys\nwww.myspace.com\/beastieboys\n","were_here_count":0,"id":"18279403944","name":"Beastie Boys","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/beastieboys","likes":3017489,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150683632218945","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/432068_10150683632218945_1625120432_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Thanks for liking my new artist page, here is a little bit about me:\n \nMy music is mostly influenced by acoustic, folk, rock and all other kinds of music. I also really like adding on elements of gospel and soul.  I tend to write and sing about love, demons I have faced, and different times in my life that have brought me down, picked me up and made me who I am today.\nSince 2008 I have released 3 albums, 2 full length studio albums with STOMP RECORDS (can) \/ WOLVERINE RECORDS (eu) , and one live self-release on 2 SONG RECORDS (that's my own record label that I just started in Canada)\n\nI like to tell my stories in their rawest form.  Through my music, I hold nothing back.  \n \nConstantly showcasing different side-kick musicians for my live shows and recordings, you never know who I will show up and play with.  It is a rotating table of talented people by my side all the time.  I have travelled the world touring with my music solo and with bands.   I have been to 25 Countries and seen more of this world than I ever thought I would.  I work hard tho!  I keep myself motivated and inspired and am constantly finding new ways to create and accomplish stuff.\n\nIn my home time I work with various artists on various projects.

{"about":"Dutch DJ, producer, labelowner and music addict! The WKND starts here!","band_members":"Ferry Corsten","bio":"Producer. DJ. Pioneer. Innovator. Visionary. He\u2019s the man that singlehandedly initiated a revolution in a dance musicgenre -one that\u2019s long since touched everycorner of the globe. Having designed the Dutch trance sound, he propelled it into the clubbing consciousness and on further still into popular culture. From there he continues to innovate at every turn, working with vocalists as diverse as SimonLe Bon and Guru and has remixed music from some of the planet\u2019s most enduring artists - U2, The Killers, Faithless, Moby and William Orbit among them. For 20 years he\u2019s foreseen what club citizens want to dance to and as an artisan DJ\/producer, delivered it. He\u2019s released three artist albums under his own name (with a fourth \u2018WKND\u2019 scheduled for February 2012)and in doing so has captured the hearts and minds of legions of fans and scooped some of the world\u2019s most prestigious music prizes along the way. He\u2019s regularly ranked as one of the top 10DJs in the world, and of late has turned to charitable activities, working with the World Wildlife Fund.Yet through all this he\u2019s still one of the most down-to-earth, two-feet-on-the-floor DJs you\u2019ll find. He\u2019s Ferry Corsten.\n\nHow It All Began: Corsten started his career performing self-composed music live in his native country Holland. His first studio music arrived in 1991 when he produced the embryonic rave track \u2018Spirit of Adventure\u2019. In 1995, under the name Hole In One and aged just 21 years old, he won the prestigious De Grote Prijs van Nederland award, which recognized his outstanding contribution to Holland\u2019s electronic dance music scene.\n\nReinventing Trance: In the early 90s Ferry\u2019s head was turned by the music streaming in from Germany. By 1996, with original trancesound beginning to contract, he set about creating a new, more accessible and ebullient principle for it. With a strong reception to his early tracks(Moonman\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Be Afraid\u2019 and Discodroids \u2018Interspace\u2019 among them), he launched Tsunami Records in \u201897 and a year later, under the alias System F, split the genre\u2019s atom. A veritable EDM milestone, \u2018Out Of The Blue\u2019 formed spear tip of Corsten\u2019s trance sound - one that was quickly galvanized by co-productions like Gouryella\u2019s \u2018Gouryella\u2019(with Ti\u00ebsto) and Veracocha\u2019s \u2018Carte Blanche\u2019. Within 6 short months The Dutch Trance Sound(as it had become known) had seized control of Europe\u2019s dancefloors and national charts. Ferry\u2019sremix of William Orbit\u2019s \u2018Barber's Adagio For Strings\u2019 became a top 5 in the UK, where his achievements were reflected by Muzik Magazine who named him as Producer of the Year at their 1999 Ericsson Muzik awards.\n\nSuperstar Producer Becomes SuperstarDJ: Demand to see the man behind the music had quickly placed Corsten behind turntables. He fast established a reputation for impassioned floor-igniting sets, which engaged and delighted an ever-expanding group of fans. From smashing the earliest trance scene events (inc. Innercity,Trance Energy and Dance Valley), there\u2019s now not a metropolis on Earth that Corsten\u2019s not rocked and re-rocked. He entered DJ Magazine\u2019s Top 100 poll in the first year of voting and, as of 2011 has enjoyed an incredible unbroken 12-year run in the chart.He won Best Trance DJ at both the 2005 and 2007 Ibiza Awards and in the same year was named DJ of the Year by Dutch national radio station Slam!FM.\n\nRight Of Way to L.E.F. In 2002, with the euphoric sound he\u2019d engineered continuing to hold sway over dance airwaves, Corsten refused to play safe. Having changed the face of trance once,he ripped up his own rulebook and set out to do it again. Evolving it at speed, 2002 saw the release of \u2018Punk\u2019 and the following year \u2018Rock Your Body, Rock\u2019 (tracks which for the first time spliced an electro gene intotrance). Both exploded, with the latter hitting #11 in the UK national chart and were featured on his 2004 debutalbum, \u2018Right Of Way\u2019. That was followed by \u2018L.E.F.\u2019 in 2006 and (delivering on its \u2018Loud Electronic Ferocious\u2019 mandate) it saw Ferry begin to integrate some of his own earliest musical influences back into his music. Released on his new Flashover label, Corsten drafted 80s legends like Simon Le Bon, Howard Jones and Gangstarr founder, Guru into collaborate on the album, balancing them with trancier material like \u2018Galaxia\u2019 and floor-smash \u2018Beautiful\u2019.\n\nCorsten\u2019s Countdown: Midway through 2007 Ferry launched Corsten\u2019s Countdown, his radio show platform. Each week, for the last five years, listeners have ranked the 10 tracks Ferry plays via the show\u2019s website and his Facebook Fan Page. This in turn has created the most interactive radio show in the world, with its listeners determining a chart of the show\u2019s music. To celebrate its 150th episode Ferry introduced the world to the Cue Play App, a mobile digital DJ application, which was pre-loaded with tracks from his Flashover label. Corsten\u2019s Countdown is now aired in over 50 countries.\n\nFlashover Recordings and Premier Recordings: In 2005, after 8 years at the helm, Ferry left Tsunami Recordings to launch a new label enterprise, Flashover Recordings. In addition to becoming his new musical base, it\u2019s fostered new talent, signing the likes of Rafa\u00ebl Frost, Arty, Tritonal, Yuri Kane and many more to its roster. Its releases proved such a hit with fans that it quickly spun off the imprints Flashover Progressive, Flashover Tech, Levare Recordings, Flashover Chill Out and Flashback (which houses Ferry's complete backcatalogue and also includes previously unreleased material). Expanding his label portfolio further, he launched Premier, a joint-venture label with Black Hole Recordings in 2010. Established as a platform for crossover dance music, Premier has subsequently released music from artists including Betsie Larkin, Chris Lake, Robbie Rivera, Radio Killer and Kris Menace.\n\nFull On Ferry: Embarking ona new show concept In October of 2007, Full On Ferry saw him lynchpin the arena-sized events, handpicking other DJs for unique back-to-back sets. Notably, at the first two events, Ferry wowed the audience in his home city of Rotterdam by DJing whilst suspended above the crowd in a \u2018floating\u2019 booth. Full On Ferry: Ibiza saw him embark on a season-long White Isle takeover at the newly opened Sankeys club in 2011. The end of that year saw him bring the show to Brixton\u2019s O2 Academy in London on New Years Eve for the first UK edition of the event. Various Full on Ferry events have already been scheduled for 2012.\n\nOnce Upon A Night \/ Twice In A Blue Moon: Ferry\u2019s 3rd album under his own name was heralded by the single \u2018Radio Crash\u2019 and was unveiled to fans at 2008\u2019s Full On Ferry event at the Ahoy in Rotterdam. \u2018Twice In A Blue Moon\u2019 carried the club hits \u2018We Belong\u2019, the Betsie Larkin-sung \u2018Made of Love\u2019 and in typical fashion more experimental material like the techno-edged \u2018Brain Box\u2019. It was released in the same year as Corsten\u2019s first child was born and the title (and certain tracks, including \u2018Gabriella\u2019s Sky\u2019) were inspired by events in Ferry\u2019s life at the time. T.I.A.B.M.went on to spawn a major 40-date world release tour and the following year a remix edition and the \u2018Backstage\u2019 DVD.\n\nIt was whilst being interviewed for the \u2018Backstage\u2019 that Ferry announced plans for \u2018Once Upon A Night\u2019. Having enjoyed a long mix-comphistory (one that\u2019s included 6 editions of the mega-selling Trance Nation series and his own Passport albums) Ferry entered a new mix era. Centred on material collated from his Flashover labeland exclusive to the \u2018Once Upon a Night\u2019 albums, in 2010 alone it spawned two volumes and a supporting world tour.\n\nAliases, In-Groups And Co-productions: Having now released tracks under more than 30 different artist names, Corsten has probably made greater use of aliases than any other producer working in the scene. Their impact has been felt far and wide, with some of his best known becoming next to synonymous with his own name. Chief among them have been System F, Moonman, Eon, Albion and Pulp Victim.\n\nCo-producing on tracks like Gouryella\u2019s \u2018Gouryella\u2019 and Veracocha\u2019s \u2018Carte Blanche\u2019 he helped launch the careers of artists like Ti\u00ebsto and Armin van Buuren. It is a studio dynamic he enjoys to this day\u2026 Having previously collaborated with artists as contrasting as Public Enemy and Simon Le Bon, he most recently re-teamed with Armin van Buuren (after System F\u2019s \u2018Exhale\u2019) for the 2011 club smash \u2018Brute\u2019.\n\nThe Here-And-Now: Ferry marked 2 decades of working in electronic dance music in late 2011 with his 20 Years of Ferry Corsten mega-mix album. In releasing it in an App-only format, he became the first electronic dance artist to put out an album solely through this medium. Its multimedia release included 34 of his biggest hits, worked into the mix. On the singles front he released \u2018Check It Out\u2019, \u2018Minack\u2019, \u2018Brute\u2019 (co-produced with Armin) \u2018Feel It\u2019 and \u2018So Good\u2019 - the latter going out as a free-share track, as a \u2018thank you\u2019 in recognition of his fans loyalty. In October of 2011 Corsten joined forces with Olmeca Tequila, whose owners Pernod-Ricard launched a limited edition bottle, which Ferry himself designed. It was also the year that he became an ambassador for the Dutch World Wildlife Fund, where he has begun to leverage the exposure his events afford him to raise awareness for the Fund\u2019s activities.\n\nEarly 2012 will see the release of Ferry\u2019s fourth studio album \u2018WKND\u2019. The album was prefaced in late 2011 by the launch of Ferry\u2019s new YouTube-based WKNDR webisodes, which take fans behind the scenes of his gigs and keeps them up to date with his production work.","booking_agent":"http:\/\/www.twenty4sevenmanagement.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Rotterdam","genre":"trance, electro, house, progressive","hometown":"Rotterdam, The Netherlands","is_published":true,"press_contact":"http:\/\/www.ferrycorsten.com","record_label":"Flashover Recordings","talking_about_count":11794,"username":"FerryCorsten","website":"http:\/\/www.ferrycorsten.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"51647658208","name":"Ferry Corsten","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/FerryCorsten","likes":968798,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152010378898209","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash4\/s720x720\/1460260_10152010378898209_742704682_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"For more news and information check out, www.cannibalcorpse.net and www.myspace.com\/cannibalcorpse\n\nFollow us on Twitter! \u0040corpseofficial","band_members":"Alex Webster - bass\nPaul Mazurkiewicz - drums\nPat O'Brien - guitar\nGeorge \"Corpsegrinder\" Fisher - vocals\nRob Barrett - guitar","bio":"Formed in 1988, Buffalo born\/Tampa raised Cannibal Corpse helped found, manipulate and transcend the very boundaries of death metal beginning with the scandalously controversial debut, Eaten Back To Life. Raising the eyebrows of inquisitive metalheads and incensed parents and politicians, the record - produced by Scott Burns at the now renowned Morrisound Studios - was more extreme and confrontational than anything the metal genre had ever known. As a result of the band's brilliantly gruesome cover art, grisly lyrics and song titles like \"Hammer Smashed Face,\" \"Meat Hook Sodomy\" and \"Addicted To Vaginal Skin,\" follow-up records Butchered At Birth (1991) and Tomb Of The Mutilated (1992) were met with further contempt by the likes of such organized censorship leagues as the PMRC. In just three years, the sale of Cannibal Corpse merchandise was (temporarily) prohibited in Australia, Korea and New Zealand (in fact, the sale of Butchered At Birth and the performance of those three records is still forbidden in Germany). But dissuaded they were not.\n\nProving technical dexterity, diabolic vocal grunts and a penchant for serial killers, zombies and gore of all shapes, sizes and textures, Cannibal Corpse won over the hearts of many a metal extremist and have since become a harrowing household name. Since the bands inception they have sold millions of albums world wide and show no sign of slowing or bowing down to the ever changing metal genre. Massive tours throughout the U.S. and Europe as well as Australia and South America only underscored the band's staying power\u2026and all this with zero commercial radio presence and minimal video play (although the band did appear in the Hollywood blockbuster, Ace Ventura - Pet Detective).\n\nThe momentum continued with the 1996 release of Vile, the first Cannibal record to feature former Monstrosity throat George \"Corpsegrinder\" Fisher following the departure of Chris Barnes. Any skepticism over the new voice behind the mighty Corpse was quickly put to rest. Simply put, Vile slayed from beginning to end and became the first ever death metal record to enter the prestigious Billboard charts. Over the next few years, relentlessly touring, bolstered musicianship and progressively more potent recordings saw the band increase in popularity within the underground and beyond.\n\nAfter the mass success of 2004's The Wretched Spawn and some personnel changes (longtime guitarist Jack Owen fled the band in 2004 to carry on his commitments with his rock project, Adrift. Origin axe-master Jeremy Turner filled in for the band during their remaining tours that year before Malevolent Creation\/Hate Plow\/Solstice guitarist Rob Barrett, who played on Cannibal Corpse's infamous releases The Bleeding and Vile records, rejoined the band as a fulltime member.), Cannibal Corpse has returned to the Death Metal frontlines with the pungently eloquent majesty that is Kill.\n\nSimply titled but meticulously assembled, Kill was recorded with producer Erik Rutan (Hate Eternal\/ex-Morbid Angel) at Mana Studios in St. Petersburg, Florida. The tenth record of their storied career, each track basks in its own claustrophobic abrasiveness and maniacal subject matter. From the onset of the fiery \"The Time To Kill Is Now,\" guitarists Barrett and Pat O'Brien, vocalist George \"Corpsegrinder\" Fisher, bassist Alex Webster and drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz pummel with a renewed sense of urgency. Fast, furious and scrupulously timed, the tune is a palpable reminder that Cannibal remains a force to be reckoned. \"Make Them Suffer\" sears with an old school Possessed vibe (a band to whom Cannibal has paid homage to on several occasions), while \"Necrosadistic Warning,\" replete with a barrage of blistering solo work by O'Brien whose guitar deftness is often underestimated, comes riddled with visions of zombies sexually gratifying themselves with the body parts of the beings they've slain. Other tracks like the telling \"Five Nails Through The Neck,\" \"Death Walking Terror,\" \"Brain Removal Device\" and instrumental closer \"Infinite Misery\" see the five-piece at their most cogent, both lyrically and musically.\n\nOlder, wiser, and as malevolent as ever before, the time to Kill is now!

{"about":" 'Life, Love & Hope', Dec. 3rd N. America & Dec. 6th Eur. Order Amazon: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/BostonLifeLoveHope iTunes http:\/\/smarturl.it\/lifeloveandhope","band_members":"2012\nTom Scholz\nGary Pihl\nTommy DeCarlo\nDavid Victor \nTracy Ferrie\nCurly Smith","bio":"The arena rock group behind one of the fastest-selling debut albums in history, Boston was essentially the vehicle of studio wizard Tom Scholz, born March 10, 1947, in Toledo, OH. A rock fan throughout his teen years, he began writing songs while earning a master's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After graduation, he began work for Polaroid, and set about constructing his own 12-track recording studio in the basement of his home, where demos were recorded that earned Scholz and vocalist Brad Delp a contract with Epic in 1975. Although some recording and overdubs were later done in Los Angeles, the 1976 release of Boston consisted largely of tapes recorded in Scholz's basement. (By then, the lineup had coalesced around Scholz, Delp, guitarist Barry Goudreau, bassist Fran Sheehan, and drummer John \"Sib\" Hashian.) Boston spawned three hit singles (\"More Than a Feeling,\" \"Long Time,\" and \"Peace of Mind\"), and shot immediately to the top of the charts, remaining the best-selling pop debut effort in history before it was supplanted by Whitney Houston's first album in 1986.\n\nDespite the record's overwhelming success, Scholz spent over two years working on the follow-up, 1978's number one hit Don't Look Back; a perfectionist, he only then released the album because of intense label pressure for product. Unsatisfied with the results, he swore to produce the next album at his own pace; as a result, the chart-topping Third Stage did not appear until 1986, at which time only Scholz and Delp remained from the original lineup.\n\nScholz spent the next several years in the courtroom: eventually, he won a seven-year battle against Epic, which claimed Boston had reneged on its contract by taking so long between releases. When the band resurfaced again in 1994 with Walk On, Scholz was the lone remaining member; Delp and Goudreau had reunited in 1992 as RTZ, releasing the album Return to Zero. Unlike previous returns, Walk On was a commercial failure. Radio and MTV ignored any attempts at singles or videos, and the minimalist approach taken by the popular alternative artists of the era made the crystalline production and lengthy recording time seem anachronistic.\n\nTaking another eight years to work on the next record, he targeted the Internet crowd first by releasing a single to \/www.MP3.com in the summer of 2002. The track became the site's number one download, and word of their new album spread quickly. (Delp's return to the group also helped matters.) Secondly, Scholz set his lyrical sights on political targets, going so far as to title the record Corporate America as he emphasized his disdain for the system he had been a vital part of at one time. After releasing the record in the fall of that year, Boston embarked on a tour that took them into 2004. In March of 2007, however, Delp passed away in an incident later ruled suicide.\n\nIn addition to his fame as a musician, Scholz also found success as an inventor and businessman. In 1981, he formed Scholz Research & Design, Inc., a company founded to create high-tech music equipment. After first developing the Power Soak, a volume-control device, SR&D introduced the Rockman, a small and inexpensive guitar amplifier with headphones. The Rockman proved phenomenally popular with other musicians, and the capital generated from its sales helped fund Scholz's further musical ambitions. ~ Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Rock","is_published":true,"record_label":"Frontiers Records 2013, previously Sony Legacy Recordings","talking_about_count":26482,"username":"bandboston","website":"http:\/\/www.bandboston.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"259521330754606","name":"Boston","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bandboston","likes":1262754,"cover":{"cover_id":661703063869762,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1391615_661703063869762_819413433_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Later that year, on December 2, 2000, Thal\u00eda married the former president of Sony Music, Tommy Mottola, at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York in a three-million dollar ceremony and reception. They currently live in New York City.\n\nThal\u00eda has also worked as a record producer, composer, TV and radio host, fashion designer, magazine editor, and model. Thal\u00eda has been a guest on television programs like Entertainment Tonight, El Show de Cristina, Good Morning America, Hard Copy, The Rosie O'Donnell Show and 20\/20.\n\nIn 2007, she joined the ABC Network in order to start the radio program \"The Conexi\u00f3n Thal\u00eda Radio Show,\" where she talks about music, fashion, news and political issues.\n\nOn June 12, 2007, according to news released on the website of Hello! magazine, Thal\u00eda in an exclusive interview for the Mexican edition of \u00a1Hola!, announced that she was pregnant. On October 7, 2007, Thal\u00eda and Tommy Mottola welcomed their first child together, a girl named Sabrina Saka\u00eb...\n\nOn December 1, 2009 Thal\u00eda released her latest musical work called \"Thalia En Primera Fila.\"","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"New York City","genre":"Latin Pop","hometown":"Mexico City, Mexico","is_published":true,"record_label":"SONY MUSIC LATIN","talking_about_count":563005,"username":"Thalia","website":"http:\/\/www.thalia.com http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/thalia http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/thaliavevo http:\/\/instagram.com\/thalia http:\/\/pinterest.com\/LadyTH\/ http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/thalia http:\/\/www.thaliaradio.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"19717739728","name":"Thalia","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Thalia","likes":6934494,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151957248804729","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1458418_10151957248804729_613135872_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"THE OFFICIAL IMMORTAL FACEBOOK PAGE!  *Please note that all profiles claiming to be Abbath or Horgh on Facebook, MySpace or any other social media are FAKE.* ","band_members":"Abbath - guitars\/vocals\nHorgh - drums\nApollyon - bass\nDemonaz - lyrics\n\n\n","bio":"Over the last eleven years, Immortal have slowly \u2013 but not always quietly \u2013 established themselves as a leading act in black metal. With the recent passing of the last emperor, the black metal world is like a snake with no head, a writhing mass of coiled muscle wasting away under the weight of its own grimness. It\u2019s time for the true successor to step forward and seize the abdicated throne. And I promise you this, true believers, it won\u2019t be a gaggle of major label limeys in Halloween costumes sporting bad dye jobs and fake blood.\n\nImmortal\u2019s conquest began in 1991. Abbath (ex-Old Funeral) and Demonaz (ex-Amputation) came together with the singular desire to create icy, uncompromising black metal. Their modus operandi was simple: spikes, corpsepaint and music caustic enough to sear the ears of their enemies. An undeniable love for Bathory, Venom and Slayer peppered their early work, as is evident on their debut release, Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism. Abbath handled bass in the old days with Demonaz on guitar. The drummer slot took on nearly Spinal Tap proportions as the throne had a constantly rotating roster including Armagedda, Grim (ex-Borknagar) and Hellhammer (Mayhem). At times Abbath himself even sat behind the kit, as on Pure Holocaust and Battles in the North.\n\nDespite being essentially a two-piece, Immortal created an indelible niche for themselves by writing frosty, fast and catchy songs laden with fantasy-tinged lyrics about a mystical, icy place known only as Blashyrk. With Hellhammer on drums, the band embarked on their first big European tour with Morbid Angel in 1995. The tour only served to raise their status. After 1997\u2019s Blizzard Beasts, which saw the addition of the titan known simply as Horge, Demonaz experienced severe nerve damage in his hand that prevented him from further playing guitar. Abbath changed to guitar, and the band found a temporary bass player in Ares from Aeternus. Demonaz stayed active with the band writing all the lyrics and serving as the band\u2019s manager. In 1999, the band returned stronger than before and clearly established the definitive Immortal sound with At the Heart of Winter and its follow-up Damned in Black. Rounded out by new bassist Iscariah, Immortal stood above the others, as the records received incredible press worldwide. U.S. audiences even got a small taste of the band live, as they did a week of dates with fellow Norwegians Satyricon.\n\nDamned in Black finished the band\u2019s deal with Osmose Productions. The band signed with Nuclear Blast Records for the world and will see proper distribution in the U.S. for the first time with their seventh release Sons of Northern Darkness. Once again recorded at Abyss Studios and produced by Peter T\u00e4gtgren (Hypocrisy), who also produced the last two, SOND continues in the great Immortal tradition of thick riffs, pounding drums, grim-throated vocals and an undeniable hook of melody that ties it all together. And as the black metal throne now stands vacant, Immortal stake their claim with a prophecy-fulfilling lyric from \"In My Kingdom Cold\": \"At the mountains of madness\/Unending grimness this kingdom is mine.\"","booking_agent":"Arnulf Woock -  NB Touring,  aw[at]nbtouring.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Bergen, Norway","genre":"Black Metal","hometown":"Bergen, Norway","is_published":true,"press_contact":"mail[at]nuclearblastusa.com (US) \/ info[at]nuclearblast.de (EU)","record_label":"Nuclear Blast Records","talking_about_count":4928,"username":"immortalofficial","website":"www.immortalofficial.com www.facebook.com\/immortalofficial www.twitter.com\/immortalband https:\/\/plus.google.com\/116375350173761466526 www.youtube.com\/user\/immortal www.jsrdirect.com\/cgi-bin\/category.cgi?category=IMM www.myspace.com\/immortalofficial ****PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL ONLINE PROFILES FOR ABBATH AND HORGH ARE FAKE!!!!!**** ","were_here_count":0,"id":"7973092317","name":"Immortal","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/immortalofficial","likes":868889,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150665065407318","source":"http:\/\/sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/s720x720\/424843_10150665065407318_1431491503_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"new single 'human' available now http:\/\/smarturl.it\/CPHuman","band_interests":"music + creativity + tea + pianos + guitars + tattoos + chocolate + palm trees + family ","band_members":"christina perri.\nlovechristina\u0040christinaperri.com","bio":"In July 2010, a struggling singer-songwriter and musician named Christina Perri had a life-changing moment when she was asked to perform a song she had written, a defiant break-up anthem called \u201cJar of Hearts,\u201d on the Fox show So You Think You Can Dance. The raw, emotional quality of her performance connected with viewers and catapulted the 24-year-old Philadelphia native into the public eye. \u201cJar of Hearts\u201d went on to sell a million downloads and land Perri, who was then supporting herself as a caf\u00e9 manager in Beverly Hills, a deal with Atlantic Records.  \n\n\u201cJar of Hearts\u201d is just one of 12 brutally honest gems that Perri unveils on her debut album lovestrong., a title she says reflects how her heart feels today. \u201cI looked at the album as a whole piece and the two themes that stood out were love and strength,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really titled itself. Writing about love is just who I am. I\u2019ve tried to write about other things, but ultimately this is what comes out of me.\u201d\n\nPerri lays herself bare on lovestrong., using her soaring, bittersweet voice and expressive piano playing to sketch out her stories. Some, like \u201cPenguin\u201d and \u201cArms,\u201d are happy and hopeful, some, like \u201cBang Bang Bang\u201d and \u201cMine,\u201d are fun and playful, and others, like \u201cThe Lonely\u201d and \u201cJar of Hearts,\u201d are downright wrenching. The common thread? \u201cThey\u2019re all songs I felt I needed to give away,\u201d she says. \u201cI have been writing songs since I was 15, so I reached into my arsenal and picked the ones I felt others should hear. My intention for my music is pretty simple: I want to make people feel less broken and alone.\u201d\n\nPerri sets lovestrong.\u2019s hopeful tone with the second single \u201cArms,\u201d a towering acoustic-guitar driven tune that builds to an urgent crescendo as its tale of the fight between the heart and the mind unfolds. \u201cYour heart wants to be loved, but your head is telling you that you shouldn\u2019t be with that person,\u201d Perri says. \u201cThe song is about that struggle and finally giving in and letting love win.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t really register how emotionally raw the album was going to be until Perri\u2019s 20th day in the recording studio. \u201cIn the vocal booth, I had to go back to the place and time that made me feel so vulnerable and rip open old wounds to sing each song, sometimes two songs in a day,\u201d she says. \u201cEmotionally, it was the hardest 33 days of my life, but it was worth it because the result is that this album is 100 percent me. It\u2019s heartfelt, real, bold, honest, vulnerable, hopeful, strong, poetic, bluesy, gritty, pretty, and simple.\u201d\n\nProduced by Joe Chiccareli (White Stripes, Tori Amos) and mixed by Michael Brauer (Coldplay, Regina Spektor), lovestrong. boasts a bold creative vision that is very much in keeping with Perri\u2019s spirited personality. A petite, tattooed ball of energy with an engaging smile, she has always embraced life to the fullest. Her adventures have included touring the world as an assistant to a rock band, spending a year at a prestigious university, producing popular music videos, making olive oil in Italy, and even serving as a fashionista barrista in Beverly Hills.\n\nOn June 30th, 2010, Perri got word that \u201cJar of Hearts\u201d was going to air on So You Think You Can Dance as a backdrop to a memorable piece choreographed by Stacey Tookey. Viewers began downloading the song from iTunes in droves, sending \u201cJar of Hearts\u201d into the Top 10 on the iTunes Pop chart and into the Top 15 on the Overall chart overnight. Impressed, SYTYCD\u2019s producers invited Perri to play the song live on the show two weeks later. After Perri performed the song on July 15th, \u201cJar of Hearts\u201d landed at No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, at No. 1 on Amazon\u2019s digital singles chart, and sold 200,000 downloads in three weeks. \u201cWhile all of this was happening, I barely slept,\u201d Perri says, \u201cbecause I was afraid it was just a dream; that I\u2019d wake up and none of it would be real. One minute I didn\u2019t exist in the music world and the next minute I did.\u201d\n\nPerri had actually been preparing for her big moment since she was a child. The daughter of hairdressers (whom she describes as \u201cnot musical, though my mom can whistle in many octaves\u201d), Perri first sang in public at her Holy Communion at age six. Piano lessons began at age 8, but her piano teacher \u201cfired\u201d her (as she puts it), because \u201cI would change the endings to the songs when I didn\u2019t like the way they were written.\u201d Eventually, Perri picked up a guitar and taught herself to play. She was in London working as a gofer for her brother\u2019s band Silvertide when she got word that she had been accepted to Philadelphia\u2019s prestigious University of the Arts with a sizeable scholarship. She attended for a year, but took a leave of absence to visit her father\u2019s extensive family in Italy. \u201cI was 19 and I needed to soul search,\u201d she says. \u201cI was still writing music, but I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do with my life.\u201d \n\nStill searching, Perri moved to Los Angeles with a suitcase and a guitar and recommitted herself to being a singer and a songwriter. She posted YouTube videos of herself performing her own songs, as well as covers, and shared her struggles in her uniquely humorous way. A video of one of her original compositions, \u201cTragedy\u201d (which is included on lovestrong.), caught the attention of Bill Silva Management, who signed on to represent her. And so began Perri\u2019s charmed odyssey. She will hit the road for spring tour with James Blunt as she awaits the May 10th release of lovestrong. \n\n\u201cEvery day something happens that blows my mind,\u201d she says. \u201cBeing able to wake up and play music is more than I\u2019ve ever dreamed my life could be. I\u2019m looking forward to sharing my experiences, my hope, my strength, my guts, and my heart with the world.\u201d ","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"hollywood, ca.

P\u00e9rez was the lead guitarist for his wife Selena's band Selena y Los Dinos. P\u00e9rez met Selena in 1988. Two years later, the Quintanilla family hired him to play in Selena's band and the pair fell in love. He and Selena were married on April 2, 1992 in Nueces County, Texas, when she was 20 and he was 22.\n\nAt the 1999 Grammy Awards his eponymously titled group, Chris P\u00e9rez Band, won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock\/Alternative Album for their album Resurrection. In this album P\u00e9rez dedicated the song, \"Best I Can\", to his wife, Selena. In 2002, Chris P\u00e9rez Band made their final album called Una Noche M\u00e1s.\n\nAfter the Chris P\u00e9rez Band disbanded, P\u00e9rez joined A.B. Quintanilla's music group, Los Kumbia Kings, in 2003. Los Dinos performed together at the Selena \u00a1VIVE! tribute concert on April 7, 2005. In the summer of 2006, A.B. Quintanilla started a new band called Kumbia All Starz, with P\u00e9rez as their lead guitarist. In mid 2009, Chris P\u00e9rez announced he would be forming his own band along with Angel Ferrer (former frontman and vocalist of Austin, Tx's Ill Camino rock outfit). The two quickly began developing a unique writing style and with the addition of band member  Robin Lopez (drums) they assembled an electrifying live performance outfit.\n\nDeeply connected to their hispanic heritage but loving the vibe of American Rock the Chris Perez Project delivers a sound infused with swaggering guitar riffs , stadium size hooks and captivating lyrics.

{"about":"#Matangi out now: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/matangi\nwww.miauk.com","band_members":"\u0040MIAuniverse","bio":"Once there was a girl named Matangi. This was 5000 years ago. Her father was an untouchable fearsome fighter and was a sage who gained sublime power through ascetic practice over thousands of years, and Matangi became known as a goddess of music and spoken word; she wasn\u2019t a warrior but rather a minister sometimes referred to as the Queen of Queens. She spoke truth to power by communicating from the heart, if we\u2019re not speaking from the heart our words are false and lack meaning. Matangi is often depicted carrying a sword in her battle to protect promise of freedom that words possess and the intrinsic value of that ideas contain; she also carries a parrot, a bird smart enough to say something but not intelligent enough to know what it\u2019s saying, a reminder to humankind of the inherent danger in all our babbling communications. Matangi is the only goddess who didn\u2019t live in the clouds or in a palace, she made her temple as a shack in the ghetto where she walked in the street with outcasts and undesirables to deepen her understanding of what pollutes our society, not just detritus and effluvia but the harsh sonics, foul speech and hateful thoughts that poison us daily. Her mudra is two raised middle fingers with the hands locked in a sort of lovers embrace, her mantra is Aim, hers is the path of inner thought manifested in an artistic way but this energy can take any form, any of the 64 forms of artistry known as Kala.\n\nOnce there was a girl named Mathangi, let\u2019s call her Maya. Maya grew up on Temple Road in a tough town called Jaffna, where she learned to sing and dodge the bullets of soldiers who sometimes shot out the windows of her school. She knew her father was a freedom fighter for people who could not fight, she never saw him, she was raised by her mother and the way things go grew up to be a rapper who made her home in cities, in London, in Los Angeles, in New York City.\n\nFrom the very beginning her music was always an explosion of color, light, heat; she named her first album Arular after her father the fighter\u2019s wartime sobriquet.  It was her father from whom she learned basic concepts and values and so Arular surprised and delighted as an exposition of apprenticeship in all the flows and feelings bubbling up from the streets at the time.\n\nShe named her second album after her mother Kala who taught her early lessons in creativity. She made Kala everywhere she could and as a delirious confection of worldly pop perfection Kala went everywhere it could, from endlessly bootlegged CDs to blockbuster soundtracks to improbable remixes with monsters of rap and suddenly there she was onstage at the Grammys a few days before giving birth, all of it made wild sense when previously it had been impossible to imagine.\n\nHer third album was Maya. Maya was about truth and lies, freedom of speech and the struggle of media in a time when the CIA battles Hezbollah via Twitter.   We all tweet incessantly the way parrots in the jungle do; we never consider how far the smallest idea can travel and how it can affect the people it reaches.  You would consider Maya to be an eponymous release were it not for the fact this was never her actual factual name.   Maya is the manifestation of the physical world, the illusion of this dusty net in which we live, the most negative aspect you must overcome to reach nirvana. Some loved Maya and some hated Maya and that is the duality of Maya.   You either love the material world and believe in material girls or you break it all down, move past it altogether, it was never a real place, it\u2019s not where you end up, once you pass it you arrive at Matangi.\n","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"Sri Lanka (via), London and South East United Kingdom","is_published":true,"record_label":"N.E.E.T.\/Interscope Records","talking_about_count":6823,"username":"miauk","website":"http:\/\/miauk.com\/ http:\/\/twitter.com\/MIAuniverse","were_here_count":0,"id":"19794112072","name":"MIA","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/miauk","likes":1048721,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151722128467073","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/2557_10151722128467073_1542093673_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The Clash Sound System: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/SoundSystem_Amz and The Clash Hits Back: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/HitsBack_iT Available now. ","band_members":"Former members:\nJoe Strummer, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon, Topper Headon, Keith Levene, Terry Chimes, Rob Harper, Pete Howard, Nick Sheppard, Vince White","bio":"The members of the Clash were drawn together in 1976, at which point \u00ecthe insurgent spirit of '60s rock was well and truly dead,' as Gilbert writes. The explosion of the punk scene in England that year gave rise to a rash of bands, 'who channeled the anger and frustration on the streets of gloomy mid-'70s Britain into a new kind of cauterising, anti-establishment rock \u00edn roll.' The first indictments served by the Clash came in the form of their debut single (on CBS Records\/U.K.), 'White Riot,' issued March 1977, inspired by Strummer and Simonon\u00eds attendance at the riot during that year\u00eds Notting Hill Carnival, London\u00eds annual Afro-Caribbean Festival.\n\n'White Riot' set the pattern for the Clash \u00f1 biting, politically charged lyrics underpinned by a musical bed that owed as much of a debt to the minimalist garage-punk ethic of the Stooges and MC5 as it did to Lee Perry and London\u00eds transplanted ska and reggae roots rockers. This sound that dominated their self-titled British debut LP of early, 1977, The Clash ('White Riot,' 'London\u00eds Burning,''\u00ecI\u00edm So Bored With the U.S.A.,' 'Career Opportunities,' 'Hate & War,''Cheat,' 'Janie Jones,' '\u00ecGarageland,' and the cover of Junior Murvin\u00eds 'Police & Thieves'). Recorded over the course of three weeks, the LP quickly reached ..12 on the U.K. national chart. The Clash was established as a headline act in Great Britain and Europe from their very first tours.\n\nTrue to British form, the Clash began recording and releasing new non-LP singles in mid-\u00ed77. Meanwhile, the debut LP had gone unreleased in America where import sales reportedly topped 100,000 units, making it the best-selling import in history. When Epic\/U.S. finally released the album later in 1978, it was resequenced, various tracks were deleted, and several (though not all) of the post-LP U.K. single sides were added, notably Jamaican Lee Perry\u00eds one-off production of 'Complete Control,' a cover of the Bobby Fuller Four\u00eds 'I Fought the Law,' and the most recent U.K. 45s, the infectious 'Clash City Rockers' and blistering '(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais.'\n\nWith an eye and ear cast on America, the Clash was hooked up with producer Sandy Pearlman (of Blue \u00f7yster Cult renown) who worked with his new assignees in London, San Francisco and New York. Give \u00edEm Enough Rope, issued worldwide (in one version) in November 1978, showed a tougher rock sound. Strummer found an intellectual peer in Pearlman and the band\u00eds scope broadened to tackle (in Gilbert\u00eds words) 'international terrorism, murderous political regimes, and visions of an imminent English Civil War ('English Civil War,' 'Tommy Gun,' 'Safe European Home,' 'Julie\u00eds Been Working For the Drug Squad,' 'Stay Free').\n\nThe Americanization of the Clash may have been evident when they invited Bo Diddley along as opening act on their first U.S. tour in early \u00ed79. But it reached a peak of sorts with their third album, London Calling, released at the end of the year, produced by Guy Stevens, known for his work with Mott the Hoople. The ambitious double-LP set incorporated rockabilly, soul and R&B, even a taste of jazz ('London Calling,' 'The Guns of Brixton,' 'Clampdown,' 'Rudie Can\u00edt Fail,''\u00ecLost In the Supermarket,' 'Jimmy Jazz,' 'Train In Vain'). The Clash\u00eds first platinum album would earn Rolling Stone\u00eds endorsement years later as \u00ecthe greatest album of the \u00ed80s.'\n\nIn order to accommodate the prolific outpouring of songs from Strummer and Jones, the even-more ambitious triple-LP Sandinista! was issued in late 1980 ('The Magnificent Seven,' 'Ivan Meets G.I. Joe,' 'Police On My Back,' 'Street Parade'). The Clash had become traffic-stopping front-page news by then, whose albums were paced with a flow of non-LP single sides and 10-inch EPs. A number of these sides (\u00ecBankrobber,' 'Stop the World,' \u00ecThis Is Radio Clash') would take a decade or more to show up on full-fledged album collections. \n\nThe machinations of the rock life caught up with the Clash in 1982, not long after the May 1982 release of their fifth album Combat Rock ('Ghetto Defendant,' 'Rock the Casbah,' 'Straight To Hell,' 'Should I Stay Or Should I Go?'). Ironically, the album gave the Clash its first real Top 10 hit and, at the dawning of MTV, a visual cue as well. 'Rock the Casbah,' though co-written by Headon, could not avert his ouster from the band. A year later, Strummer and Simonon decided it was time for Jones to depart as well (he resurfaced on Columbia in 1985 with Big Audio Dynamite). \n\nThe Clash forged on with one last album, Cut The Crap ('This Is England'), but their legend endured with collections and anthologies that wrapped up many loose ends \u00f1 demos, live recordings, outtakes, non-album single and EP sides and so on \u00f1 well into the '90s and beyond.

{"about":"THE OFFICIAL PAGE!","band_members":"Shagrath - vocals\nSilenoz - guitars\nGalder - guitars\n\nCurrent live line-up:\nDaray - drums\nGerlioz (Brat) - keys\nCyrus - bass","bio":"BACKGROUND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION: Dimmuborgir (pronounced \u201cDIM-moo bor-GEAR\u201d) is a large area of unusually shaped lava fields that includes various cave and rock formations east of Lake M\u1ef7vatn on Iceland. While the word \u201cdimmu\u201d means \u201cfog\/dark,\u201d and \u201cborgir\u201d means \u201ccastle\/fortress,\u201d and the lava fields were named after the Kirkjan (\u201cThe Church\u201d) cave with the high, gothic-styled vaulted ceiling, the area is commonly referred to as \u201cthe Gates to Hell.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the not-so-mythical world of Norway\u2019s DIMMU BORGIR - thee most prominent melodic black metal act in the world.\n\nFounded in 1993 by lead singer Shagrath, guitarist Silenoz, and drummer Tjodalv, DIMMU BORGIR made their debut onto the underground metal scene via a limited 7\u201d vinyl EP entitled Inn I Evighetens Morke (\u201cInto The Eternity Of Darkness\u201d) in 1994. Inspired by early incarnations of black metal from the 1980s and inspired by the works of classical composers such as Wagner and Dvorak, the band\u2019s music was resplendent in its raw & melodic vocals, aggressive guitar work, destructive drums, and haunting keyboard melodies. Less than a year later, the band (now a 5-piece) recorded their now-classic full-length debut, For All Tid, to wild acclaim. While DIMMU BORGIR\u2019s reputation gained momentum throughout Scandinavia, the band focused their energies on recording what was to become one of the most essential albums in black metal history, Stormbl\u00e5st, which \u2013 although sung completely in Norwegian - catapulted them out of Europe and into international (albeit still underground) waters. Though displaying a marked escalation in their time signatures, DIMMU BORGIR made significant headway in defining their classically influenced sound that would become an intrinsic blueprint.\n\nFollowing Stormbl\u00e5st, DIMMU BORGIR decided to record in English to reach a broader audience, and the result was 1997\u2019s commanding masterpiece, Enthrone Darkness Triumphant. Produced by the one-and-only living legend Peter T\u00e4gtgren (Hypocrisy, Pain) at Abyss Studios (Immortal, Destruction, Children Of Bodom), the album was released by Nuclear Blast and marked the band\u2019s significant international breakthrough with over 150,000 copies sold and chart entries all over the world. Included in this breakthrough year were performances at some of the most esteemed European music festivals such as Germany\u2019s Dynamo and Wacken Open Air.\n\nAfter their world tour for Enthroned Darkness Triumphant, DIMMU BORGIR recorded the Godless Savage Garden mini-CD to hold fans over as they curiously waited to see what direction the next full-length, Spiritual Black Dimensions, would take. Once again recorded at Abyss Studios with Peter T\u00e4gtgren, the album stormed into music stores around the world in 1999 and single-handedly transformed the market for black metal. Those who ever doubted DIMMU BORGIR\u2019s allegiance to extreme music were forced to face reality when the album proved to be their most complex and severe offering.\n\nDIMMU suffered a setback when long-time drummer Tjodalv resigned from the band in the early stages of their 1999 tour. His replacement was none other than former Cradle Of Filth skinsman Nick Barker, whose presence among vocalist Shagrath, guitarists Silenoz & Galder, bassist & clean vocalist I.C.S. Vortex, and keyboard player Mustis complemented the band\u2019s already impressive lineage. The sextet entered Sweden\u2019s Fredman Studio in the fall of 2000 with the equally acclaimed producer Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m (At The Gates, Opeth, In Flames) to record Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia, and did not fail to create an uncompromising 11 tracks of audible malevolence and exceptional atmospherics. Released in 2001, Puritanical expanded DIMMU\u2019s audience even more, and 2003\u2019s self-produced Death Cult Armageddon proved to be no different. Debuting on Billboard\u2019s Top 200 Albums chart and entering at #7 on Billboard\u2019s Heatseekers chart, Death Cult Armageddon went on to sell over 100,000 records in North America alone. DIMMU BORGIR not only landed a coveted spot on Ozzfest\u2019s Main Stage in 2004, but they were showcased in MTV\u2019s reality series \u201cBattle For Ozzfest,\u201d and the dark orchestrations of their \u201cProgenies Of The Great Apocalypse\u201d track was selected for use in the trailer for Guillermo del Toro\u2019s film, Hellboy.\n\nRecruiting the prolific drummer Hellhammer (Mayhem, Arcturus, Winds) for session work in last year\u2019s re-recording of Stormbl\u00e5st (produced by Peter T\u00e4gtgren) and boasting his session work in the recording for their first studio album in four years, 2007\u2019s In Sorte Diaboli is DIMMU BORGIR's first concept album. An epic story set in medieval Europe, In Sorte Diaboli is a treatise on modern day political and social abuses of organized religion. This first-person account of an acolyte is told through his own journal entries, depicting his personal struggle with the teachings of the church. Experiencing a life-altering epiphany, he abandons the church completely, and his spiritual victory is won through his rejection of the concept of god. Produced by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m and Patrik J. Sten at Sweden\u2019s (in)famous Studio Fredman, the dark grandiosity of \u201cThe Serpentine Offering,\u201d the elegant ferocity of \u201cThe Sacrilegious Scorn,\u201d the impending doom of \u201cThe Fallen Arises,\u201d and the unforgiving death march of \u201cThe Ancestral Fever\u201d have all fused together to create what has been praised as \u201cthe most complete symphonic black metal record\u201d by Metal Maniacs Magazine.\n\nIn Sorte Diaboli welcomes you to the battle that will never end.

{"about":"THE CURE'S OFFICIAL FACEBOOK PAGE","band_members":"Robert Smith\nPorl Thompson\nSimon Gallup\nJason Cooper","bio":"The Cure Story...\n\n\nIt all started in 1976 as 'Easy Cure', formed by Robert Smith (vocals,\n\nguitar) along with schoolmates Michael Dempsey (bass), Lol Tolhurst\n\n(drums) and local guitar hero Porl Thompson. They began writing and demoing their own songs almost immediately, playing throughout 1977 in Southern England to an ever growing army of fans. In 1978 the 'Easy' was dropped, along with Porl, and an eager trio now known simply as The Cure were quickly signed to Chris Parry's new Fiction label.\n\n\nIn May 1979 their debut album Three Imaginary Boys was released to great acclaim, and as the band toured extensively around the UK, the singles \"Boys Don't Cry\" and \"Jumping Someone Else's Train\" were released. Michael left the band at the end of the year, and Simon Gallup (bass) and Matthieu Hartley (keyboards) joined. In early 1980 the 4-piece Cure embarked on an exploration of the darker side of Robert's songwriting, and emerged with the minimalist classic Seventeen Seconds, along with their first bona-fide 'hit single' \"A Forest.\"\n\n\nAfter an intense world tour Matthieu left the group, and in early 1981 the trio recorded an album of mournful atmospheric soundscapes entitled Faith, which included another successful single in \"Primary.\" The band then set out on a second global trek, named \"The Picture Tour,\" during which they released the non-album single \"Charlotte Sometimes.\" In 1982 The Cure went back into the studio, and their increasingly ugly fascination with despair and decay culminated in the unrelenting sonic attack of Pornography. An intensely volatile tour ensued, and the single \"The Hanging Garden\" was released just as Simon left the band.\n\n\nAfter pushing the limits of excess, Robert felt he had to change things, and did so by 'going pop' again. Rejuvenated, the now 2-piece Cure released their first real dance single, the cheesy \"Let's Go To Bed,\" and during the making of the accompanying video forged a colorful and lasting relationship with director Tim Pope. The band continued into 1983 with the groovy electronic dance of \"The Walk,\" followed by the demented cartoon jazz of \"The Lovecats.\" In 1984 The Top was released, a strange hallucinogenic mix, which contained the infectiously psychedelic single \"The Caterpillar.\" The world 'Top Tour' saw the band expand to a 5-piece, with the addition of Andy Anderson (drums) and Phil Thornalley (bass), and the return of Porl Thompson (guitar).\n\n\nThe new Cure sound was captured live for the album Concert. Andy and Phil left soon after the end of the tour, and were replaced by Boris Williams (drums) and further returnee Simon Gallup (bass). This new incarnation started work on 1985's The Head On The Door with a very real sense of 'something happening'... The vibrant hit single \"Inbetween Days\" was followed up by \"Close To Me,\" and the ensuing world tour paved the way for the massive success of the singles collection Standing On A Beach in 1986. That summer saw the band headline the Glastonbury Festival for the first time, and a year of extensive gigs and festivals was crowned by Tim Pope's live concert film The Cure In Orange.\n\n\nIn 1987 The Cure brought out Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, an immense double album of extreme and extraordinary stylistic range, and with the arrival of Roger O'Donnell on keyboards the 6-piece Cure traveled the world with the 'Kissing Tour', enjoying 4 more hit singles along the way. The wonderfully atmospheric Disintegration was demoed in 1988 and released in 1989, and despite being a work of powerful brooding grandeur, it too gave rise to 4 hit singles. The awesome 'Prayer Tour' that followed, with the band back down to a 5-piece following the departure of Lol Tolhurst, included some of The Cure's best performances to date, and was captured live for the album Entreat.\n\n\nIn early 1990 Roger O'Donnell left the group, and was replaced by long-time band friend Perry Bamonte, just in time for a series of headlining European festival shows that included the band's second Glastonbury headline slot. The album Mixed Up was released, supported by the re-mixed singles \"Never Enough,\" \"Close To Me\" and \"A Forest,\" and in 1991 The Cure at last won some long overdue \"home\" recognition with a Brit Award for \"Best British Group.\"\n\n\nIn 1992 they recorded Wish, a richly diverse multi-faceted guitar driven album hailed by some as their best work to date. It spawned 3 fabulous hit singles, and the glorious 'Wish Tour' that followed was a worldwide sell out. The sheer power of the shows inspired the release of two live works in 1993, Paris and Show. Immediately after the tour ended, guitarist Porl Thompson left the band again (this time with a smile!), and The Cure headlined the XFM 'Great Xpectations Show' in London's Finsbury Park as a 4-piece. The band also contributed '\"urn\" to the film \"The Crow\" and covered \"Purple Haze\" for the Hendrix tribute album 'Stone Free'.\n\n\nIn 1994 Boris Williams decided to move on, and in early 1995 Jason Cooper took up residency behind the drum kit, with Roger O'Donnell rejoining once more on keyboards. Work on the next album was interspersed with recording \"Dredd Song\" for the film \"Judge Dredd,\" a cover of Bowie's \"Young Americans\" for an XFM album, and headlining several major European festivals, including the 25th Glastonbury. Wild Mood Swings was released in 1996, and went straight into almost every top ten around the world. The Cure hit the road once more with 'The Swing Tour', their longest to date, and released 4 more singles.\n\n\nGalore, the follow up singles and video compilation to Standing On A Beach, was released in 1997, after which work took place in 1998 on a variety of projects, including \"More than This\" for the \"X Files\" album, and a memorable appearance by Robert in \"South Park!\" In 1999 the band completed the recording and mixing of what many regard as their best studio album so far, the Grammy Nominated Bloodflowers. With it's release in 2000 the band set off on the massive world-wide 'Dreamtour' - playing to more than a million people in 9 months.\n\n\n2001 saw the long awaited release of the Cure's \"Greatest Hits\" album, which featured all the band's biggest selling singles along with 2 new songs, the elegiac \"Cut Here\" and the ebullient \"Just Say Yes,\" a duet with Saffron. This year also saw the end of the group's relationship with Fiction Records, the label they had been instrumental in starting 23 years before.\n\n\nIn2002 the band spent the summer headlining a number of European Festivals before going into rehearsals for two very special nights in November at the Tempodrom Berlin, where they performed all the tracks from Pornography, Disintegration and Bloodflowers plus encores! Both performances were shot in Hi-Def video on 12 cameras, and Trilogy DVD was released in 2003 as another chapter of The Cure story opened, the band signing a 3 album global deal with the Geffen label.\n\n\n2004 saw the release of Join the Dots, a 4cd Boxset of all the B-sides and Rarities, followed by the widely acclaimed new album The Cure, and another hugely successful world tour. In 2005 Perry Bamonte and Roger O'Donnell left the band and Porl Thompson joined for a third time.

{"about":"All things Journey.","band_members":"Neal Schon (guitars, vocals), Jonathan Cain (keyboards, vocals), Ross Valory (bass, vocals), Deen Castronovo (drums, percussion, vocals), Arnel Pineda (lead vocals)","bio":"In 2008, Journey introduced a new singer to the world, Arnel Pineda, with the release of their 14th studio album (\"Revelation\") and an extraordinarily successful world tour. It was the latest chapter in a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll saga that started more than 35 years ago and has produced some of the best-known rock songs of the 1970s and \u201880s.\n\nJourney's story begins in Northern California with guitarist Neal Schon, a child prodigy who dropped out of high school to join Santana just prior to the San Francisco band recording its third album. Schon, while in high school, had been jamming with Santana keyboardist Gregg Rolie, who ultimately would follow Schon into Journey. \n\nThe union of Santana and Schon was short-lived, but in that time period, Schon would meet a man who believed that a band formed around his guitar work would be a viable entity.\n\nWhen Schon left Santana, he explored the idea of a power trio with two former members of Sly and the Family Stone, drummer Greg Errico and bassist Larry Graham. Playing funk, however, limited Schon's amount of soloing, which prompted him to look for another musical vehicle. \n\nWalter \"Herbie\" Herbert, a guitar tech for Santana who had added management duties to his job, approached Schon in early 1973 about forming a guitar-centric band. Herbert has said Schon was \u201cthe quintessential guitar expressionist of the time\u201d and to further his career, Herbert connected Schon with two members of the popular local act Frumious Bandersnatch, former Steve Miller Band bassist Ross Valory and guitarist George Tickner. They enlisted drummer Prairie Prince, a member of the Tubes, and the all-instrumental act began performing as the Golden Gate Rhythm Section.\n\nThey developed a local following, one that was strong enough for San Francisco FM station KSAN to hold a contest to see if a better name could be given to the GGRS. \n\nThe contest yielded the moniker Journey. New name in place, Rolie joined the band in the summer of 1973.\n\nThe first edition of Journey developed a largely instrumental progressive rock sound. The first change in personnel came in early 1974 when Aynsley Dunbar, a British drummer who spent time in the bands of Jeff Beck, Frank Zappa and John Mayall, took the place of Prince, who decided to stay with the Tubes.\n\nCBS\/Columbia Records signed that lineup in November 1974, but by the time \"Journey,\" their debut album, was released, Tickner had left to attend medical school. Tickner, whose compositions were the backbone of Journey's earliest repertoire, was not replaced, making the band a single-guitar outfit.\n\nEach of the band's first three albums - \"Journey\" (1975), \"Look Into the Future\" (1976) and \"Next\" (1977) - charted higher than the previous release. And the band maintained a grueling touring schedule, staying on the road nine months per year performing music that Schon has referred to as \"a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll version of the Mahavishnu Orchestra.\"\n\nBut sales were not as strong as the label had hoped and the band was asked to hire a full-time lead singer. (Rolie had handled vocals from behind his keyboards).\n\nThe first vocalist brought in was Robert Fleischman, who joined the band for a summer tour in 1977. While his songwriting contributions to the band included \u201cWheel In The Sky\u201d and \u201cWinds Of March,\u201d personality clashes resulted in Fleischman promptly leaving the band.  A young drummer and singer, Steve Perry, who had contacted Herbert several times, also received an endorsement from CBS, leading to him being tapped as Journey's new lead singer in October 1977. \n\nNot all of the members were sold on the idea of bringing the singer into the fold. But at their first meeting, in a hotel room, Schon and Perry collaborated on what would eventually become the song \u201cPatiently.\u201d\n\nRoy Thomas Baker was hired to produce their fourth album \u2013 and first with Perry - \u201cInfinity,\u201d which quickly went platinum after its release in April 1978. The album remained on the charts for more than two years, peaking at No. 21, and would ultimately sell 3 million copies.\n\nIn September 1978, Steve Smith, who had been Journey's drum roadie and a member of several hard rock and jazz-fusion bands, replaced Dunbar, who had joined Jefferson Starship.\n\n\u201cEvolution,\u201d which would become their second million-selling album, was released in May 1979. In October, they scored their first top 30 single with \"Lovin, Touchin', Squeezin'.\" \nMaintaining a torrid pace in the studio as well as on the road, it was only 11 months later that the band registered their first top 10 album. \u201cDeparture,\u201d which featured the leadoff single \u201cAny Way You Want It,\u201d reached No. 8 on the Billboard album chart. \n\nA live double album, \u201cCaptured,\u201d followed, becoming their fourth consecutive disc to go platinum.\n\nBefore the band returned to the studio Rolie departed, replaced by Jonathan Cain of the Babys. Adding Cain to the songwriting mix with Schon, Perry and Valory would result in Journey scoring the biggest hits of their career.\n\n\"Escape,\" released in September 1981, was the band\u2019s first No. 1 and would eventually be certified 8 times platinum, spending more than a year in the top 40. That album produced three of the best -known songs in the Journey canon: \"Don't Stop Believin',\" which hit No. 9; \"Who's Crying Now\" (No. 4); and \"Open Arms,\" which spent six weeks at No. 2 in 1982. \n\nWhile \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d would have its place in the sun years later as the final song on HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and as the theme song for the Chicago White Sox on their way to the 2005 World Series, at the time of release \u201cOpen Arms\u201d ushered in the power ballad into American pop music. The first songwriting collaboration between Cain and Perry, it quickly became the band\u2019s signature song at the time and would years later be covered by Mariah Carey.\n\nTheir popularity soaring, Journey became the first rock band to inspire a videogame. In the early \u201880s their concerts were visual spectacles as they revolutionized the use of big screens and computerized lighting systems.\n\nAnd with the advent of MTV, Journey's star only continued to rise.  One of the few 1970s rock bands to successfully make the transition into the video age, the follow-up to \u201cEscape,\u201d \u201cFrontiers,\u201d sat at No. 2 on the Billboard album chart in the spring of 1983. The album that kept them from the top slot was Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller,\u201d the biggest selling album of all time during the vinyl era.\n\nDuring this period, Schon and Perry opted to do solo projects as well. Schon reunited with keyboardist Jan Hammer \u2013 they had made an album together in 1981 \u2013 to record \u201cHere to Stay\u201d and made a live album, \u201cThrough the Fire,\u201d with Sammy Hagar, Kenny Aranson and former Santana percussionist Michael Shrieve. While Schon was experimenting with styles that did not fit within the Journey sound, Perry released the commercially targeted album \u201cStreet Talk.\u201d\n\nBetween 1983 and 1986 the band landed seven top 20 hits, among them \"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\" and \"Girl Can't Help It.\" In early 1985, their track for the film \u201cVision Quest,\u201d \u201cOnly the Young,\u201d hits No. 9 as the band members decided to relax their schedule.\n\nA year later, Schon, Cain and Perry returned without Valory or Smith, using studio musicians on \u201cRaised on Radio.\u201d It hit No. 4, spending almost seven months in the top 40, and the band toured with bassist Randy Jackson, who would years later become a judge on \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d and drummer Mike Baird.  \n\nThe group disbanded in 1989, seemingly for good, as Schon and Cain created Bad English with John Waite while Valory, Smith and Rolie joined the Storm. In 1993, the band reunited, sans Perry, for a Bay Area concert honoring their former manager Herbert.\n\nPerry, Schon, Cain, Smith and Valory reunited one last time for 1996's \"Trial By Fire.\" The dozen songs on the album were written in just two weeks. It opened at No. 3, yielded the Adult Contemporary hit single \"When You Love a Woman,\" which would garner the band their first Grammy nomination, and a 25-date tour was booked. Perry moved to Hawaii to get in shape, but while there he developed health problems and was eventually told he would need a hip replaced. The tour never took place and with no fanfare, the members of Journey went their separate ways.\n\nUltimately, Schon, Valory and Cain decided the band would forge ahead. Steve Augeri was brought in as lead singer and Dean Castronovo, a member of Bad English, replaced Smith on drums. (Smith joined the fusion act Vital Information). Their first recording as Journey was \u201cRemember Me\u201d for the \u201cArmageddon\u201d soundtrack.\n\n\u201cArrival,\u201d Journey's 11th studio album, was released in April 2001.  A 30th anniversary tour followed the release of \u201cGenerations\u201d in 2005. The tour featured shows that were more than three hours long and included material from every phase of the band\u2019s career. \n\nA year later, Jeff Scott Soto replaced Augeri, whose time in the band was cut short due to a throat infection. Soto\u2019s tenure was short-lived and in 2007, Journey tried a variety of ways to land a new singer. After two days of watching videos on YouTube, they came across a video featuring Arnel Pineda performing with a Journey cover band in the Philippines and booked him for an audition in the States. \n\nWithin just a few songs he had secured the job. Pineda made his debut with the album \u201cRevelation,\u201d which was sold exclusively at Walmart outlets and was certified platinum within several months of its release.\n\nMore than a million fans have seen Journey on tour since 2008 with Pineda as lead singer. After seven months on the road with Journey, Pineda told the media in Asia, \u201cThis is the best job in the world and as long as my band mates will let me rock with them, I will keep singing with Journey.\u201d\n","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"San Francisco, CA, Nashville, TN, Manila, Philippines","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":59727,"username":"journey","website":"http:\/\/www.journeymusic.com http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/journeyofficial http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/journey http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/journey http:\/\/www.schonmusic.com http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/schonmusic http:\/\/www.legacyrecordings.com\/artists\/journey http:\/\/www.ticketmaster.com\/Journey-tickets\/artist\/735415","were_here_count":0,"id":"5867843575","name":"Journey","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/journey","likes":4890949,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151681172688576","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc1\/s720x720\/1173698_10151681172688576_1440174568_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

For the better part of two years, Atmosphere toured the globe in support of their critically acclaimed - and #5 Billboard Top 200 charting - album, When LIfe Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold.  And in their \"spare\" time, the group returned home to Minneapolis in 2009 to record their 2010 double EP, To All My Friends, Blood Makes The Blade Holy, an homage to their friends.  \n\nIn 2011, Atmosphere is taking that feeling one step farther with this long awaited LP, The Family Sign, a tribute to their true extended family: their fans, their loved ones, and each other.\n\nThe Family Sign was written early in 2010, and as they sat down to record the record, the Family grew a few times over.  In the studio, Atmosphere was joined by long time touring musicians Nate \"The Guitar Man\" Collis (guitar) and Erick Anderson (keys). At home, 2010 also saw the addition of two real-life children to the Atmosphere family, further inspiring the writing process and the concept, and title, of the album.  \n\nThe Family Sign comes from a place well refined and firmly planted, from a universal perspective.  It's about being okay with losing friends and strengthening your bonds with others, celebrating the person who's been the most positive in your life, your kids, your homies, leaving the people you need to behind, and bringing the ones you love with you.  It's about your family, your time and the time you have with them.  It's about living and dying.  It's the truth about family, that it comes from loyalty as much as biology. It's about breaking down your perceptions of family and really appreciating the people who've made you who you are and continue doing so.\n\nThe Family Sign is Atmosphere's most personal and intimate album yet; it involves and engages the listener like never before.  Slug's signature voice weaves in and out of Ant's ASR-born production, Nate Collis' bluesy guitar riffs and the sound of Erick Anderson's unmistakable keys giving The Family Sign a fresh, unique edge without sacrificing Atmosphere's signature sound.

Originally formed as 'Legacy' in 1983 by founding members Eric Peterson (rhythm guitar), Derrick Ramirez (guitar) and Louie Clemente (drums), the line-up included vocalist Steve Souza and Greg Christian (bass). Ramirez was later replaced by wunderkind Alex Skolnick (lead guitar). Souza soon departed to join Exodus and suggested that the towering Chuck Billy take over as frontman. The band became known as 'Testament' 3 years later, while recording their debut album in Ithaca, New York.\n\n\"The Legacy\" was a brutal intro in 1987, putting Testament at the forefront of the flourishing thrash metal scene. Following \"Live At Eindhoven\", an EP recorded at Holland's Dynamo Festival, \"The New Order\" in 1988 was well received producing one of the band's most memorable classics \"Disciples Of The Watch\". Next came the highly successful \"Practice What You Preach\" in 1989, then the release of \"Souls Of Black\" in 1990, coinciding with the European 'Clash Of The Titans' tour with Slayer, Megadeth and Suicidal Tendencies.\n\nAfter \"The Ritual\" in 1992, Skolnick, whose musical tastes weren't limited to metal, departed the band and went on to become a respected jazz guitarist. Clemente also departed. \"Return To Apocalyptic City\" in 1993 brought Glen Alvelais (guitar, ex- Forbidden) into the fold, and filling in temporarily for Clemente, Paul Bostaph (ex- Forbidden, Slayer). James Murphy (ex- Death, Obituary, Disincarnate, Cancer) soon stepped in for Alvelais on lead duties for \"Low\" in 1994, as John Tempesta (ex- Exodus) took over on the drums. Tempesta later left to join White Zombie, and was replaced by John Dette (ex- Evil Dead ). \"Live At The Fillmore\" was released in 1995, then Dette left in 1996 to join Slayer. \"The Best Of Testament\" was released in 1996.\n\n\"Demonic\", which was recorded in Testament's Driftwood Studios, was released in 1997.

Gene Hoglan (drums, ex- Death, Dark Angel) lent his percussion talents. \"Signs Of Chaos\", a 'best of' disc of the band, was released in 1997.\n\nDave Lombardo (ex- Slayer, Grip, Inc.) was officially introduced into the band. James Murphy was brought back once again, and on bass, the legendary Steve DiGiorgio (ex- Death, Control Denied, Sadus). \"The Gathering\" was born in 1999. James Murphy abruptly departed, which was determined later for reasons due to a serious illness. Steve Smyth (ex-Vicious Rumors) jumped aboard as 'touring guitarist', later to be invited to stay on as a permanent member. Lombardo soon also left, not being able to commit, having other projects on his plate. In 2000, Jon Allen (drums, ex- Sadus) joined the band.\n\nAfter the successful \"Riding The Snake\" world tour to promote \"The Gathering\", vocalist Billy was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called 'germ cell seminoma' in March 2001. Despite his illness and grueling cancer treatments, Billy offered his ground shaking vocals to the re-recording of Testament classics on \"First Strike Still Deadly\" with a reunion of sorts, bringing back Alex Skolnick and John Tempesta to record on the disc.\n\nBilly has since fully recovered. A busy touring schedule of the U.S. and Europe commenced in late 2002, through the summer of 2003. In 2004, guitarist Steve Smyth left the band to join Nevermore, and \"Metal Mike\" Chlasciak stepped in.\n\n[Compiled by L.

{"about":"'Bad As Me' Available Now! http:\/\/www.tomwaits.com","band_members":"Tom Waits","bio":"Tom Waits, according to the esteemed American critic Robert Hilburn, is clearly one of the most important figures of the modern pop era. Such sentiments are not mere hyperbole; in a career that now spans four decades and over 20 albums, Tom Waits has long since emerged as an extraordinary innovative force, a singular voice whose music remains determinedly and even gloriously - well beyond the trivial fads and fashions of popular culture. Waits latest release, the 3CD set Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers and Bastards adds further weight to that stellar reputation. \n\nOrphans: Brawlers, Bawlers and Bastards is a wide-ranging collection of 54 songs - including 30 new recordings equaling over three hours of rare and never-before heard music. The set comes complete with a 94-page booklet. \n\nEach of the three CDs is separately grouped and sub-titled Brawlers, Bawlers and Bastards to capture the full spectrum of Waits ranging and roving musical styles. Brawlers is chock full of raucous blues and full-throated juke joint stomp; Bawlers comprises Celtic and country ballads, waltzes, lullabies, piano and classic lyrical Waits songs while Bastards is filled with experimental music and strange tales. \n\nIn addition to the new work, Orphans features a number of songs originally recorded for the cinema, the theatre and other projects but which now find a home on a Waits album for the first time. They include his unique interpretations of songs by such extraordinarily diverse talents as The Ramones, Daniel Johnston, Kurt Weill & Bertolt Brecht, Leadbelly, Sparklehorse, Charles Bukowski and Jack Kerouac. \n\n\"Orphans are rough and tender tunes. Rhumbas about mermaids, shuffles about trainwrecks, tarantellas about insects, madrigrals about drowning, says Waits. Scared, mean orphan songs of rapture and melancholy. Songs that grew up hard. Songs of dubious origin rescued from cruel fate\". \n\nOrphans: Brawlers, Bawlers and Bastards (Anti Records) is Waits first release since 2004s much-lauded Real Gone. The album was written and produced by Waits with his wife and long-time collaborator Kathleen Brennan and is released in the UK on Tuesday 21th November 2006. \n\n* * *\n\nIts been just over 30 years since Tom Waits made his recording debut. In that time his music has taken adventurous twists and turns, from confessional country-blues and jazz-flavoured lounge to primal rock and avant-garde musical theatre. By turns tender and poignant, strange and twisted, his songs have tended to explore the dark underbelly of society as he has given his voice to a litany of characters and tales on the fringe and in the fray. \n\nWaits has drawn from a deep well of song idioms; folk, blues, country, jazz ballads, polkas, waltzes, cabaret, swing, popular ballads and a category which by now can only be described as Waitsian. The tools of his trade have included such instruments and objects as the marimba; trombone; brake drum; metal aunglongs; banjo; bell plate; bullhorn; conga; accordion; optigon; mellotron; maracas; pump organ; basstarda; chamberlain; harmonium; viola; sticks; chairs and musical saw as well as the regular old guitar, bass, piano and drums. There is also, of course, his trademark gravelly voice. \n\nIn the early-Seventies Tom Waits worked as a doorman at the Heritage in San Diego, a nightclub where artists of every genre performed. An avid fan of such authors, songwriters, musicians and performers as Hoagy Carmichael, Lord Buckley, Bob Dylan, Stephen Foster, Raymond Chandler and Marty Robbins, Waits began developing his own idiosyncratic musical style, combining songs with monologues. He took his newly formed act to Monday nights at the Troubadour in LA, where musicians from all over stood in line all day to get the opportunity to perform on-stage that night. Shortly thereafter, Waits was signed to Asylum Records. He was 21 years old. \n\nWaits first formal recording, Closing Time, was released in 1973. Among the tracks was Ol 55, a song later covered by his labelmates The Eagles for their On the Border album. \n\nWaits began touring and opening in America for such artists as Charlie Rich, Martha & The Vandellas and Frank Zappa. As the decade unfolded, Waits gained increasing critical respect and a loyal cult audience with his subsequent albums The Heart of Saturday Night (1974); Nighthawks at the Diner (1975); Small Change (1976); Foreign Affairs (1977); Blue Valentine (1978) and Heartattack and Vine (1980). It was an incredibly prolific period for Waits, establishing his reputation as a visionary songwriter. \n\n* * *\n\nIn 1982, the same year as his Oscar-nominated soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppolas One From the Heart, Tom Waits produced Swordfishtrombones with Kathleen Brennan. It was the first time Waits had produced his own work. The response from his record company Elektra-Asylum, however, was less than enthusiastic both Waits and the album were dropped, with label president Joe Smith warning with this record you will lose all your old fans and gain no new ones. Smiths successor Bob Krasnow also elected not to release the album or renew Waits recording contract. \n\nA year later, in 1983, Waits signed to Island Records, then one of the worlds leading independent labels. Island rescued the now legendary Swordfishtrombones and released it with new artwork as his first album for the label. \n\nSwordfishtrombones marked a startling new creative point in Waits career with its visceral hybrid of styles and instrumentation. Waits experimented with the sound of his voice, tried unusual recording techniques and utilised found sounds and bizarre textures. His trademark storytelling backed by a piano combo had mutated into impressionistic and surreal aural landscapes. Just at the time in the Eighties when hair and recording got slick and big, Tom Waits offered up lo-fi primitivism, helping to set off a whole new aesthetic that went on to inspire a generation of new artists. \n\nThis period of bold experimentation continued with Rain Dogs (1985) and Franks Wild Years (1987) which, with Swordfishtrombones, formed a landmark trilogy, one of the most accomplished musical achievements of the decade. \n\nThe trilogy was followed by Big Time (1988), a film and soundtrack record of Waits acclaimed 1987 U.S. tour; Bone Machine (1992), which won an American Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and The Black Rider (1993), a recording of the songs and music Waits wrote for director Robert Wilsons award-winning opera, adapted by Beat novelist William Burroughs from an old German folk tale. \n\nSo successful was The Black Rider - Germanys longest-running and most influential stage production of the Eighties - that Robert Wilson later commissioned Waits and his wife and collaborator Kathleen Brennan to compose the songs and music for two further street operas. The first, Alice, based on Lewis Carrolls life and works, premiered in Hamburg at the end of 1992 while the second, Woyzeck (based on the German writer Georg B\u00fcchners nightmarish 19th century play of a cuckolded soldier who murders his girlfriend), opened in Denmark eight years later. The songs from both works later appeared on Alice and Blood Money, the albums Waits released in 2002. \n\n* * *\n\nIn retrospect, it was always inevitable that an artist so steeped in imagery as Tom Waits should be naturally fascinated with the cinema. His first steps in that direction came when he wrote songs for Sylvester Stallones 1978 movie, Paradise Alley, in which Waits also had a cameo appearance. He then wrote and performed two songs for Ralph Waites acclaimed portrait of skid row, On the Nickel (1980), before being entrusted with the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppolas One from the Heart, the directors follow-up to his epic and award-winning Apocalypse Now. \n\nWaits succeeded magnificently. His soundtrack featuring duets with country singer Crystal Gayle - is an enduring classic of American cinema. One from the Heart also won Waits an Academy Award nomination. It was the start of a long association with Coppola, evidenced by Waits appearances as an actor in the directors Rumble Fish, The Outsiders, The Cotton Club and as the unforgettable Renfield in Bram Stokers Dracula. \n\nIn 1986 Waits appeared in Jim Jarmuschs Down by Law, a film that coincidentally marked the international debut of Italian actor Roberto Benigni. That same year Waits made his theatrical stage debut with Franks Wild Years - a musical play he co-wrote with Brennan - at Chicagos Steppenwolf Theatre. \n\nLater film appearances included Ironweed, Queens Logic, The Fisher King, At Play in the Fields of the Lord and another Jarmusch movie, Night on Earth, for which Waits and Brennan composed the score, released as an album in 1991.Waits also had a memorable acting turn in Robert Altmans Short Cuts. \n\nFollowing the release of The Black Rider in 1993, there was to be a six-year hiatus before the next Tom Waits album. In those intervening years, however, he devoted himself to an array of different musical projects. Waits and Brennan, for instance, wrote two songs for the Dead Man Walking soundtrack album at the request of director Tim Robbins. \n\nTom also contributed a song to the Wim Wenders film, The End of Violence while, in 1998, Waits and Brennan composed the score and a song for Bunny, which won the Oscar for Best Short Film (Animated). That same year Tom and Kathleen wrote two songs for Barry Levinsons Liberty Heights film. \n\nAmong other films to which Waits and Brennan have contributed songs are Ed Harriss Pollack, director Arliss Howards Big Bad Love and the Oscar-nominated Shrek 2 while Waits can be seen playing opposite Iggy Pop in Jim Jarmuschs critically acclaimed 2004 film of vignettes, Coffee & Cigarettes. \n\nIn between this film work, Waits also recorded a vocal for Jesus Blood Never Failed Me Yet, the English composer Gavin Bryars remarkable 75-minute orchestral essay. The work centred on a 1971 field recording of a London hobo singing a religious tune; on Bryars album, Waits duets along with the voice of the tramp. \n\n* * *\n\nIn 1999 Tom Waits returned to the limelight with Mule Variations, his first album in six years and his debut for the independent American label, Anti \/ Epitaph. The album, which synthesised Waits affinity for the American song tradition with his love of naturalistic sound worlds, was arguably the most direct and intimate recording of his career. It was certainly the most successful, selling over a million copies around the world and winning a Grammy into the bargain. In the UK it was Waits first-ever Top 10 hit. \n\nAs the follow-up Waits released two separate and distinct albums Alice and Blood Money on the same day in May 2002. The albums were as original as they were different from each other, with Alice chronicling the songs Waits and Brennan had written for Robert Wilsons 1992 theatrical production and Blood Money containing the music commissioned for 2000s Woyzeck. Alices songs are a school of fish that lead the listener into the rapture of the deep. Blood Moneys songs are musical dispatches from the dark, human carnival of life, said Waits, explaining how the two albums differed. \n\nHis rich vein of creativity continued with Real Gone, Waits 2004 album which featured primal blues, rock-steady grooves and Latin rhythms, all mixed and stirred with what Waits called cubist funk and vocal mouth percussion the latter unveiling his unique approach to hip-hop human beatboxing. For the first time in Waits career, there was no piano on the record. \n\nIn between album releases, Waits also returned to the road. A legendary live performer, his appearances are rare, extraordinarily memorable and highly anticipated events. Part distorted vaudeville, part big top, part piano bar and part stand-up, live shows are meticulously orchestrated to have all the grace and excitement of a derailing train, as those lucky enough to have seen his post-Mule tours can testify. In the US, for instance, Waits 2006 summer Orphans tour - the live prelude to the album release - received some of the most extraordinary critical applause of any concert series in the past decade. \n\n* * *\n\nWaits and Brennan were recently named number four in a list of the 100 Best Living Songwriters published by Americas Paste magazine. In literature only a handful of writers have pulled off the near impossible. In music, it happens on every Tom Waits recording, said the magazine. \n\nNamed as one of VH-1s Most Influential Artists of All Time, it is no surprise that Waits body of work has long been covered (and coveted) by other musicians. Notable cover versions include Bruce Springsteen (Jersey Girl); Rod Stewart and Everything But The Girl (Downtown Train); Johnny Cash (Down There By the Train); Marianne Faithfull (Strange Weather); The Ramones (I Dont Wanna Grow Up); 10,000 Maniacs (I Hope I Dont Fall In Love With You); Tim Buckley (Martha); T-Bone Burnett (Time); Bob Seger (Blind Love); Lucinda Williams (Hang Down Your Head); Los Lobos (Jockey Full of Bourbon); Elvis Costello (More Than Rain) and The Blind Boys of Alabama (Jesus Gonna Be Here) as well as Wicked Grin, the critically acclaimed collection of Waits songs recorded by John Hammond and released in 2001. \n\nThere is also a diverse list of artists who have cited Waits as an inspiration, including Bob Dylan who named Tom as one of his secret heroes. The adoration also strikes a chord with a rabid following there is even an annual celebration called Waitstock near Poughkeepsie, New York.

Frank had long labored behind the curtain\u2014writing for Brandy, Justin Bieber, and John Legend\u2014but after hooking up with L.A.'s Odd Future collective, he self-released 2011's nostalgia, ULTRA. mixtape, and his own star quickly rose.

But Frank isn't about accolades and accomplishments. He's a less-is-more kind of guy, the quiet type who saves his words because his songs tell us as much about him as they do ourselves. His live show emphasizes that intimacy, closes that razor-thin gap between the man and his fans.

Born and raised in the infamous Compton, CA armed with nothing but an amateur mixtape and hunger, he built solid local buzz through impressive live shows and an online hustle. Still, a kid with lofty dreams wondered if he\u2019d ever catch that \u201cbig break\u201d. Then one day a conversation at a popular LA sneaker store changed everything.\nIn the aisle of Flight Club LA he and Travis McCoy from Gym Class Heroes had a debate that switched from ranking the greatest Jordans ever to the greatest rappers. \"We started talking about music and I got enough courage to give him my little mixtape\" Tyga says. \"He was telling me all this stuff he was doing with his band and I thought he was just lying to seem cool. Then one day I saw him on MTV, then I started hitting him up on AIM non stop!\" he says with a chuckle.  \"Next thing you know I'm on tour with him going all over the world. It was crazy.\" Travis relates \u201cI can see myself at his age whenever I watch him perform. It\u2019s an innocence and a sense of urgency a lot of artists today lack and it\u2019s an honor for me to welcome him to the inner circle\u201d. Travis signed Tyga to his Bat Squad Records imprint. A bond had been made indeed.\n\nTyga soon became an unofficial part of Gym Class Hero\u2019s crew and his undeniable presence would be felt at various events, appearances and shows. People began to wonder \u201cwho is this kid?\u201d His charismatic swagger gave off the aura of a star while he patiently waited for his real chance to shine. \n\nThat moment came at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. The night before the show Tyga found out that he would be perform the \"Arms Race\" remix with Fall Out Boy alongside Travis and Lil Wayne. Unexpectedly thrust into such a huge arena, most young artists would crumble under the pressure. Instead, Tyga stepped up and traded vocal jabs on a stage full of pop-culture heavyweights in front of millions of viewers. The star had arrived.\n\nThoroughly impressed by the youngster's gusto, Tyga and Weezy became fast friends. Wayne remembers \u201cAt rehearsal I thought he was just a stand in, but when the cameras were rolling I realized he wasn\u2019t playing around\u201d. Soon, Tyga would find himself in the studio with the self-proclaimed \"greatest rapper alive\" laying down verses for an appearance on the most anticipated album in years - Lil Wayne's The Carter 3. \n\nAnother famous musician known for his ability to spot talent - Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz also took notice. He was so excited he suggested his label Decaydance team up with Bat Squad on a release for Tyga. \u201cGym Class\u2019 success has opened a lot of new doors for us, \u201c Pete says \u201cYeah, it\u2019s different but I think it\u2019d be pretty lame if I only put out stuff that I thought everybody loves or gets. To me this is the future.\u201d\n\nThe press has also taken notice with early mentions in Blender, AOL.com and MTV. VIBE magazine even declared him as one of the best undiscovered rappers in America. The fact that momentum has started rolling in Tyga\u2019s favor has not been lost on the humble artist. \u201cI truly am blessed to have such great people believing in me. I\u2019m real lucky and I can\u2019t wait to get out there and make everyone proud. I just gotta stay positive, keep my faith in God and I know things will turn out great\u201d \n\nTyga\u2019s aptly titled debut album NO INTRODUCTION is set for release this spring. The lead single -  \u201cCoconut Juice\u201d - produced by SAM & Sluggo (Gym Class Heroes, Method Man) is a track just screaming to take over radio. Tyga explains the meaning behind the unusual phrase \u201cI don\u2019t drink alcohol, so at parties I would just walk around with a cup mixed with whatever else I could find. When people asked what I was sipping on I would say \u2018coconut juice\u2019 because it sounded funny.

{"about":"http:\/\/3OH3music.com - Get the new album OMENS now: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/OMENS ","artists_we_like":"seal, kelly clarkson","band_interests":"stealing","band_members":"Sean Foreman\nNathaniel Motte","bio":"3OH!3 doesn't like to brag. Sean Foreman and Nathaniel 'Nat' Motte say that making their loud, distorted, electronic-pop music is not about the trophies and notoriety. No, forming 3OH!3 (named after the duo's area code in Boulder, Colorado) was always about something larger than themselves. It was and remains about being FUN!\n\nIf we go back to the beginning, we can find Sean in his parents basement, clicking incessantly on his mouse for 'friend-requests' on 3OH!3's sparkling new MySpace page. Meanwhile, across town, Nat is working on earth-shattering beats, hunched over his computer, in what he charmingly referred to as his 'dungeon' apartment. There, in a pair of blown-out computer speakers, Nat brought to life what the world currently knows as 3OH!3. Those sounds and songs became the band's 2007 self-released album, which were handed off across the states until they fell through the mail slot at Photo Finish Records and into the hands of label president Matt Galle.\n\nBlown away by Sean and Nat's visionary production and clever lyrics, Galle immediately flew the boys into scenic Beltsville, Maryland, to record with the brilliant producer Matt Squire. Feeling at home in the studio, Sean and Nat worked day and night, piecing together their 2008 success, Want. With the help of their furry little producer friend Benny Blanco, 3OH!3's first single, \"Don't Trust Me,\" crawled slowly up the charts for 15 months to attain a No. 1 spot at pop radio, going double platinum and selling over 2.6 million tracks in the process.\n\n3OH!3 hates to brag, but if they had to they would tell you that they were nominated for \"Best New Artist\" alongside Lady Gaga, Kid Cudi, and Drake, at the 2009 Video Music Awards. Though they didn't bring home the moon man, Nat and Sean had just as much fun performing \"Don't Trust Me\" in Radio City's hallowed halls. Nat was actually happy 3OH!3 wasn't announced best new artist as he claims he would have peed his pants, having not been able to find a bathroom all night. \"Drinks impair the ol' judgment,\" he says.\n\nThese two guys are no strangers to national television either. Appearing multiple times on late night TV (Jimmy Kimmel Live and Last Call with Carson Daly) and alongside the glittery Ke$ha on American Idol, 3OH!3's learned a few things about working the camera.\n\nI know 3OH!3 would never say this, but they are one of the best live acts in the business. Their dedication to putting on an epic and fun show every night was rewarded by a nomination for the 2009 MTV Woodies' Performance Award alongside artists like Green Day, Animal Collective and Phoenix. These boys sell out shows from the rainy streets of London to the Gold Coast of Australia, where, by no coincidence, their songs have gone gold and platinum and continue to sell by the thousands. It's no wonder that 3OH!3 has been invited to play legendary festivals like Reading and Leads and Warped Tour again and again.\n\nWith such a non-stop touring schedule, it must have been a real relief to retreat to their mountain sanctuary in Breckenridge in January to record their next album. In a snowy cabin, far above the world, Sean and Nat went a little crazy, writing as many as two new songs a day for 14 days. \"We had all these songs built up over the past couple years,\" Sean says, \"and it was like a mental vomit of all the stuff we had been thinking.\" This was not gross-tasting vomit, however, this was like roses and gold and everything nice, finally let loose on the world. Before things got weird in the mountains, the boys packed up their gear and headed out to LA to start recording the album that would be known as Streets of Gold.\n\nBack in the studio with the usual suspects Matt Squire and Benny Blanco, 3OH!3 took all they had learned from touring and experience and put it to use. \"There are some crazy sounds on this record,\" Nat says, \"It sounds like robots making love.\" Nothing says love like their first single off the record, \"My First Kiss\" featuring Ke$ha. \"It was like our first kiss with Ke$ha,\" Nat says, \"It was the first time we met her and she definitely used tongue.\" Within a few hours of being released on iTunes, \"My First Kiss\" jumped to the no. 2 on the overall song chart.\n\n3OH!3 was very selective when it came to collaborating on Streets of Gold. Having greatly admired his work with Lily Allen and The Bird and the Bee, 3OH!3 sought out producer Greg Kurstin for their own music. \"I think Greg has attained a perfect synthesis of electronic and organic music in his work, and he was someone whom I really, really wanted to work with and learn from.\" Additionally 3OH!3 teamed with Benny Blanco's mentor, hit-smith Dr. Luke on \"My First Kiss\" and \"Streets of Gold\" (the title track to the record). With help from those production Titans, it's a safe to say a few more songs off the album might lend \"My First Kiss\" some company at the top of the charts.\n\nStreets of Gold is the album that 3OH!3 has been struggling to create for their whole musical lives. Showing a wide range of tastes\u2014from the car rattling battle raps of \"I Can Do Anything\" to the post-apocalyptic love ballad \"Love 2012\" to the throwback casbah sounds of \"I Know How to Say\"\u20143OH!3 has evolved into a super-human machine. With Nat's surgical precision (Nat was destined to be a doctor after all, and has been deferring his acceptance to medical school for a few years) and Sean's one-two punch lines, every song is bound to be permanently engrained in your head. \"We try to make music that is fun and comes across live,\" says Sean. \"This album is epic,\" says Nat, \"it has a little piece of everything we like and do. We write and co-produce all our own music, and it was so satisfying to apply all that we learned in the past couple of years.\"\n\nOn the road again, 3OH!3 is testing out the new tracks and making more friends. \"We've played some of the new songs without a single fan knowing the lyrics,\" says Nat, \"And people are going fucking BANANAS. It's a great sign!\" There are many great signs for 3OH!3 as they take their journey on their own street of gold. Nat, as a writer and producer, has been working with other artists. Sean is keeping busy with his own cowrites\u2014including Ke$ha's platinum selling \"Blah Blah Blah\"\u2014and as a result was named the #9 Hit Songwriter in the UK by Music Week. The future is looking bright for these two Boulder boys.\n\nNathaniel Motte and Sean Foreman are two very busy guys. If they aren't filming mini-movies for the deluxe package of Streets of Gold, drawing comic books, or modeling (yes, they are Ford models), they are spending time with their friends or getting outdoors. Sean was crazy enough to sign up for the Chicago Marathon in October, running it to raise money for the American Cancer Society. And Nat is crazy enough to continue his deferral from Medical School at the University of Colorado. What does the future have in store for 3OH!3? \"We're going to JAPAN!!!\" Nat answers.\n\nWell, that might be true, but I have a feeling we will be seeing a lot more from 3OH!3 and then they will have a hell of a lot more to not brag about.\n\nWritten by Sean Foreman ","booking_agent":"gabrielapodaca\u0040theagencygroup.com","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Mike Kaminsky","hometown":"Boulder, CO","influences":"seal","is_published":true,"record_label":"Photo Finish Records","talking_about_count":4887,"username":"3oh3music","website":"www.3oh3music.com www.myspace.com\/3oh3 www.twitter.com\/3oh3 www.twitter.com\/NAT3OH3 www.twitter.com\/kidquizine","were_here_count":0,"id":"31342311778","name":"3OH!3","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/3oh3music","likes":5325228,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151888724521779","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1208945_10151888724521779_1008667936_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Legendary Motown artist, American icon and musical genius.\nwww.itunes.com\/motown\n","bio":"Dubbed \u201cLittle Stevie Wonder\u201d by Motown\u2019s Berry Gordy, he was signed to the label when he was only 12 years old and was just 13 when the live recording \u201cFingertips (Part 2)\u201d hit no. 1 pop and R&B. Playing harmonica, drums and keyboards, as well as singing, the boy who had been blind from infancy proved aptly named. While still a teenager--dropping the \u201cLittle\u201d from his stage name--he earned seven top 10 pop singles, including \u201cFor Once In My Life,\u201d \u201cMy Cherie Amour,\u201d \u201cYester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday,\u201d \u201cUptight (Everything\u2019s Alright)\u201d and \u201cI Was Made To Love Her.\u201d \nBy age 20, he was self-sufficient in the studio, writing, playing every instrument and serving as his own producer, including for such hits as \u201cSigned, Sealed, Delivered I\u2019m Yours\u201d and \u201cIf You Really Love Me.\u201d He broadened his vision from pure pop to the socially conscious. He began exploring exotic musical ideas incorporating gospel, rock, jazz, reggae, and African and Latin American rhythms, and pioneered the use of synthesizers.\nTurning 21 in 1971, Stevie holed up in a New York studio and refused to sign with Motown until he was given autonomy to record as he please. Motown agreed and the groundbreaking Music Of My Mind was released followed the next year. Later that year came Talking Book, which boasted the no. 1 pop and R&B hits \u201cSuperstition\u201d and \u201cYou Are The Sunshine Of My Life.\u201d Innervisions, featuring the Top 10 hit \u201cHigher Ground,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t You Worry \u2019Bout A Thing\u201d and the epic \u201cLiving For The City,\u201d was a landmark LP that became the his first of three consecutive Grammy\u00ae Albums of the Year. \nWhile the record was riding high, Wonder was in a near-fatal accident. He recovered to record another deeply felt album, Fulfillingness\u2019 First Finale, in 1974, that featured the no. 1 pop \u201cYou Haven\u2019t Done Nothin\u2019\u201d (with the Jackson 5 on background vocals) and no. 1 R&B \u201cBoogie On Reggae Woman.\u201d \nSongs In The Key Of Life was an instant no. 1 album, the first by an American artist to debut at the top spot, where it remained for an incredible 14 weeks. It was highlighted by the no. 1 pop and R&B hits \u201cI Wish\u201d and \u201cSir Duke.\u201d By the late seventies, Wonder was also leading the way in New Age instrumental music with the soundtrack album Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants, which featured the ballad hit \u201cSend One Your Love.\u201d He won 15 Grammys in just four years.\nWonder kicked off the eighties with his funk classic \u201cMaster Blaster (Jammin\u2019),\u201d a tribute to Bob Marley, and \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d the theme song for the successful campaign to establish the birthday of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a national holiday. Both were included on the album Hotter Than July. Balancing public causes and private emotion, he scored with the no. 1 R&B \u201cThat Girl\u201d in 1982. A champion of racial harmony, he joined Paul McCartney on the no. 1 pop \u201cEbony And Ivory\u201d later that year. \nWonder contributed songs to the Gene Wilder film The Woman In Red in 1984, when the theme song, \u201cI Just Called To Say I Love You,\u201d hit no. 1 pop, R&B and adult contemporary. It also became Wonder\u2019s first no. 1 in the U.K. With Elton John and Gladys Knight, he also appeared on Dionne Warwick\u2019s 1985 no. 1 pop \u201cThat\u2019s What Friends Are For,\u201d which benefited AIDS research. That same year, he won the Oscar\u00ae for Best Song for \u201cI Just Called To Say I Love You\u201d; was spotlighted in \u201cWe Are The World,\u201d the landmark charity effort for African famine relief; and \u201cPart-Time Lover,\u201d from the album In Square Circle, became the first single to simultaneously top the pop, R&B, adult contemporary and dance\/disco charts. \nThe nineties and the new millennium were marked by collaborations with artists as diverse as Prince and Sting, Babyface and Busta Rhymes, Snoop Dogg and Andrea Bocelli, Sting and Tony Bennett, and projects as varied as the Broadway musical Rent and Spike Lee\u2019s film Jungle Fever. \nWonder was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. As of mid-2008, Wonder has earned 25 solo Top 10 pop hits, among them seven no. 1\u2019s, and won 22 Grammy Awards--plus a prestigious Lifetime Achievement Grammy in 1996. His 2005 Motown album A Time 2 Love garnered six Grammy nominations and won two, including one for \u201cSo Amazing,\u201d Wonder\u2019s duet with Beyonce. .\nFor Rolling Stone magazine\u2019s 2004 article \u201cThe Immortals \u2013 The Greatest Artists Of All Time,\u201d Elton John wrote about Stevie Wonder: \u201cWhen he comes into a room, people adore him. And there aren\u2019t many artists like that. People admire you and they like your records, but they don\u2019t want to stand up and hug you. But this man is a good man. He tries to use his music to do good. His message, I think, is about love, and in the world we live in today, that message does shine through.\u201d\n","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"R&B Soul","hometown":"Saginaw, MI","is_published":true,"record_label":"Motown","talking_about_count":30462,"username":"StevieWonder","website":"http:\/\/www.steviewonderliveatlast.com\/ http:\/\/www.steviewonder.net http:\/\/classic.motown.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"10155847541","name":"Stevie Wonder","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/StevieWonder","likes":4015208,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150900658652542","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/548644_10150900658652542_1913089883_n.jpg","offset_y":16,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"yoooohooooo go buy HARD OUT HERE: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/HardOutHere?IQid=facebook www.twitter.com\/lilyallen","band_members":"Lily Allen","bio":"Pop sensation. Voice of her generation. Fashion designer. Political activist. Mouthy blogshite. X-rated sexpert. Fall-down drunk. WAG-tagoniser. Queen of MySpace. Exhibitionist. Primadonna. Style icon. Celebrity girlfriend. Celebrity daughter. Celebrity sister. Paparazzi prey. Party starter. Princess.\n\nLily Allen has been called all these things, and much, much more - sometimes with justification, often without. She\u2019s posh, she\u2019s common, she\u2019s sexy, she\u2019s demure, she\u2019s reticent, she\u2019s outspoken, she\u2019s sensitive, she\u2019s shameless, she\u2019s loved-up, she\u2019s distraught, often all in the same evening. Then she goes to bed, gets up and has breakfast. Then she posts her breakfast on the Internet. Then other people analyse her breakfast. And wonder why she posted it on the Internet.\n\nContrary, contradictory, occasionally catty, always compelling, Allen, at 23, is Britain\u2019s most consistently engaged and engaging pop star, as well as one of our most successful.\n\nShe first commandeered the public stage in July 2006, a fully formed phenomenon with a song that would help define that summer, the hugely infectious \u201cSmile\u201d, her first CD single and her first UK number one. \u201cSmile\u201d served as an excellent primer for the Allen oeuvre, a breezy, lilting, ska-inflected slice of perfect pop distinguished by sugar-sweet vocals and unflinchingly autobiographical lyrics. It was a song of female empowerment sung by a smart-mouthed, wide-eyed, pretty post-teen in a pink prom dress and box-fresh Nike trainers, fluoro make-up and huge hoop earrings.\n\n\u201cLDN\u201d was, if anything, even more insidious and distinctive: a faux-na\u00efve, text-spelt, profane paean to the city of her birth in all its grimy glory. \n\nBy the time of the release of \u201cAlright, Still\u201d, her debut album, Allen\u2019s stardom was solidified and her public persona cemented: cheeky, waspish, searingly honest, sparky, spiky and satirical. Some of the stories about her were even true.\n\nLily Allen was born in May 1985 in Hammersmith, west London, the daughter of film producer Alison Owen and actor Keith Allen. It was an unconventional childhood, but not one without its compensations, and it made Allen wise beyond her years and tremendously motivated to carve her own place in the world. Raised alongside her sister and brother in Bloomsbury, Shepherd\u2019s Bush, Primrose Hill and Islington, she attended 13 different schools in total before abandoning her formal education at 15 and embarking on a teenage odyssey of innocence and experience: clubbing in Ibiza, studying to be a florist, always hoping to break into the entertainment industry.\n\nShe knocked on record company doors from the age of 16, and her first deal came in 2002, with Warners, who pushed her in an uncomfortably folky direction. It was two years later, working with producers Future Cut, when Allen began to find her feet as a songwriter. In 2005 she signed to Regal, an imprint of Parlophone, and, frustrated by the slow pace of the music industry, began to post demos on her MySpace page. Meanwhile, a series of live appearances at the Notting Hill nightclub Yo-Yo in the spring of 2006 whetted press and public appetites.\n\nMeanwhile, Allen provided guest vocals on songs by Robbie Williams, Dizzee Rascal and Basement Jaxx, among others, and made a specialty of unexpected cover versions. As well as her hit interpretation of the Kaiser Chiefs\u2019 \u201cOh My God\u201d alongside Ronson, she has covered The Kooks, The Pretenders and Blondie, and offered a sardonic reworking of 50 Cent\u2019s \u201cWindow Shopper\u201d.\n\nThose people will be interested to learn that \u201cIt\u2019s Not Me, It\u2019s You\u201d might be the only album they\u2019ll hear in 2009 that references racism (\u201cFuck You\u201d); ageism (\u201c22\u201d); the dark side of celebrity and consumer culture (\u201cThe Fear\u201d); drug dependency (\u201cEveryone\u2019s At It\u201d); and 9\/11 (\u201cHim\u201d); but also TV dinners (\u201cChinese\u201d); premature ejaculation (\u201cNot Fair\u201d); the enduring rubbishness of men (\u201cNever Gonna Happen\u201d), as well as the fragile beauty of early romance (\u201cWho\u2019d Have Known\u201d).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Not Me, It\u2019s You\u201d is unmistakably Her: bracing home truths and pungent social commentary delivered in the voice of an angel. It\u2019s a potent combination. It could only be Lily Allen. \n\n\nThe album \u201cIt\u2019s Not Me, It\u2019s You\u201d released February 9th\nThe single \u201cThe Fear\u201d released January 26th.\n","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Alternative Pop","hometown":"LDN","influences":"Blondie , The Specials , Zinc , SL2 , Futurecut Productions, Baby D , Dizzee Rascal, Newham Generals, sCISSOR sISTESRS , Chas n Dave , Jamie T , Ragga Twins , Beenie Man , Pay as you go Cartel ,Lee Dorsey , Happy Mondays , Black Grape, T REX (possibly the best band ever , ever ! ) ,Kris Kross, Ben Parmar , Kate Bush( when she was my age) , Wreckless Eric","is_published":true,"record_label":"Parlophone","talking_about_count":84476,"username":"lilyallen","website":"www.lilyallenmusic.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"5202024322","name":"Lily Allen","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lilyallen","likes":3049011,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152006936669323","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1457640_10152006936669323_946287888_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":20}}

{"about":"STOICville.\n\"Up Down\" (Do This All Day) featuring B.o.B is now available on iTunes.  http:\/\/smarturl.it\/UpDown","artists_we_like":"Joey Galaxy aka Young Cash, Tay Dizm, One Chance, Field Mob, Shawnna","band_members":"T-Pain","bio":"Few people can accurately say they\u2019ve changed the course of music; count T-Pain among that short list.  His bright, polished arrangements have become the in-demand sound across genres, and his scene-stealing vocal performances are among the most coveted in music. Since bursting on the scene in 2005, T-Pain has been awarded a Grammy, produced and written a plethora of chart-topping and platinum-selling singles, garnered \"Songwriter of the Year\" and \"Producer of the Year\" honors at the BMI Urban Awards and earned a BET Award. So it should come as little surprise that the musical maestro\u2019s tremendous, self-produced third album, THR33 RINGZ, stands as a sonic odyssey brimming with innovation.\n\nThe distinctive spelling used for the album title may not hold any significance, but the meaning behind the name carries weight.  \u201cIt came from people telling me that I\u2019m running the game, that I\u2019m the ringleader of the game,\u201d T-Pain says humbly. \u201cThat\u2019s where the whole circus imagery came from. I started putting it together with the idea that the circus is just like the music industry. You\u2019ve got your different acts, all of the different animals, etc.\u201d\n\nTHR33 RINGZ is quite the musical journey, complete with highs and lows, smash singles and unexpected twists. Lead single \u201cCan\u2019t Believe It\u201d is already enjoying heavy radio and video exposure.  Aided by sprinkly keys and T-Pain\u2019s trademark vocoder, he and guest Lil Wayne talk about spoiling their respective ladies in the song. There\u2019s good reason T-Pain\u2019s music often connects with and speaks to women.  He had plenty of training dealing with the fairer sex.  \n\n\u201cWhen I was in school, I would sit and talk to a lot of girls,\u201d T-Pain recalls. \u201cI would listen to what they would talk about, what they want. I would try to understand the passions of a woman. That\u2019s where my concepts come from. That\u2019s how you know if people can relate to your songs.  If you\u2019ve heard the same elements of a story over and over again, you know there are millions of people going through this.\u201d  \n\nSince his schoolroom listening sessions, T-Pain has kept his ears open. In fact, listening to several sob stories inspired \u201cTherapy,\u201d a tune where T-Pain and Kanye West talk about women who need to get themselves together. T-Pain then details relationships with negative energy on \u201cChopped & Screwed\u201d a track that features Ludacris. But T-Pain\u2019s music isn\u2019t all about drama. He also listens to his friends when they gush about a special someone. The party track \u201cFreeze,\u201d for instance, grew out of conversation T-Pain had with Chris Brown.  Brown, who also appears on the high-energy song, was telling T-Pain how he finds women that can dance particularly attractive.  \n\nOf course T-Pain\u2019s long-time fans know that he especially appreciates women who dance in strip clubs.  But he knows from first-hand experience how men often fall victim to DJs who switch songs up too quickly when they\u2019ve just paid for a lap dance. Hence, the five-minute plus \u201cLong Lap Dance.\u201d  \u201cIn Florida, strippers charge for lap dances by the song,\u201d T-Pain explains. \n\u201cIf you just so happen to ask a girl for a lap dance in the middle of a song and the DJ cuts it off, you still have to pay the full price.  So I just made a long song, so whenever you ask for it, you should be good.  And the DJs know that they can\u2019t cut it off, \u2018cause then it wouldn\u2019t be the \u2018Long Lap Dance\u2019 song.\u201d\n\nWith his music being largely based on real-world encounters, it makes sense that T-Pain recorded \u201cReality Show,\u201d a tune that details some of his wild experiences.  \u201cAt certain times, everybody\u2019s like, \u2018I need my own reality show because the stuff I\u2019m going through is crazy,\u2019\u201d T-Pain says with a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want the world to see everything you\u2019re going through, but nobody\u2019s done a reality show song yet.\u201d\n\nReality shows are filled with drama, and T-Pain\u2019s existence is no different.  When he gets angry, T-Pain is likely to end up rapping, as is the case on \u201cRing Leader Man,\u201d \u201cKaraoke\u201d with DJ Khaled and the title track.  \u201cIf I\u2019m upset, then it\u2019s going to be a rap day,\u201d T-Pain says with a chuckle. \u201cI make music depending on what mood I\u2019m in.  If I\u2019m pissed off, I can\u2019t get on there and talk about love.\u201d\n\nEven though T-Pain sometimes finds himself in an angry mood, he remains grounded because of his wife and children. His family is also the inspiration for THR33 RINGZ song \u201cKeep Going.\u201d This acoustic tune stands as a testament to T-Pain\u2019s dedication to his family. \u201cI want to make sure that my kids live a good life,\u201d he says.  \u201cI don\u2019t want them to have to figure out the hard way what a food stamp is. I\u2019ve slept in cars.  I went through a lot in my life and I\u2019m going to make sure that if somebody\u2019s life is in my hands that they\u2019re not going to have to go through that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, T-Pain can speak from that perspective because he knows what it is like to struggle. His Tallahassee, Florida hometown was lacking music industry opportunities and connections, so the man born Faheem Najm chose the T-Pain moniker to signify his plight.  He taught himself how to make music, write songs and record music.  \n\nIn 2003, T-Pain\u2019s sly remake of Akon\u2019s \u201cLocked Up\u201d caught the attention of music industry insiders, and the independent release of his \u201cI\u2019m Sprung\u201d single led to a contract with Zomba Recordings.\n\nT-Pain\u2019s use of the vocoder made his music stand out, and his prolific, high-quality output turned him into one of music\u2019s most oft-imitated and in-demand producers, singers and collaborators.  His first two albums, 2006\u2019s Rappa Ternt Sanga and 2007\u2019s Epiphany, have been certified gold, thanks to hit singles such as \u201cI\u2019m N Luv (Wit A Stripper)\u201d and \u201cBuy U A Drank (Shawty Snappin\u2019).\u201d  He has also collaborated with Kanye West (Good Life), Chris Brown (\u201cKiss Kiss\u201d) Flo Rida (Low) Plies (Shawty) and Bow Wow (\u201cOutta My System\u201d) for platinum singles.\n\nNow, as T-Pain gains more control over his artistry, expect him to continue expanding his sonic and creative reach as a singer-songwriter-rapper-producer.  After all, he knows the key to long-term success in the music industry is evolution.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be different and keep it consistent at the same time, which is super-hard to do,\u201d T-Pain says.  \u201cI come different every time and that\u2019s what people look for, what they expect.\u201d\n\nAnd with THR33 RINGZ, the world expects nothing less than another magical musical adventure from T-Pain.  Expectation achieved.","booking_agent":"Matt Galle - Paradigm Agency Mgalle\u0040paradigmagency.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"ATL, Worldwide","description":"http:\/\/www.nappyboyonline.com\nhttp:\/\/www.t-pain.com\nhttp:\/\/twitter.com\/TPain\nhttp:\/\/instagram.com\/tpain\nhttp:\/\/IAmT-Pain.com\nhttp:\/\/www.izotope.com\/products\/audio\/tpaineffect\/\nhttp:\/\/www.IAmT-PainMic.com","general_manager":"Chase Entertainment","genre":"R&B \/ Hip Hop","hometown":"Tallahassee, Florida","influences":"Cee Lo, Roger Troutman, Teddy Riley","is_published":true,"press_contact":"RCA Records","record_label":"Nappy Boy \/ Konvict \/ RCA","talking_about_count":107250,"username":"t-pain","website":"http:\/\/www.nappyboyonline.com http:\/\/www.t-pain.com http:\/\/twitter.com\/TPain http:\/\/instagram.com\/tpain http:\/\/IAmT-Pain.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"6751601388","name":"T-Pain","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/t-pain","likes":10097113,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151521300046389","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/557988_10151521300046389_507455605_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"2009-2013","band_members":"Hance Alligood -Vocals-\nDoriano Magliano -Vocals-\nKevin Hanson -Guitar-\nAndrew Paiano -Guitar-\nBrian Medley -Bass-\nDavid Angle -Drums-","bio":"When somebody stabs you in the back, don\u2019t turnaround and do the same thing. Go directly for the face. Confront your enemies, stand up for yourself and fight through adversity: literally, figuratively and every way in between. When it comes to creating art, don\u2019t hold back. Put it all out on the table.\n\nThat\u2019s the message of Woe, Is Me, whose personal story of triumph through shared struggle blazes a shining pathway for their fans to follow. And it\u2019s a point-of-view delivered through an engaging live show where crowd-participation is a must.\n\nIn Woe, Is Me, the sludgy, aggressive bottom end of vintage nu-metal collides with modern breakdowns and electronics-enhanced atmosphere, alongside the melodic sing-a-long anthem style of A Day To Remember and the arresting emotional ferocity of screamo standard-bearers like The Used and My Chemical Romance; all with a powerful new twist. When a fan asked the band on Twitter to describe their jaw-dropping and brutal yet deliciously poppy and inspiring album Genesi[s] in just five words, their reply was simply this: \u201cReally fucking catchy and heavy.\u201d\n\nAfter a lineup shakeup that would have decimated lesser bands, the Atlanta-bred six-piece has risen like a phoenix from the ashes with their sophomore-slump-killing new album, Genesi[s]. Woe, Is Me\u2019s second offering is truly a rebirth. It\u2019s the beginning of something new, something of vital importance to the modern music scene that carries with it a message of consequence.\n\nThe band silences all doubters with these words, from \u201cA Story to Tell\u201d: \u201cYou don\u2019t have the backbone that everyone believes you do\/ so talk your shit \/ I\u2019ll give you a reason to.\u201d\n\nGenesi[s] tracks like \u201cNothing Left to Lose,\u201d \u201cI Told You Once\u201d and \u201cFamily First\u201d have taken the blueprint laid down with 2010\u2019s Number[s], blown it to pieces and rebuilt it stronger than before, ushering in an even bolder, in-your-face sound filled with musical confidence and bravado.\n\nWoe, Is Me features two incredible singers whose versatility and power add dynamic dimensions. \u201cThis is exactly where I\u2019m meant to be,\u201d Hance Alligood declares in \u201cCall it Like I See It,\u201d decisively speaking for the entire band. \u201cThere\u2019s not a chance in hell that you can take this from me.\u201d\nThe fans first got a taste of Alligood when \u201cVengeance\u201d hit iTunes in the fall of 2011. He has a melodic croon that could melt radio dials just as assuredly as co-voalist Doriano Magliano\u2019s growl gives death metal\u2019s finest a run for their money. The pair joins Woe, Is Me founding members Kevin Hanson (guitar) and Austin Thornton (drums) as part of a reconfigured lineup that is primed and ready for battle against the forces of mediocrity and repetition overcrowding the scene. Brian Medley (bass), Andew Paiano (guitars) and the rest of the band honed their craft on the road, analyzing and emphasizing their strongest elements together.\n\n\u201cOur music is what it sounds like to kick someone\u2019s ass but to have fun while you\u2019re doing it,\u201d Thornton says proudly. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot of crap and we\u2019re trying to show kids that you can triumph if you persevere.\u201d The band recognized the basic components of songs from bands like New Found Glory and grabbed a hold of what made them smile. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why you turn on certain music in your car and when you\u2019re hanging out with your friends,\u201d notes the drummer. \u201cThat\u2019s something our music lacked a little bit. We were tired of that. So our new music is heavy as hell, the heaviest we\u2019ve written, but also the most catchy and melodic.\u201d\n\nMore than ever, Woe, Is Me is focused on the big picture. They are aware of the power of insightful lyrics delivered with catchy melodies, the way that music can shape and take hold of someone\u2019s experiences in a positive or sometimes negative way. \u201cWhat we say can truly affect someone\u2019s life,\u201d Alligood notes with humility. Part of that impact on their listeners lives involves empowering them with forceful words of strength. \u201cThere were songs that would help me through anything from a breakup to something with my parents,\u201d the singer adds.\n\nWoe, Is Me works hard to craft the type of songs that will connect with people in deep and meaningful ways; the type of songs found all over Genesi[s]. When the band looks out in the crowd and sees people screaming the words back at them, they know they\u2019ve accomplished something bigger than themselves.\n","booking_agent":"Dave Shapiro- daveshapiro\u0040theagencygroup.com [US] & Tom Taaffe- tomtaaffe\u0040theagencygroup.com [EUR]","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Atlanta, GA","general_manager":"Mike Mowery & Adam Mott | Outerloop Management ","genre":"Rock","hometown":"Atlanta, Ga","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Mike Cubillos- Mike\u0040EarshotMedia.com","record_label":"Velocity\/Rise Records","talking_about_count":1815,"username":"woeis","website":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/woeis http:\/\/youtube.com\/woeistv ","were_here_count":0,"id":"332651311796","name":"Woe, Is Me","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/woeis","likes":675202,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151893897601797","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash4\/s720x720\/1380048_10151893897601797_1342115768_n.jpg","offset_y":100,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Bring Me Home Live DVD out now. Order here http:\/\/smarturl.it\/SaBMHPLFB","bio":"Soldier of Love is only the sixth studio album the band Sade have released during their 25 year career, and the first since Lover's Rock in 2000. For Sade herself, as the lynchpin of the group's songwriting effort, it's a simple matter of integrity and authenticity. \u201cI only make records when I feel I have something to say. I'm not interested in releasing music just for the sake of selling something. Sade is not a brand.\u201d\n\nThe call went out in 2008 for the group to re-convene at Peter Gabriel's Real World studio, near Sade's home in the countryside of south west England.   It was the first time the four principals had met up since the Lover's Rock tour wrapped in 2001. Bassist Paul Denman de-camped from Los Angeles, where he had been managing his teenage son's punk band, Orange. Guitarist and sax player Stuart Matthewman interrupted his film soundtrack work in New York, and keyboardist Andrew Hale gave up his A&R consultancy.\n\nIn a series of fortnightly sessions at Real World, Sade sketched out the material for a new album which, they all felt, was probably their most ambitious to date. In particular, the sonic layering and martial beats of the title track, Soldier Of Love, sounded quite different from anything they had previously recorded. According to Andrew Hale:  \u201cThe big question for all of us at the beginning was, did we still want to do this and could we still get along as friends?\u201d The answer soon came back as a passionate affirmative.\n\nThe album was completed in the summer of 2009, mainly at Real World. The feel of the music this time had moved away from the old country soul styling of Lover's Rock and assumed a more eclectic identity. At times the band sounded like the original Sade, with Matthewman back blowing soft sax on In Another Time and the vocal on Long Hard Road hymning. But with songs such as the joyously quirky reggae chant Babyfather, and the dramatically arranged album opener The Moon and the Sky, Sade were exploring new territory. \u201cI never want to repeat myself,\u201d Sade herself says. \u201cAnd that becomes a more interesting challenge for us the longer we carry on together.\u201d\n\nHelen Folasade Adu was born in Ibadan, Nigeria. Her father was Nigerian, a university teacher of economics; her mother Anne was an English nurse. The couple met in London while he was studying at the LSE and moved to Nigeria shortly after getting married. When their daughter was born, nobody locally was prepared to call her by her English name, and a shortened version of Folasade stuck. Then, when she was four, her parents separated, and her mother brought Sade and her elder brother Banji back to England, where they initially lived with their grandparents just outside Colchester, Essex.\n\nShe listened to American soul music, particularly the wave led in the 1970's by artists such as Curtis Mayfield, Donny Hathaway, and Bill Withers. As a teenager, she saw the Jackson 5 at the Rainbow theatre in Finsbury Park, where she worked behind the bar at weekends. \"I was more fascinated by the audience than by anything that was going on on the stage. They'd attracted kids, mothers with children, old people, white, black. I was really moved. That's the audience I've always aimed for.\"\n\nMusic was not her first choice as a career. She studied fashion at St Martin's School Of Art and only began singing after two old school friends with a fledgling group approached her to help them out with the vocals.\n\nSomewhat to her surprise, she found that while the singing made her nervous, she enjoyed writing songs. Two years later she had overcome her stage fright and was regularly singing back up with a North London Latin funk band called Pride. \"I used to get on stage with Pride, like, shaking. I was terrified. But I was determined to try my best, and I decided that if I was going to sing, I would sing the way I speak, because it's important to be yourself.\"\n\nSade served a long apprenticeship on the road with Pride. Pride's shows featured a segment in which Sade fronted a quartet that played quieter, jazzier numbers. One of these, a song called Smooth Operator, which Sade had co-written herself, attracted the attention of record company talent scouts. Soon, everybody wanted to sign her, but not the rest of Pride. Obstinately loyal to her friends in the group, Sade refused to depart. 18 months later she relented and signed to Epic records - on condition that she took with her the three band mates who still comprise the entity known as Sade: saxophonist Stuart Matthewman, keyboard player Andrew Hale, and bassist Paul Denman.\n\nSade's first single, Your Love Is King, became a top 10 British hit in February 1984, and with that her life,  and that of the band, changed forever. The unstressed, understated elegance of the music in conjunction with her look - unspecifically exotic and effortlessly sophisticated \u2013 launched Sade as the female face of the style decade. Magazines queued to put her on the cover. \"It wasn't marketing,\" she says, wearily. \"It was just me. And I wasn't trying to promote an image.\"\n\nAt the time of her first album, Diamond Life, her actual life was anything but diamond-like. Sade was living in a converted fire station in Finsbury Park with her then boyfriend, the style journalist Robert Elms. There was no heating, which meant that she had to get dressed in bed. The loo, which used to ice over in winter, was on the fire escape. The bath was in the kitchen. \"We were freezing, basically.\" For the remainder of the 1980's, as the first three albums sold by the million around the world, Sade toured more or less constantly. For her this remains a point of principle. \u201cIf you just do TV or video then you become a tool of the record industry. All you're doing is selling a product. It\u2019s when I get on stage with the band and we play that I know that people love the music. I can feel it. Sometimes I yearn to be on the road. The feeling overwhelms me.\"\n\nIntrusive media interest in her private life has inspired a continuing reluctance on her part to participate in the promotional game. Having been travestied in print on many occasions, Sade rarely gives interviews. \u201cIt's terrible this Fleet Street mentality that if something seems simple and easy, there must be something funny going on.\"\n\nFor most of the past 20 years, Sade has prioritised her personal life over her professional career, releasing only three studio albums of new material during that period. Her marriage to the Spanish film director Carlos Scola Pliego in 1989; the birth of her daughter in 1996 and her early 21st century move from North London to rural Gloucestershire, where she now lives with a new partner, have consumed much of her time and attention. And quite rightly so. \u201cYou can only grow as an artist as long as you allow yourself the time to grow as a person,\u201d Sade says. \u201cWe're all parents, our lives have all moved on. I couldn't have made Soldier of Love any time before now, and though it's been a long wait for the fans \u2013 and I am sorry about that - I'm incredibly proud of it.\"","category":"Musician\/band","description":"http:\/\/www.sade.com\nhttp:\/\/twitter.com\/sadeofficial\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/sadevevo\nhttp:\/\/www.myspace.com\/sade\nhttp:\/\/superbientotal.com","is_published":true,"record_label":"Epic","release_date":"Bring Me Home Live DVD out now.

{"category":"Musician\/band","description":"Tool is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up has included drummer Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, and vocalist Maynard James Keenan. Since 1995, Justin Chancellor has been the band's bassist, replacing their original bassist Paul D'Amour. Tool has won three Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.The band emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, Undertow (1993), and later became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their second album, \u00c6nima, in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued with Lateralus (2001) and the most recent album, 10,000 Days (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim and commercial success around the world.Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock and art rock. The relationship between the band and today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship and the band's insistence on privacy.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":96,"website":"http:\/\/exclaim.ca\/Features\/Timeline\/tool-stepping_out_from_shadows","were_here_count":0,"id":"109411479084590","name":"Tool","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Tool\/109411479084590","likes":1216091}

Le slogan vient en t\u00eate de la Radiolina, portion politico-po\u00e9tique et canal news du site internet : www.manuchao.net. La Radiolina est \u00e9galement le titre de l'album 2007 du m\u00eame Jose Manuel Arturo Tomas dit : Manu Chao, fils d'un certain Ramon du m\u00eame nom. \n\nJ'ai r\u00e9cemment retrouv\u00e9 un document t\u00e9l\u00e9 de 1987 dans lequel, en pur proph\u00e8te des vari\u00e9t\u00e9s (s'il vous plait), j'annon\u00e7ais \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision le succ\u00e8s \u00e0 venir de Manu Chao \u00e0 un Antoine De Caunes amical et presque attendri par mon enthousiasme. \nCe dernier me disait avant de lancer mon sujet : \u00ab tu as fait l\u00e0 un des reportages que tu voulais voir \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9 : sur \u00ab les petits les obscurs, les sans grades ? \u00bb \u00bb\u2026 \nA l'heure o\u00f9 j'\u00e9cris ces lignes, je lis dans le Los Angeles Times du 4 juin 2007 que Manu Chao, qui donne l'impression d'\u00eatre partout chez lui dans le monde, triomphe devant 11 000 fans \u00e0 la \u00ab L.A Sport Arena \u00bb. \n\nMoi qui pose aujourd'hui en grand pronostiqueur, j'avoue, bien que le charisme et le talent du jeune homme m'apparaissaient comme \u00e9vidents, n'avoir pas vu si loin, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque o\u00f9 la Mano Negra n'avait m\u00eame pas encore donn\u00e9 de concert. Mon reportage passait dans l'\u00e9mission \u00ab Rapido \u00bb. En revoyant ce petit portrait, j'entends le commentaire off par la voix de n'avait m\u00eame pas encore donn\u00e9 de concert. Mon reportage passait dans l'\u00e9mission \u00ab RapidoGilles Verlant : \u00ab \u00e0 vingt quatre ans, dans sa piaule, Manu Chao se repasse les disques de ses h\u00e9ros \u2026 \u00bb. Et Manu d'expliquer comment il a fait de la musique de certains pionniers son \u00e9cole, et ayant assimil\u00e9 tout \u00e7a, il compose maintenant ses morceaux. Puis il ajoute : \u00ab si j'habitais en Espagne je ne ferai pas du rock, en Espagne le rock c'est le flamenco. L\u00e0-bas, Camaron c'est un Dieu. C'est le Johnny Thunders de cette musique l\u00e0, etc \u00bb. Vingt ans plus tard, les dieux autodestructeurs, Camaron et Thunders sont physiquement morts. Quant \u00e0 Manu il vit en bonne sant\u00e9 en Catalogne, et ne se demande plus s'il fait du rock ou du flamenco. Il a bien conscience de faire du Manu Chao. Sans ignorer pourtant, \u00e0 l'instar des Chuck Berry, Ray Charles, Fats Domino et ceux du monde hispanique, ce qu'il doit \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs. Car eux non plus ne sont pas tomb\u00e9s du ciel, artistiquement, ceux l\u00e0 aussi citaient souvent leurs influences et ont du se voir reprocher, par ceux qui au pr\u00e9sent ne prennent pas tr\u00e8s bien la dimension des choses, de ne pas toujours se renouveler. David Byrne qui n'\u00e9tait pas mal non plus avec ses Talking Heads avoue avec humour un brin de jalousie pour les seules r\u00e9serves qu'il fait dans un \u00e9logieux reportage sur un concert de Manu \u00e0 Brooklyn en 2006. \n\nSi le deuxi\u00e8me album solo de Manu \u00e9tait apparu \u00e0 certains comme trop proche du premier, c'est qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 compos\u00e9 dans la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode. \u00ab La Radiolina \u00bb est emprunt d'une sophistication jamais atteinte. C'est \u00e0 mon avis un tr\u00e8s grand disque. Le style patchwork a gagn\u00e9 en raffinement. Je n'\u00e9cris pas ici pour en faire l'analyse mais seulement pour saluer globalement l'effort artistique et humain d'un petit gars n\u00e9 \u00e0 Paris, et comme on a pris l'habitude de dire : issu de l'\u00e9migration, qui tout en ayant cr\u00e9\u00e9 quelque chose de gigantesque, n'a jamais chang\u00e9 de mode de vie. Il n'h\u00e9site d'ailleurs pas \u00e0 se confronter \u00e0 ses d\u00e9tracteurs qui lui reprocheraient des contradictions. Ce sont l\u00e0 des choses qui seront d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es en d'autres lieux. \nIl est \u00e0 ce propos question d'une rencontre entre Manu et un philosophe dans un num\u00e9ro \u00e0 venir du mensuel \u00ab Philosophie \u00bb. \nEt au chapitre de l'engagement, Manu qui dort encore tr\u00e8s naturellement (c'est \u00e0 dire : pas pour se la jouer) sur le canap\u00e9 un soir de f\u00eate chez des potes, tout en ayant conscience d'avoir g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 l'entit\u00e9 consid\u00e9rable \u00ab Radio Bemba \u00bb se retrouve en 2007 avec le leitmotiv de : \u00ab Et maintenant qu'est-ce qu'on fait ? \u00bb. Il ne pr\u00e9tend pas avoir de solution. Il n'est pas pass\u00e9 de L'Esperanza au d\u00e9sespoir, mais comme il le dit \u00e0 propos du train o\u00f9 vont les choses : pas besoin d'\u00eatre un grand \u00e9conomiste pour comprendre que \u00e7a ne va pas s'arranger. Ils sont de plus en plus nombreux ceux qui ne marchent plus dans la combine. Bien des gens voudraient freiner la machine qui nous emm\u00e8ne dans le mur. Ce ne sont pas les bonnes volont\u00e9s qui manquent, le probl\u00e8me est : comment s'organiser ? \n\u00ab Et vous en France (il vit principalement \u00e0 Barcelone), vous allez vivre au moins pendant cinq ans ce qu'on a v\u00e9cu avec Aznar. Quand je pense que j'ai eu des concerts interdits sous pr\u00e9texte que j'\u00e9tais une source de terrorisme. \u00bb \n\nIl a donc cr\u00e9\u00e9 un style. Ce qui est assur\u00e9ment le plus difficile. Un style composite avec ses r\u00e9currences, comme ses m\u00e9langes d'idiomes, ses arri\u00e8res plans sonores : voix, bruits de villes, ses sir\u00e8nes de flics et d'ambulances, ses slogans protestataires, ses constats attrist\u00e9s sur l'\u00e9tat du monde et l'esp\u00e9rance \u00e0 entretenir dans le bordel de la vie. Plus tard on ne saura plus trop si telle ou telle chanson vient du deuxi\u00e8me ou du sixi\u00e8me album. Ce sera du Manu Chao. Tout comme Brassens a fait du Brassens. Si Brassens est reconnu comme po\u00e8te au langage riche et ch\u00e2ti\u00e9 y compris pour dire des \u00ab cochoncet\u00e9s \u00bb, Manu Chao aura eu le g\u00e9nie de la na\u00efvet\u00e9 assum\u00e9e. Il aura cultiv\u00e9 un langage na\u00eff comme des Picasso, des Chaissac, des Dubuffet, et d'autres l'ont fait en peinture. \nIl assume ce geste qui consiste en une stylisation du langage minimaliste avec accent cara\u00efbe dont l'arch\u00e9type h\u00e9rit\u00e9 serait le \u00ab Havana Moon \u00bb de Chuck Berry. Il faut voir la passion qu'il met dans la r\u00e9alisation de clips d'animations faits de dessins \u00ab enfantins \u00bb de son ami Wo pour chacune de ses chansons. \n\nManu, aujourd'hui tr\u00e8s heureux p\u00e8re d'un gar\u00e7on de huit ans qui vit dans le Nordeste br\u00e9silien et qu'il va retrouver chaque fois qu'il le peut, se pose continuellement des questions quant \u00e0 \u00e7a et d'autres choses. Et si le mode de vie qu'il s'impose exclut depuis toujours un esclavage contractuel qui le ferait revenir chaque ann\u00e9e avec un nouvel album pour, probablement, devenir plus \u00e9norme, il sait qu'il a aujourd'hui les moyens de tout arr\u00eater pour vivre plus libre encore. Lorsqu'on lui en parle il avance deux raisons pour ne pas le faire : la responsabilit\u00e9 qu'il s'est cr\u00e9\u00e9e envers ceux qui d\u00e9pendent de lui, le plaisir de servir ceux qui attendent ses chansons ainsi que l'amour envers ses diff\u00e9rentes activit\u00e9s. Je recompte sur mes doigts. Ca ne fait pas deux mais trois raisons. \n","category":"Musician\/band","is_published":true,"record_label":"Radio Bemba , Because Music y por la libre...","talking_about_count":69336,"username":"manuchao","website":"www.manuchao.net","were_here_count":0,"id":"258676355721","name":"Manu Chao","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/manuchao","likes":1876603,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152902327635722","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/424670_10152902327635722_438709999_n.jpg","offset_y":88,"offset_x":0}}

So please fill your glasses and let\u2019s hear it one more time for Mr. James Brown. All the way from Georgia, boy, the boy with the bucket (you know he did, but he shouldn\u2019t oughta took it) to the world renowned Godfather Of Soul. Mr. Dynamite, Mister Please, Please, Please himself, as of this writing, 70 years young, 50 years on from his show business debut, still out there like a tornado in your garden party.\n\n\tJames Brown is not the only African-American entertainer of estimable vintage still able to wreck the house. There\u2019s B.B. King, Ray Charles, Little Richard; and groups of amazing longevity like The Dells, The Four Tops, Gladys Knight & The Pips. But none has such a profound and prolonged influence as James Brown. Nor, at their peak, such persistent firepower: he was on the U.S. Billboard R&B charts for 20 years running. None exploded from the stage into national focus the way he did. And lest we forget, there have been countless examples to remind us that the self-proclaimed \u201cHardest Working Man In Show Business\u201d became the Hardest Worked Sample.\n\tJames Brown didn\u2019t set out to be a maverick. All he ever wanted was to be accepted on equal terms in the land of milk and honey. Truth be known, he\u2019d have probably liked to be Frank Sinatra in an alternate universe (and maybe he is). In the real world he worked himself and everyone him to unprecedented cathartic intensity in his quest to be Somebody. What repercussions that had. Music the like of which had never been heard before and reverberates to the present day. A career that took him from a whorehouse to The White House and put him on the frontline of U.S. social upheaval. A career that later went awry for awhile but is now recognized worldwide for what it is truly worth: A formidable body of work from a formidable man.\n\tJames Brown\u2019s biography has been told many times. But it\u2019s worth restating that he was born \u2013actually stillborn, until he was whacked into life \u2013 in a shack in the woods outside Barnwell, South Carolina, on May 3, 1933. Brown grew up to call nearby Augusta, Georgia, his hometown without enjoying a parental home. He was an underprivileged waif in a segregated society with sporadic formal education, but plenty of street smarts. Though enthralled by music, he devoted time to hustling; sports, which was curtailed by an injury; and petty theft, nipped in the bud by teenage arrest and imprisonment.\n\tParoled upstate in Toccoa, GA, in June 1952, Brown focused on music with sponsors, the locally respected Byrd family. He sang gospel with Sarah Byrd before hitting the R&B trail with her brother, Bobby Byrd\u2019s group. Thus began a 30-year musical partnership. After many local adventures under various aliases and personnel changes, their first professional recording, \u201cPlease, Please, Please,\u201d on Cincinnati, Ohio-based King Records, was credited to JAMES BROWN with The Famous Flames.\n\tPersistent sales throughout the southern U.S.A. and other territories made \u201cPlease, Please, Please\u201d a bona fide million-seller. But two years and nine flop follow-ups later, James Brown was still playing the boondocks, the original Flames had left him and King was about to let him go. A last chance session in late 1958, his first in New York, proved to be his salvation. \u201cTry Me\u201d hit U.S. R&B No. 1, Pop Top 50, and went gold in short order.\n\tUntil then, James Brown had relied on session musicians for recording. The success of \u201cTry Me\u201d gave him priority with Universal Attractions, a national booking agency, a mentor with its owner, Ben Bart, much broader exposure, and, crucially, his first cohesive band, at first a quintet led by tenor saxman J.C. Davis. He now faced a wider world with fuel to go.\n\tThis was not just the emergence of an extraordinary entertainer with whirling showmanship and increasing social relevance. Brown\u2019s expanding vision and unrelenting ego made him one of the great, autocratic bandleaders of the 20th century. In essence, he became the lead instrument \u2013 the astounding focus and motivator of evolving ensembles that blew everybody else away as they blasted into uncharted musical territory. With few notable exceptions, including  \u201cPrisoner Of Love\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s A Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World,\u201d the vast majority of Brown\u2019s blockbusters erupted live in the studio with his own musicians, extemporized in the heat of the moment, off the back of a groove, from the barest of performed ideas. This was the complete antithesis of the way groups like The Beatles and the Beach Boys began to take pop-rock into multi-layered musical fantasies. This was raw soul, as it happened.\n\tBy the time of his historic Live At The Apollo recording in October 1962, Brown\u2019s original feisty little band had expanded to a dozen or so tightly synchronized players led by trumpeter Lewis Hamlin. In 1964, under his own Fair Deal Production Company umbrella, Brown then revamped his music makers into a big band, taking on board young wannabe jazzers like arranger\/director Nat Jones (sax, keyboards) and the Parker Brothers, Maceo (sax) and Melvin (drums), in tandem with more experienced blues and R&B players Jimmy Nolen and Alphonso Kellum (guitars) and John \u201cJabo\u201d Starks (drums).\n\tThis was now a mightily swinging outfit. But when Jones quit in January 1967, and Alfred \u201cPee Wee\u201d Ellis (sax, keyboards) moved up the ranks to supersede him, ooowee! \u201cCold Sweat\u201d introduced a funk future that made them like no other band in the land. As drummer Clyde Stubberfield expressed it, \u201cMan we used to cut, like Sherman tanks coming down the aisles.\u201d\n\tJames Brown faced a crisis in early 1970: most of his tanks left him. Enter The Pacemakers, a wide-eyed group of young bloods featuring the Collins brothers, Phelps (guitar) and Bootsy (bass). Dubbed the J.B.\u2019s, this original line-up didn\u2019t run the course too long (\u201cSex Machine\u201d through \u201cSoul Power\u201d) but during their year\u2019s duty they re-energized an already astonishing career. \nAs old hands came back in the seventies, The J.B.\u2019s became another of the Godfather\u2019s powerhouse units, for several years under the direction of \u201cFriendly Fred\u201d Wesley (trombone), and prominently featuring Maceo Parker again. His return was celebrated in Fred Wesley & The J.B.\u2019s own \u201cDoing It To Death,\u201d a lively, million-selling jam now known \u2019round the world as \u201cGonna Have A Funky Good Time\u201d and still a part of Brown\u2019s stage show. \u201cGet Up Offa That Thing\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Too Funky In Here\u201d re-energized his late seventies songbook, while periodic chart comebacks, like \u201cStatic,\u201d his smash with disciples Full Force cut in the midst of the sampling madness, reminded the next generation who was still the Boss.\n\tPolydor released a 40th Anniversary compilation tribute to Mister James Brown in 1996. The Man himself requested a re-calculation: he started singing professionally in 1953, after all; a record deal is merely one step on a long, tough road that starts with step one. \u201cHard work, living, breathing and cooking with the music, is what it takes,\u201d says The Godfather.\nMr. Brown, we are forever grateful for it. Your music today is as vital as it was then.\n\n\u2014 Cliff White, 2003\n","category":"Musician\/band","description":"THE GODFATHER OF SOUL!","genre":"R&B, Funk and Soul","hometown":"Augusta, Georgia","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"Saharanpur","state":"","country":"India","zip":""},"record_label":"Polydor","release_date":"THE GODFATHER OF SOUL!","talking_about_count":13115,"username":"JamesBrown","website":"www.jamesbrown.com; smarturl.it\/JamesBrownApollo50","were_here_count":0,"id":"168216873205490","name":"James Brown","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JamesBrown","likes":1298933,"cover":{"cover_id":722534414440397,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1234754_722534414440397_2051127243_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"New album MASKS out Sept. 17! Get it here: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/ESTKMasks","band_members":"Alexia- Vocals \/ Guitars\/Keyboards\nAnissa- Bass\nCisko- Vocals\/ Live Guitar\nCaleb - Drums","bio":"At some point or another, everybody wears a mask. That fa\u00e7ade doesn't just hide imperfections or insecurities either. It allows its wearer to assume a different face. Sometimes, that's a dangerous proposition. Other times, it's the only way to find oneself. Eyes Set To Kill uncovered their identity within Masks, their fifth full-length album and first for Century Media Records. \n\nIn 2012, the band found itself mired in the search for a new label. That proved to be a rather daunting and frustrating undertaking where every meeting yielded a conflicting third-party perception of who Eyes Set To Kill should be. \n\n\"I felt like we were wearing a bunch of masks to impress people during those meetings,\" admits singer, songwriter, and guitarist Alexia Rodriguez. \"At one point, I had a bit of a revelation. We had gone through so many changes over the years. It wasn't about anybody else though. It was about us. We really found the band's face at that point. We weren't wearing masks anymore.\"\n\nInstead of pandering or worrying about expectations, the band\u2014Alexia, her sister Anissa [bass], Caleb Clifton [drums], and Cisko Miranda [screams]\u2014hunkered down and demoed two of its strongest songs to date, the irresistibly incendiary \"True Colors\" and \"Nothing Left to Say\". Both merged anthemic scope and jarring metallic elegance, making for some of the group's catchiest fare. As a result, Century Media immediately signed them.  \n\"Those two songs served as a blueprint for the entire record,\" explains Alexia. \"When we were writing, I didn't try to do what everybody else does. We didn't need to throw a ton of riffs into one song or get overly technical. I wanted to make music that was catchy.\"\n\nWith that mindset, the group retreated to a Southern California studio with producer Steve Evetts [The Dillinger Escape Plan, Sepultura]. In the process, Alexia evolved immensely as the band's songwriter, and the band's patented sound expanded. For the first time, Cisko added staggering screams, building the harmonies. Everything became amplified from the heaviness to the hooks. \n\n\"I was never really an underground kind of girl,\" says Alexia. \"I grew up on bands like Nirvana and more alternative rock, but I also related to metal and post-hard-core at the same time. Melody makes music relatable. I want people to remember the songs and relate to them.\"\n\nThe first single \"Infected\" certainly upholds that. A battering guitar groove gives way to a soaring refrain from Alexia. It's an unforgettable and unshakable introduction to the next phase of Eyes Set To Kill. \nShe goes on, \"Sometimes, in relationships, people get manipulated into thinking that they're the insane one or they have something wrong with them. They get portrayed like they're 'infected', but they're really not. They're just being manipulated. It hits hard, and it's got a lot of anger. At the same time, it shows listeners they're not alone.\"\n\nEyes Set To Kill have been providing fans that outlet since they first emerged from Phoenix, AZ in 2003. Since then, they have amassed over 1.17 million Facebook likes, covered USA Today, and landed on Alternative Press's coveted \"100 Bands You Need to Know List\". On the road, they've developed into a veritable whirlwind, sharing stages with everyone from Papa Roach to Black Veil Brides. They've crossed the globe four times on tour and even headlined a festival in Jakarta in front of 8,000-plus fans.\n\nNow, with the Masks off, Eyes Set To Kill stand primed to be heard louder than ever before. \"I feel like we've been working towards this record for our whole career,\" concludes Alexia. \"There were times I was almost going to give up. I'm glad I didn't. I'd love for this music to inspire everyone to keep going. It's always worth it to hold on to your dreams.\"\n\nAlexia- Vocals, guitar & keyboards\nAnissa- Bass\nCisko \u2013 Screams, live guitar\nCaleb \u2013 Drums & samples\t","booking_agent":"USA-Scott Sokol Pinnacle Entertainment...

{"band_interests":"\t\t\t\t","bio":"\u201cIn a world forever striving for peace, could Barry Manilow be the answer?\u201d - Washington Post after Barry Manilow\u2019s headlining performance at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway.\n\n\"Among the few things one can count on in life: the taste of McDonald's cheeseburgers, \"I Love Lucy\" reruns are still funny\u2014and Barry Manilow never wearing out his welcome at the top of the charts,\" -Billboard Magazine.\n\nWith worldwide sales of more than 80 million records, Barry Manilow\u2019s success is a benchmark in popular music.  His concerts sell out instantly.  He is ranked as the top Adult Contemporary chart artist of all time, according to R&R (Radio & Records) and Billboard Magazines.  Rolling Stone crowned him \u201ca giant among entertainers\u2026 the showman of our generation,\u201d and Frank Sinatra summed up Manilow best when Ol\u2019 Blue Eyes told the British press, \u201cHe\u2019s next.\u201d\n\nMusic is Manilow\u2019s passion -- both in the studio and in the classroom.  While he has released over 40 albums, Manilow has also raised millions of dollars through his Manilow Music Project.  In response to drastic budget cuts in arts programs across the U.S., the Manilow Music Project is keeping the music alive by ensuring that middle school and high school students have instruments in their hands to use in their music classes. \n\nManilow\u2019s roots are in his native Brooklyn, where music was an integral part of his life. By the age of seven, he was taking accordion lessons and playing on a neighbor\u2019s piano. Choosing a career in music while still in his teens, he attended New York College of Music and the Julliard School of Music while working in the mailroom at CBS. He subsequently became musical director for a CBS show named \u201cCallback\u201d (the predecessor of American Idol) which led to a lucrative sideline on New York\u2019s advertising jingle circuit. \n\nIn 1971, Barry Manilow met Bette Midler and became her music director, arranger and pianist. The following year, he signed with Bell Records to record his debut solo album. \n\nIn 1974, Clive Davis founded a new label, Arista, along with Columbia Pictures. Davis had the right to choose any artist on the Columbia Pictures-owned Bell Records to bring to Arista. Davis chose Manilow\nand the rest is history. He famously brought Manilow a recent U.K. hit rock song entitled \u201cBrandy\u201d (by its writer Scott English).  Clive and Barry changed the title to \u201cMandy\u201d so it wouldn\u2019t be confused with the Looking Glass U.S. hit \u201cBrandy.\u201d \n\nManilow, using his arranging and producing abilities, changed the rock song into the sweeping ballad that the world knows and when the Arista single reached Number One in early 1975, it ignited one of the most incandescent careers in pop music.\n\nManilow would describe himself as a musician before he would call himself a singer.   From the beginning, his love of music was, and still is in arranging, composing and songwriting.  All of which are evident in his latest album \u2013 his first original album in 10 years, 15 MINUTES.  More than two years in the making, Manilow produced the recording with Michael Lloyd and reunited with lyricist Enoch Anderson for the June 14th, 2011 release.   Inspired by the Andy Warhol quote:  \u201cIn the future, everybody will be world famous for fifteen minutes,\u201d this edgy, guitar-driven pop album is a captivating musical odyssey exploring the perils and pinnacles of fame\u2019s double edged sword.  Since its release, 15 MINUTES has seen great success; the album debuted at #7 on the Billboard Top 200 and #1 on the Independent Chart in June.  The most requested single off the album, \u201cEverything\u2019s Gonna Be All Right,\u201d was released recently as a remix and became Manilow\u2019s 49th Top 40 hit.  15 MINUTES was released by STILETTO Entertainment.  \n\nOn May 12, 2012, Manilow released his highest charting live album since 1974, LIVE IN LONDON.  This album features several of his most popular hits, including \"Can't Smile Without You,\" \"Mandy,\" and \"Copacabana (At The Copa).\" LIVE IN LONDON has seen great success, earning the #1 spot on Billboard\u2019s Top Internet Albums, #5 Indie Albums, and #24 of Billboard's Top 200. LIVE IN LONDON is the highest charting live album since 1977.\n\nBeginning in 2006, Manilow triumphed with his hugely successful series of albums celebrating the great songs of four decades starting with the platinum album, THE GREATEST SONGS OF THE FIFTIES, which entered at #1 on the Billboard 200 album chart.  \n\nNext came the platinum THE GREATEST SONGS OF THE SIXTIES released October 31, 2006, entering the chart at #2 and was the all-time highest first sales week debut chart entry of Manilow\u2019s career.  With the \u201cFIFTIES\u201d and \u201cSIXTIES\u201d albums, Manilow became the first artist since 1981 to have two albums in the top two positions in one calendar year on the Billboard chart.  \n\nThe success of the decades series continued with THE GREATEST SONGS OF THE SEVENTIES.  Released September 18, 2007, the chart debut of this album made Manilow the only artist to have three Top four debuts on the Billboard 200 chart in two years.\n\nTHE GREATEST SONGS OF THE EIGHTIES marked the fourth album of the decades series to enter in the Top 10.  \n\nIn the winter of 2010, Manilow completed his remarkable decades series with a Grammy\u00ae nomination for THE GREATEST LOVE SONGS OF ALL TIME, co-produced by Manilow, Clive Davis, and Michael Lloyd (Somewhere in Time and Dirty Dancing). \n\nOther Manilow album highlights touching on a multitude of music styles include:\n\nThe ground-breaking album called 2:00 AM PARADISE CAF\u00c9.  In 1985, Manilow stepped out of his pop comfort zone and crawled way out on a limb to create this original jazz album.  Set in an imaginary night club and featuring jazz legends Sarah Vaughan, Mel Torm\u00e9 and Gerry Mulligan, this album was the pinnacle of Manilow\u2019s originality.  Packed with all of Manilow\u2019s original compositions, the platinum 2:00 AM PARADISE CAF\u00c9 received the best reviews of Manilow\u2019s career. \n\nThe Techno-Jazz SWING STREET (1987) featured guest appearances by Stan Getz, Phyllis Hyman, Kid Creole, and Diane Schuur.  \n\nLater came SHOWSTOPPERS (1991), spanning nearly a century of Broadway show tunes. \n\n1994\u2019s SINGIN\u2019 WITH THE BIG BANDS, Manilow was paired with the orchestras of Les Brown, Duke Ellington, Jimmy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Harry James, and Glenn Miller on a glorious set of Swing Era standards.  \n\n1998\u2019s MANILOW SINGS SINATRA, paired Barry with Grammy-winning producer Phil Ramone, paying homage to the great songs made famous by the legendary Frank Sinatra. \n\nManilow is ranked as the top Adult Contemporary chart artist of all time, according to R&R (Radio & Records), with no less than 25 consecutive Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 between 1975 and 1983.  The list includes all-time favorites that Manilow still sings today: \u201cMandy,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s A Miracle,\u201d \u201cCould It Be Magic,\u201d \u201cI Write the Songs,\u201d \u201cTryin\u2019 To Get the Feeling Again,\u201d \u201cThis One\u2019s For You,\u201d \u201cWeekend In New England,\u201d \u201cLooks Like We Made It,\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t Smile Without You,\u201d \u201cEven Now,\u201d and the Grammy Award-winning \u201cCopacabana (At the Copa).\u201d  All of these songs (and more) were anthologized on the commemorative 1992 four-CD boxed-set, BARRY MANILOW: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION AND THEN SOME. \n\n To date, twenty-nine albums by Manilow have been certified platinum, while BARRY MANLOW\/LIVE (1977), EVEN NOW (1978), and GREATEST HITS (1978) are each certified triple platinum.\n\nEvery album produced by Manilow for other artists \u2013 including Bette Midler, Nancy Wilson, and Dionne Warwick \u2013 has been nominated for Grammy\u00ae Awards.  \n\nA winner of Grammy\u00ae, Emmy\u00ae, and Tony\u00ae Awards, Manilow\u2019s film credits include the Oscar\u00ae-nominated song \u201cReady To Take A Chance Again\u201d (from 1978\u2019s \u201cFoul Play\u201d), the production of Bette Midler\u2019s \u201cPerfect Isn\u2019t Easy\u201d (from Walt Disney\u2019s \u201cOliver and Company\u201d), and writing and scoring the soundtracks for the animated features \u201cThumbelina\u201d and \u201cThe Pebble and the Penguin.\u201d\n\n Highlights of Manilow\u2019s theater career range from his Tony\u00ae Award-winning Broadway debut in 1977 (in the same year that ABC-TV presented \u201cThe Barry Manilow Special\u201d to an audience of 37 million) to an SRO eight-week run on the Great White Way in 1989.  Beginning in 1997, Barry Manilow\u2019s \u201cCopacabana \u2013 The Musical\u201d, an elaborate two-act spectacular, played to packed houses in London\u2019s West End for 18 months before touring the U.S., Australia and Asia.  June 2001 saw the opening of \u201cCould It Be Magic? \u2013 The Barry Manilow Songbook.\u201d \n\n The singer has made countless television appearances ranging from Emmy\u00ae-winning network specials to cable concerts, and released such best-selling long-form home videos as \u201cLive On Broadway\u201d and \u201cBecause It's Christmas.\u201d  His two-hour 1996 A&E special, \u201cBarry Manilow: Live by Request\u201d was the highest rated music show in the network's history.  Manilow has also appeared on the highly rated TV series \u201cMurphy Brown,\u201d \u201cAlly McBeal,\u201d and \u201cWill & Grace.\u201d  In 2006, Manilow received his fifth Emmy\u00ae nomination and Emmy\u00ae win for the PBS special, \u201cManilow: Music and Passion.\u201d  The broadcast celebrated Manilow\u2019s 100th performance at the Las Vegas Hilton.  Produced by STILETTO Television, the Rhino DVD of the PBS special was soon certified triple platinum. \u201cBarry Manilow:  Happy Holiday!\u201d is Manilow\u2019s holiday-themed television special from A&E\u2019s \u201cLive By Request.\u201d  Originally broadcast from New York City on a snowy December night in 2003, this show is one of the highest-rated A&E \u201cLive By Request\u201d performances ever.\n\nIn June 2002, Manilow was inducted into the National Academy of Popular Music\u2019s Songwriters Hall of Fame alongside Ashford & Simpson, Michael Jackson, Randy Newman, and Sting.  In 2012 he was inducted into the Great American Songbook Hall of Fame. \n\nManilow is a member of the Board of Governors of the National Academy of Jazz.  His autobiography, Sweet Life: Adventures on the Way to Paradise, was published by McGraw-Hill in 1987.  In addition to his own foundation, the Manilow Fund for Health and Hope, other involvements include The Prince's Trust, United Way, the Starlight Foundation, and several leading organizations for AIDS prevention and research.  Manilow is the national spokesperson for the Foundation Fighting Blindness and a member of the Music Center of Los Angeles.\n\n In 2008, Manilow created The Manilow Music Project as part of his Manilow Fund for Health and Hope (www.manilowmusicproject.org). Answering the call of need at a time when arts and music programs in most schools is the first casualty in budget cuts, The Manilow Music Project was launched by providing $500,000 worth of musical instruments, as well as sheet music and music stands to 21 local schools in the Coachella Valley in California.  Manilow performed his first ever Hollywood Bowl concert on October 24th, 2009\u2013where, in association with the Manilow Music Project and the Grammy\u00ae Foundation, Manilow raised a donation of $100,000 in musical instruments for the Los Angeles United School District.  He also organized an instrument drive and donation for the Las Vegas\/Clark County School District to the tune of half a million dollars.  \n\nAs CNN reported in 2011, \u201cBarry Manilow not only writes the songs, he makes sure kids can too,\u201d referring to Manilow\u2019s cavalcade charge to assist the tornado-ravaged town of Joplin, Missouri.  Manilow personally delivered $300,000 in musical instruments to the town\u2019s only high school upon learning that the school music instruments had been blown away by the storm.\n\nThe Manilow Music Project continues to be a driving force in instrument drives and donations across the country.

{"about":"New Albums 'ORCA: Symphony No. 1 ' and 'Jazz-iz-Christ' Out Now - http:\/\/www.serjicalstrike.com","bio":"http:\/\/serjtankian.com\nhttp:\/\/twitter.com\/serjtankian\n\n\"Serj Tankian is not what he used to be. [He's better.] The Lebanese-born Armenian-American poet gone wild has blossomed beyond voice and hair into true fire and brimstone, melodic visionary perched on a cannonball soaring light speed through the heavens, striking chords from every cloud and raining from the heart.\n\nHis newest solo project ELECT THE DEAD, where he plays just about every instrument, shows more range than the US Missile System, exploding the parameters of \"political\" or intellectual music into realms of just good shit.\n\nSonic sanctuary is the term that comes to mind when describing Serj's voice. An angel scribbling into the margins of a book, unholy, contemplating the afterfuture while indicting the overbearing presence of the present (that's poetry mumbo jumbo for \"you'll find it pretty cool to hear your son singing along with this album\u2026 You'll pat yourself on the back for raising kids with good taste\").\n\nNow pop it in your Prius and listen.\"\n-Saul Williams\n\nOne of the most unconventional frontmen in rock, System Of A Down singer Serj Tankian emerges as a solo artist with his debut album Elect The Dead. System Of A Down, whose five genre-bending studio albums have sold over 16 million copies, went on an extended hiatus in August 2006. Since then, Tankian has been holed up in his home studio in Los Angeles writing, recording, and producing Elect The Dead. It is an album that showcases the writing and arranging prowess of a man best known for his inimitable vocals, incisive lyrics, and unwavering dedication to humanitarian causes.\n\n\u201cMaking Elect The Dead, I felt the exact same energy as I did recording System\u2019s debut in 1998, that sense of open experimentation, the idea that \u2018Wow, I\u2019m actually doing this\u2026\u2019 I was living, eating, and shitting this music every day. I\u2019d wake up in the morning and the thought of working on a song was so powerful I couldn\u2019t focus on anything else.\u201d\n\nNeither a mellow excursion into world music or the frantic war-cry of System that some had predicted, Elect The Dead is multi-faceted and multi-layered. It contains elements of psychedelia, classical, and the trademark surrealist images and skewed time signatures that Tankian has made his own. It is both thought-provoking and from the heart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a rock record,\u201d Tankian says enthusiastically. \u201cIt\u2019s a moving album with a lot of ups and downs, starts and stops, and tempo changes. It\u2019s depressing but it\u2019s uplifting; it\u2019s jazzy but it rocks.\u201d\n\nBorn in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1967 to Armenian parents during tumultuous political times, Tankian lived in Beirut until 1975 when his family emigrated to Los Angeles. A graduate of Marketing & Business from California State University, Tankian was running his own business developing Propriety Vertical Industry Modular Accounting Software (surely a first for a budding rock star?) when in 1995 he co-founded System Of A Down with three friends from the Armenian-American community.\n\nOver the next ten years, System rose to become one of the most inventive hard rock bands of their generation \u2014 a band with a conscience, a message, and a desire to constantly evolve. Tankian\u2019s contributions included not only the confrontational and often cryptic lyrics, but also a unique singing voice heavily inspired by growing up listening to his father sing traditional Armenian music. Tankian sings in a cadence like no other: An abrasive, paint-stripping, pulpit-bashing roar one moment, a maudlin lament the next.\n\nHaving achieved their goals, the members of System Of A Down decided to pursue their own projects. Tankian continued his work with Axis Of Justice \u2014 the grass-roots activist organization he launched with Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello \u2014 and nurtured his own Serjical Strike Records. He also lent his vocal and remix skills to a number of artists, ranging from Tool and Deftones to Wu Tang Clan and Notorious B.I.G., and published a book of poetry, Cool Gardens (2002), which remains a best-selling poetry collection. In 2003, he recorded a pan-international sounding album with acclaimed multi-instrumentalist Arto Tun\u00e7boyac--yan, under the name SerArt.\n\nIt should, by now, be pretty obvious that Serj Tankian is not your typical frontman.\n\nWhich brings us back to Elect The Dead. Forget the endless parade of collaborators, guests, remixers, or producers, the album is entirely Serj, though SOAD\u2019s John Dolmayan and Brian \u2018Brain\u2019 Mantia (Primus, Tom Waits, Guns N Roses) do lend their drumming skills to the project, and guitarist\/bassist Dan Monti and opera soprano Ani Maldjian make an appearance as well.\n\n\u201cWith Elect The Dead, the sky\u2019s the limit. There are no barriers between myself and the listeners on this album. It\u2019s more direct,\u201d says Tankian. \u201cIt\u2019s liberating because all the choices are mine. With this record all success or failure rests with me. It made me realize that I have an amazing life and I am getting to make a lot of my dreams come true.\u201d","category":"Musician\/band","is_published":true,"press_contact":"press\u0040serjicalstrike.com","record_label":"Serjical Strike Records","talking_about_count":11123,"username":"SerjTankian","website":"http:\/\/www.serjtankian.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"8047564797","name":"Serj Tankian","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SerjTankian","likes":1482544,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151783857849798","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1157476_10151783857849798_1787930766_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Get \"Fatal Distraction\" on iTunes: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/FatalDistraction?IQid=f\n\nGet \"Somebody Else\" on iTunes: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/somebodyelse?IQid=f","band_interests":"Call Mario!: 443-957-4831","band_members":"Mario","bio":"Natural can be described as innate or instinctive in essence, disposition or temperament. Quite simply, natural can be summed up as God-given or God-inspired because it comes so easily. When 24 year-old Grammy-nominated singer, songwriter, actor Mario realized that his talents came to him naturally, his growth and acceptance of these gifts aptly produced his third album, Go. \u201cI feel like this is what I\u2019m supposed to be doing. I\u2019m supposed to be at this place in every aspect of my life, from personal to business. This is where I am, this is where I chose to be.\u201d\nAt age 15, when his 2002 debut album Mario garnered 700,000 copies in sales, sparked by the lead single \u201cJust A Friend (2002),\u201d young Mario set the stage for his 2005 sophomore set aptly titled Turning Point. Worldwide, the album reaped 2 million units in sales as \u201cLet Me Love You\u201d propelled him to the number one spot for nine consecutive weeks. The single holds the honor of being one of the highest selling ringtones to date with 1.6 million downloads and Mario himself was bestowed with accolades including 2005\u2019s Billboard R&B\/Hip-Hop Award for Top R&B\/Hip-Hop Single, a Billboard Music Award for Hot R&B\/Hip-Hop Single of the Year and a slew of nominations from the Grammys, BET Awards, Vibe Awards, MOBO Awards and the Soul Train Music Awards.\nThe Baltimore, Maryland native witnessed the biggest transition of his young adult career between Turning Point and his new album Go. As a self-described old-soul, the wunderkind reflects on his journey introspectively, \u201cI\u2019ve always been that way, I\u2019m just able to express myself more and I have time by myself instead of everybody always being in my ear. When you have time by yourself, you can see and analyze things for what you think they are.\u201d While his developing perspective continues to evolve, Mario\u2019s attitude and approach remain focused on the goal of longevity and happiness. \u201cAs you grow, you learn more about yourself and come upon things that touch people,\u201d adding, \u201cwhat makes me happy most is that I\u2019ve changed lives. I love to see people touched by my music. I love to see people touched by my growth.\u201d\nRaised in his formative years with his dearly departed maternal grandmother, then during his teens with his former management team, Mario quietly learned how to be faithful. \u201cThat\u2019s the real gift, to really experience things and really take it in. And don\u2019t just see it and overlook it, but really see it for what it is. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned how to do in these years. And that\u2019s a blessing to be able to understand that.\u201d\nCarefully weaving the fabric of his life over delicately orchestrated rhythms, Go utilizes its hip-hop influences, throwback soul sensibilities and lyrical honesty to demonstrate just what\u2019s been on Mario\u2019s mind. From changing management to relocating back to his hometown of B\u2019More, to exploring his sensuality and sexuality, Mario is prepared to unveil the sides of himself that have been hidden since his debut.\nOne revealing song is the Pharrell written and The Neptunes produced album title track, \u201cGo.\u201d As the scenario suggests, it explains different situations about spending time with a girl and while some guys feed women lines to get with them, at the end of the night it\u2019s time to \u201cgo.\u201d For Mario, it\u2019s a lyrical fantasy all in good fun. \u201cIt\u2019s not disrespectful, it\u2019s honest. They\u2019re going to tell you the sky is green, I\u2019m going tell you it\u2019s blue.\u201d\n\u201cHow Do I Breathe,\u201d is the melodic mid-tempo first single produced by Stargate, that simply granted Mario permission to \u201clet down my guard to let my fans know I\u2019m human. A lot of fellas can relate to the lyrics expressed in this song but they don\u2019t always say it.\u201d The same sentiment is true and expressed when Timbaland blends finger snaps, drum patterns, synthesizers and an airy piano on \u201cNo Definition.\u201d As ambiguous as the song title suggests, Mario would prefer to allow his actions to speak louder than words, as he will treat his woman like she deserves, however there is no title to this thing they have together.\nWith \u201cKryptonite,\u201d Mario wears his heart on his sleeve as he empathetically talks to his woman from a far. Serving as a co-writer on the harmonic track produced by Oak, Mario dares to express what most men quietly feel, as he reveals that he wants to be the Superman to his Lois Lane but his \u201ckryptonite\u201d are the other girls that constantly tempt him.\nMario treads on the sensual track with \u201cLet Me Watch,\u201d co-written by Sean Garrett and Michael Croom, co-produced by Mr. Collipark and Garrett. A more personal tale for the bedroom and the clubs, this song \u201callows a woman to explore her sexuality in a very comfortable state and be ok with it\u201d explains the expressive crooner.\nProducers T-Wayne & Stee are behind the boards as they take it back about two decades for the Keith Sweat remake \u201cRight and a Wrong Way.\u201d As Mario recollects vibing before they finally decided to re-record the track, \u201cit\u2019s me wanting to introduce something different to my fans and re-introduce a classic song to their parents or older siblings, etc.\u201d For Mario, the song means something different now as he looks to bring substantive music to the attention of the masses again. Admitting, \u201cbeing a young man that\u2019s willing to be submissive that\u2019s what that song means. I understand that there is a right and a wrong way to do things and I\u2019m willing if you\u2019re willing.\u201d\nSinger, songwriter, producer Akon contributed the emotional \u201cDo Right\u201d in which Mario addresses his relationship with his mother. \u201cComing up, some family and friends weren\u2019t on the right path. In some cases, wrong turns can be over looked but I had to look at them for what they were.\u201d The result has been to overcome life\u2019s challenges in order to pursue his love for singing and turn that love into the stellar music career that he\u2019s experiencing today.\nThat process of growth for Mario has been therapeutic as the freedom of expression became comforting because there was no \u201cfear of being judged.\u201d Assuredly, \u201cthere are a lot of songs on this album that the fans can relate to. I want them to go out there and feel proud about picking this album up in the store. You can rock it at any time and feel like you are a part of what I\u2019m doing when it comes to this movement.\u201d\nThis multi-layered \u201cmovement\u201d featured Mario the actor in the 2006 teen dance movie Step Up, which debuted at #2 and grossed over $21 million during its opening weekend. In January 2007 Mario continued his burgeoning acting career with a lead role as an at-risk student in the Paramount Pictures\/MTV Film Freedom Writers with Hilary Swank, now available on DVD.\nBeing the voice of a generation is a heavy responsibility, but Mario Barrett is up for the task at hand. Optimistic and faithful, Mario is clear that his role as an entertainer is to perform, however his obligation is to give back to others. He looks toward the distant future to reposition the spotlight off of himself and his personal accomplishments in order to develop and invest in other things \u2013 music, artists and a non-profit for underprivileged kids and those that grew up with parents with substance abuse problems like him.\nSoul Truth will be the breeding ground for developing talent under Mario\u2019s wing. \u201cI\u2019m in touch with my soul. Your soul is what carries you and that was the realist thing I could find that I could relate to people with. And then truth just comes from what I stand for and me not ever wanting to take for granted that God has given me a gift to be who I am and stand for just that, and that\u2019s a gift too. Soul Truth!\u201d\n\u201cGo is really just about me finding out who I am and really getting a grasp of it because I know I\u2019m going to give my all, and my career is only going to go up. I\u2019m a very spiritual person. I see God in everything.\u201d Maturing and accepting who he is becoming is the greatest gift Mario could have ever given to himself, and thankfully, his fans get to come along for the ride.","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"Baltimore, MD","is_published":true,"record_label":"RCA Records","talking_about_count":120918,"username":"mario","website":"www.mario2u.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"6148469778","name":"Mario","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mario","likes":1895943,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151661168019779","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1231633_10151661168019779_1449132518_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

She made chart history in 2003 when she became the first artist in 20 years, and the first female recording artist ever, to simultaneously reach #1 in the U.S and the U.K with both her debut solo album Dangerously In Love and single \"Crazy In Love\", a feat accomplished by a mere handful of artists -- including the Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, Rod Stewart, and Men At Work. Beyonc\u00e9 toured America for the first time as a solo artist in 2004 in support of her #1 multi-platinum debut solo album, Dangerously In Love which earned her five Grammy Awards that year including Best Contemporary R&B Album and Best R&B Song for \"Crazy In Love\" featuring Jay-Z. With her five-in-one-year Grammy win, Beyonc\u00e9 tied the record for the most Grammy\u2019s to be won in a single year by a female artist. \n\nOn September 4, 2006 (September 5 in the U.S.), Beyonc\u00e9 released her second solo album B'DAY to coincide with her 25th birthday. B'DAY closed out 2006 as one of the year's most successful albums, entering the Billboard Top 200 best-selling albums chart at #1 and achieving 2006's highest first week's sales of any female recording act, group or solo. \n\nOn February 11, 2007, B'DAY won the Grammy for Best Contemporary R&B Album, resulting in Beyonc\u00e9's 10th Grammy win overall and 7th win as a solo artist. In November of that year, the American Music Awards honored Beyonc\u00e9 with the International Artist Award making her the first woman in AMA history and sixth artist overall to be recognized with the prestigious award. In December of 2007, Beyonc\u00e9 received two more Grammy nominations for chart-topping singles from B\u2019DAY: Record of the Year for \"Irreplaceable\" and Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals for \"Beautiful Liar,\" her superstar duet with Shakira. \"Beautiful Liar\" set the all-time record for the biggest chart jump in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 bulleting upward an unprecedented 91 slots (#94* to #3*) in a single week. \n\nIn 2007, Beyonc\u00e9 embarked on the tour of the year, \"The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience\" which showcased the international music and film star, along with her sizzling all-female band,\"The SUGAMAMA'S\" performing musical hits, classics, and surprises in an innovative and high-tech concert environment. November 2007 saw the release of The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience LIVE!, a deluxe DVD capturing all the visual thrills and musical excitement of her spectacular world concert tour. Recorded on September 2, 2007 during Beyonc\u00e9's performance at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience LIVE! DVD contains Beyonc\u00e9's full concert performance and features a cameo from Jay-Z and the historic reunion of R&B\/pop super group Destiny's Child. The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience LIVE! has been certified platinum by the RIAA. \n\nNovember 18, 2008 marked the release date for the most anticipated album of the year, I AM\u2026SASHA FIERCE. The two-disc set was a musical showcase for Beyonc\u00e9 as never seen nor heard before from the artist. Each of the discs revealed a distinctly different side of her personality, character and sensibility; a forum for the yin-and-yang of her developing artistry. \u201cI AM\u201d displayed the intimate, heartfelt ballads while \u201cSASHA FIERCE\u201d boldly gave voice to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s up-tempo, dance-oriented other side. It was the most-talked about album of 2009, with the video for the track, \u201cSingle Ladies (Put A Ring On It),\u201d becoming the most-watched and most mimicked around the globe. \n\nBeyonc\u00e9 started the year 2010 with historic wins at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. Coming into the awards ceremony as the most nominated artist of the year with ten nominations, most from her worldwide #1 album, I AM\u2026SASHA FIERCE, Beyonc\u00e9 took home six Grammy\u2019s\u00ae, setting a record for the female artist with the most wins in one single year. She has now earned 16 Grammy\u2019s overall. \n\nHer historic six wins include: Song of the Year \u201cSingle Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\u201d, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance \u201cHalo\u201d, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance \u201cSingle Ladies (Put A Ring On It),\u201d Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance \u201cAt Last\u201d, Best R&B Song \u201cSingle Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\u201d, Best Contemporary R&B Album I AM\u2026SASHA FIERCE. The win for \u201cAt Last\u201d honored her work on the Cadillac Records soundtrack for her rendition of the Etta James hit which was seen by a worldwide audience in 2009 on Inauguration night, when she performed for President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at their request. \n\nThe \u201cI AM\u2026\u201d World Tour in support of the critically acclaimed album opened in Canada in March 2009 and took Beyonc\u00e9 to over 100 cities around the world. She performed to sold-out crowds on every continent, including her biggest live solo concert audience ever in S\u1eb7o Paulo, Brazil, where 60,000 fans attended the show on February 6, 2010 at Morumbi Stadium. Billboard Magazine named the \u201cI AM\u201d World Tour the #1 concert attraction of 2009. Billboard also named Beyonc\u00e9 Woman of the Year in October 2009 and Top Female Artist of the Decade in December 2009. \n\nAt the end of the North American leg of the tour in August 2009, Beyonc\u00e9 performed four sold-out nights at Encore Theater at Wynn Las Vegas. She re-worked and re-imagined her arena show as \u201cI AM\u2026YOURS An Intimate Performance At Wynn Las Vegas,\u201d to fit the smaller, more intimate 1500 seat theater. The show was released as a concert DVD on November 23, 2009 featuring a biographical story telling woven between many songs and exclusive behind-the-scenes footage. On Thanksgiving Night, the ABC television network aired a one-hour special of the live Vegas show. The I AM\u2026WORLD TOUR , directed by Beyonc\u00e9 for her own Parkwood Entertainment, debuted exclusively on ABC television as a 90-minute Thanksgiving Day primetime special. The DVD was released on November 26, 2010. \n\nBeyonc\u00e9 took most of 2010 off after the tremendous success of all things I AM\u2026, the album, the tour, the TV special and the DVD. She traveled around the world and listened to different influences that inspired her latest album, 4, released on June 28, 2011. Two days before the album\u2019s release Beyonc\u00e9 made her historic debut on The Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury, performing for a crowd of 200,000. \n\nThe critically acclaimed 4 is a shape-shifting piece of musical work for Beyonc\u00e9 . Opening with three platinum-plated ballads to mid-tempos, 4 sets out its vision as a radical sidestep from the era-defining club and pop hits of Destiny's Child. For the first half of the album, before she jumps off into the street-smart 90s NewJack bounce of \"Party\", a collaboration with Kanye West and Andre 3000, you might even call it her rock record. Touring the world along with her husband, Jay-Z and his entourage in 2010 had opened her up to the possibilities of new genres and the magnitude of the festival experience. She had started looking beyond stadiums, watching Linkin Park and Muse and Rage Against The Machine whip up their adoring fans in different ways than pop music intuits. She liked what she saw. Beyonc\u00e9 started thinking about the possibility of re-writing her place in musical history. 4is bold, experimental and showcases Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s formidable, flawless voice to perfection on some impressive ballads, including \u201c1+1,\u201d \u201cI Care,\u201d and \u201cI Was Here.\u201d The bolder side of 4 include \u201cCountdown,\u201d \u201cLove On Top,\u201d and the album\u2019s debut single, \u201cRun The World (Girls).\u201d \n\nIn August 2011, Beyonc\u00e9 performed the album 4 to an intimate audience over four nights at New York\u2019s famed Roseland Ballroom. The \u201cLive At Roseland\u201d DVD, also directed by Beyonc\u00e9, was released on November 21, 2011.","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"Houston, TX","is_published":true,"record_label":"Columbia Records","talking_about_count":759813,"username":"beyonce","website":"http:\/\/www.beyonce.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"28940545600","name":"Beyonc\u00e9","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/beyonce","likes":52732635,"cover":{"cover_id":"10153374749965601","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc1\/s720x720\/64200_10153374749965601_61049151_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":-2}}

{"about":"Welcome to the official Kinks page","category":"Musician\/band","is_published":true,"location":{"street":"","city":"London","state":"","country":"United Kingdom","zip":""},"personal_info":"The Kinks are recognised as one of the most important and influential British groups of all time, with millions of record sales and countless awards and accolades to their name. From their explosive beginnings as part of the British Beat movement to forays into concept albums, stadium rock and acoustic balladeering, The Kinks have left an unimpeachable legacy of classic songs, many of which form the building blocks of popular music as we know it today.\n\nHailing from Muswell Hill in north London, The Kinks were formed by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. Calling themselves The Ravens, an early line-up saw them playing a combination of skiffle and rock and roll with friend Peter Quaife on bass. A self-produced demo tape reached  record producer Shel Talmy who helped the band land a contract with Pye Records in 1964. Before signing, the group replaced their drummer with Mick Avory and renamed themselves The Kinks. \n\nWith the classic line-up in place, music history was about to be written and, after two failed singles (including a cover of Little Richard's Long Tall Sally), the group's third, You Really Got Me, stormed to the top of the UK charts. Written by Ray and Dave in their parents' front room, the song has since been cited as the inspiration for garage rock, punk, heavy metal and on contempories The Who. An album, The Kinks, was hastily assembled in the aftermath of the monster hit and was, in turn, swiftly followed by a second Top 10 single, All Day and All Of the Night. \n\nBetween 1965-1967, The Kinks enjoyed their  first commercial peak, scoring nine British and seven US chart hits. 1965's Tired Of Waiting For You displayed Ray's world-weary vocal style while Dave came up with a then innovatory Indian style drone guitar on See My Friends. As Ray's songwriting developed, he emerged as a witty, compassionate social commentator, chronicling the absurdities and aspirations of English life. He took stabs at fashion victims with Dedicated Follower Of Fashion and his fellow nouveau rich pop star peers on Sunny Afternoon. He even created a hymn to the Thames on the peerless Waterloo Sunset.\n\nDespite the Kinks' commercial success at home, an unresolved dispute with the American Federation of Musicians during a 1965 tour, led to a ban on US appearances which lasted until 1969. These problems coupled with the pressures of recording and touring caused Ray to collapse from nervous exhaustion in 1966. So, with most UK bands looking to America's burgeoning flower power revolution for inspiration, Ray looked no further than his back garden for his own concept album, 1968's Village Green Preservation Society. On the album Ray developed the major themes of his work, a lament for the traditions of a near-mythical England lost among modernity. Despite flirting with the de rigeur psychedelia sound, the album was overlooked by the British record-buying public and one of the Kinks' most artistically successful albums slipped away. Fortunately, subsequent years have seen it grow in stature and it\u2019s now recognised as one of the most important British albums ever released.\n\nThe loftily named follow up, Arthur - The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, addressed similar themes, portraying an English family looking back over their experiences before emigrating to Australia featuring the oft-covered Victoria. The mood lightened a little with the monster 1970 hit single Lola. 1971's Muswell Hillbillies album echoed Village Green's collection of storybook vignettes and the single Supersonic Rocketship from Everybody\u2019s In Showbiz went Top 20 in 1972 while Celluloid Heroes from the same album became a live favourite . The remainder of the '70s found our heroes tackling a dazzling array of real-life themes and situations with the bands four concept albums, Preservation Act 1, Preservation Act 2, Soap Opera and Schoolboys in Disgrace. While the UK hits dried up, their sizeable following in the US brought them commercial rewards and, in 1977, a Top 30 album in the form of Sleepwalker. \n\nTwo years later the band released the hard rock Low Budget album and became belated rock stars in America, gaining a sizeable chunk of the stadium rock circuit, selling out Madison Square Gardens. The Americans also lapped up early 80's albums Give The People What they Want and State Of Confusion which featured the hit singles Better Things and Destroyer. The Kinks even found themselves back in the  UK charts with 1983\u2019s, Come Dancing.  For many years The Kinks had been receiving reverential nods from the rock fraternity, all of which increased their cachet with wave after wave of new bands and musicians. In 1978 The Jam had covered David Watts while The Pretenders had their first UK hit with a version of Stop Your Sobbing. Biggest of all was Kirsty McColl\u2019s  breathtaking take on \u2018Days\u2019. \n\nThrough the 90s, The Kinks garnered a whole new generation of fans as yet another wave of British musicians paid tribute to the band. Blur\u2019s Damon Albarn in particular acknowledged Davies as a key influence: the classic Kinks sound and sensibilities underpin the Brit Pop-ers\u2019 classic triptych of \u2018London albums\u2019, Modern Life Is Rubbish, Parklife and The Great Escape. With The Kinks on hiatus since 1996 Ray Davies continued to record and tour acclaimed albums like 2006\u2019s Other People\u2019s Life and 2007\u2019s Working Man\u2019s Caf\u00e9. In 2009 he released The Kinks Choral Collection, an album of Kinks compositions in collaboration with the Crouch End Festival Chorus. \n\nDespite intermittent rumours to the contrary throughout the late 1990s and 2000s, ill-health scuppered plans for a reunion of the original line-up. Sadly, Peter Quaife, who had been receiving kidney dialysis for more than ten years, died on 23rd June 2010. Ray Davies dedicated his June 27th performance at the Glastonbury festival to his honour, telling the crowd, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here today if it wasn\u2019t for him\u201d. \n","talking_about_count":10486,"username":"TheKinksOfficial","website":"http:\/\/www.thekinks.info\/ http:\/\/www.raydavies.info http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Ray-Davies\/125755857457153 http:\/\/www.davedavies.com\/new.htm http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/profile.php?id=1295887224#!\/profile.php?id=1295887224 http:\/\/www.detune.tv\/ http:\/\/open.spotify.com\/user\/thekinksofficial\/playlist\/2dNcTkgj6pPkBmyn5TvlQG Kinks Website x 7","were_here_count":0,"id":"133206500059423","name":"The Kinks","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheKinksOfficial","likes":1034127,"cover":{"cover_id":578792918834110,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/553742_578792918834110_624784006_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

The group took the blues-rock sound of late '60s acts like Cream, Blue Cheer, and Vanilla Fudge to its logical conclusion, slowing the tempo, accentuating the bass, and emphasizing screaming guitar solos and howled vocals full of lyrics expressing mental anguish and macabre fantasies. If their predecessors clearly came out of an electrified blues tradition, Black Sabbath took that tradition in a new direction, and in so doing helped give birth to a musical style that continued to attract millions of fans decades later.","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Heavy Metal","hometown":"Birmingham, England","is_published":true,"record_label":"Universal \/ Vertigo Records","talking_about_count":507882,"username":"BlackSabbath","website":"http:\/\/www.blacksabbath.com http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/officialsabbath","were_here_count":0,"id":"56848544614","name":"Black Sabbath","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BlackSabbath","likes":9641039,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151845157309615","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash4\/s720x720\/1476254_10151845157309615_1326475792_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Three young Dubliners took on the world... Buy our new album: #3 HERE: http:\/\/smartURL.it\/thescript3","bio":"It\u2019s been a rags to riches glory ride, an emotional rollercoaster, an all action, all-star blockbuster.  Three young Dubliners took on the world, with music fashioned from the emotional detritus of their own hard lives raised up by a love of pop, rock, hip hop and soul.  In two years they notched up a handful of hit singles, including \u2018We Cry\u2019, \u2018Breakeven\u2019 and \u2018The Man Who Can\u2019t Be Moved\u2019.  Their 2008 debut album, \u2018The Script\u2019, went to number one in the UK and Ireland, approaching 2 million world wide sales.  They played stadium shows with music heroes U2, Take That and Paul McCartney.  They played a triumphant homecoming set at Ireland\u2019s Oxegen festival before 78,000 fans and won Best Live Performance at the 2010 Meteor Awards (beating their mentors U2).  And to cap it all, \u2018Breakeven\u2019 became one of the slowest climbers in US pop history, eventually hitting the top of Billboards Adult Pop Song radio airplay chart after 40 weeks on release.  \u2018Breakeven\u2019 has sold over 1.7 million downloads in the US alone. \n\nBut that was just the first draft. Now it\u2019s time to write a whole new Script.\n\nThe scene is a recording studio in London.  Two young Irishmen are listening to playback. Handsome, dark haired Danny O\u2019Donoghue is The Script\u2019s charismatic vocalist and keyboard player.  Shaven headed Mark Sheehan is their intense, loquacious guitarist.  Third member, friendly but taciturn drummer and multi-instrumentalist Glen Power is in an adjoining studio, laying down a beat.  Danny and Mark cannot sit still.  They are leaping about to the music blasting from huge speakers, an addictive blend of hip hop rhythms, flowing melodies, sparkling hooks and emotive, story-spinning lyrics, with Danny\u2019s mellifluous soulful vocals riding high over huge, anthemic choruses.  This is their forthcoming second album, \u2018Science And Faith\u2019, and it is fair to say the band are excited.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from playing little clubs to doing theatres, festivals and stadiums,\u201d says Mark. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit shocking to us as new band, playing to these mass audiences.  And we feel we have to touch everybody, hit ever fucker in there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so excited about this record,\u201d declares Danny.  \u201cWe are more confident about our sound, so you really want to fine tune your writing skills.  Find the essence of what we do, songs that mean something, that people would like to sing out loud at a concert.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to really think about who we are, what we are, and why it matters,\u201d continues Mark. \u201cTake all that experience and try and do something positive with it.   We really just want to nail that last album.  Put it to the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s like working out to the point of exhaustion,\u201d continues Danny.  \u201cWe come in here and try and give ourselves to the track, emotionally, spiritually, lyrically, musically, whatever we can give, and then walk out here utterly spent.  And then, job done.\u201d\n\nThe studio door flies open, and in bursts drummer Glen. \u201cI\u2019ve nailed that track lads!\u201d he declares.  \u201cWait til you hear it! I\u2019ve got blisters on my hands!\u201d\n\nThe Script are like this all the time, highly passionate, sincere and poetically articulate, with a tendency to talk over each other in their eagerness to express themselves.  The journey to their new album has been a strange one, with many twists and turns. Danny and Mark met in their early teens in Dublin, and had a long struggle for musical recognition, albeit picking up early admirers for their prodigious songwriting talent in U2.  They somehow wound up in the US, working as songwriters and producers with such R\u2019n\u2019B heroes as Dallas Austin, Teddy Riley and The Neptunes.  A chance encounter with Glen focussed their ideas on making their own music, and the trio was formed.  But in the midst of recording their debut album in Dublin, both Mark\u2019s mother and Danny\u2019s father passed away, inspiring bittersweet live favourite \u2018The End Where I Begin\u2019.  A meteoric rise through the world\u2019s charts followed but, even at the moment of their greatest triumph, they found themselves having to keep their pride in check, as their native Ireland sank into a devastating economic crisis, amongst the hardest hit of European nations following the credit crunch. \n\nAnd this is where the new chapter in The Script\u2019s tale really began.\n\n\u201cWe were coming back to Dublin victorious, only to be confronted with stark reality,\u201d recalls Danny. \u201cIt\u2019s like you've waited for that great day when you can say, \u2018I've finally made it\u2019 and everyone else is saying, \u2018My life has turned to shit\u2019.\u201d \n\n\u201cI actually felt really guilty,\u201d admits Mark. \u201cMeeting my mates who used to tell me I might need to get a real job to support my family, and buying me a beer when I was the one who was suffering.  The tables have turned quite considerably, and you want to be a little bit excited and go, \u2018oh, man, we just played with McCartney, we just got to number one,\u2019 but they're going \u2018I just lost my job\u2019, or \u2018I split up with my wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Ireland is a microcosm for the rest of the world,\u201d suggests Danny. \u201cSo here we were back in Dublin and there\u2019s a lot of relationships going on and we're seeing people who have met under money, under the Celtic Tiger, and they've never known what to do without money.  People are getting stripped of everything, stripped of their jobs and their homes and their furniture, so its going to back to an old thing of drinking cheap bottles of wine, having dinner on the floor, nothing but candlelight, and it\u2019s like they are meeting each other for the first time.  But I'm not saying that in a bad sense.  Its getting back to reality, you are standing naked in front of this person.  That notion really resonated with us, and we wrote a song, \u2018For The First Time\u2019.  I felt like it was something that could be a real flagship, to set the tone for what we want to talk about, emotionally.  And the rest has spun off from there.\u201d\n\nThe songs came thick and fast.  \u2018Exit Wounds\u2019, about the damage relationships can wreak. \u2018You Won\u2019t Feel A Thing\u2019, about suffering all the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune to protect your most loved ones.  \u2018Nothing\u2019 about a drunken, broken hearted phone call to a lost love (\u201cWe\u2019ve all been there,\u201d as Danny says).  \u2018Don\u2019t Change A Thing\u2019 about always leaving the door open for the possible return of a loved one.  And the title track, \u2018Science And Faith\u2019, about the primacy of love in the universal equation.  \u201cWith all of these subjects, we're always trying to attack at a level where it\u2019s optimistic,\u201d insists Danny.  \u201cWe're dealing with complex emotions in the simplest of ways, that's what we battle with in these songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn first listen, the subject matter might sound bleak,\u201d says Mark.  \u201cBut I think being Irish there is this undertone of hope all the time.  It\u2019s about having coping skills to get over things.  With Irish people, no matter how bad things get, you always pick yourself up and carry on.\u201d \n\nThe Script are songwriters of the first order, combining thoughtful, heartfelt lyrics with lush melodies.  They have fielded numerous requests to write for other artists (including Beyonce and James Blunt), preferring instead to focus on each other.  \u201cI feel, honestly, we are three people who write for us, and we write together, and feel those songs, internally, as mates,\u201d explains Mark. \n\n\u201cIf there was somebody I wanted to write with, I\u2019d probably be in a band with them,\u201d points out Danny.  \u201cI love writing with these ****ers!  It\u2019s a challenge.  You walk in here, you better be on the ball, cause these guys are good.\u201d \n \nThey still pronounce themselves incredulous that Paul McCartney personally asked The Script to support him at a series of American stadium shows.  \u201cThat was pretty mad, that he loved our songs, he knew them, came and watched us while we were playing on stage,\u201d says Mark.  \u201cHe said the reason he picked us was our message is very humble and honest.  We're not preaching, we invite people into our world, and our experiences, and to relate to us.  He felt like we were dealing with important stuff.\u201d\n\nThere can surely be no higher honour for a songwriter than the imprimatur of a Beatle.  But that\u2019s where the Script operate, in the highest realms of pop, easily accessible yet artistically, emotionally and spiritually resonant.  \u201cI don\u2019t see us as anything other than lads from Dublin,\u201d admits Mark.  \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2018m in some big band.  We come in and we make really heartfelt music.  I get to really express myself in this band.  And that\u2019s as far as it goes for me.  I\u2019m not trying to change the world.  I\u2019m not trying to heal anybody.  I generally find most of these songs are healing myself because getting them out has certainly helped externalise the feelings.  \u2018The End Where I Begin\u2019 is such a poignant song for us, from losing parents, that when we play it people ask \u2018do you feel like your reopening those wounds every night?\u2019  Well, yeah, I honestly do.  I set myself up for that song, I remind myself why it was written and what it was all about, and then we play it.  Yet it\u2019s not tough for me at all.  I feel justified.  I feel like I\u2019m actually sharing something that you all relate to.  You have all lost somebody too.  You can all understand exactly where this is coming from.  And it feels good to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what the Script is?\u201d says Danny.  \u201cIt\u2019s the journey from a feeling of devastation in the pit of my stomach, for me to be able to think about that, put it into words, to be able to sing it, a band to play it, for you to hear it, to go to your brain, to understand it and for you to replicate that same feeling.  It\u2019s such an amazing thing.  You couldn\u2019t work it out with a calculator.   But that\u2019s what we try and do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the pay off,\u201d says Mark.  \u201cThe thought of some person somewhere sitting in their apartment putting our music on because they are hurting and we\u2019re the soundtrack to that emotion, whatever is going on in their life.  That to me is the greatest power of music.  And I cannot get over that they might choose our record.  Cause I do that.  I sit in a room and pick out a song to articulate my feelings.  It floors me every time.\u201d\n\nGet ready for the return of The Script.  There are going to be more twists in this tale before it is done.\n\n\n","category":"Musician\/band","description":"Three young Dubliners took on the world...

But that\u2019s where the Script operate, in the highest realms of pop, easily accessible yet artistically, emotionally and spiritually resonant.  \u201cI don\u2019t see us as anything other than lads from Dublin,\u201d admits Mark.  \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2018m in some big band.  We come in and we make really heartfelt music.  I get to really express myself in this band.  And that\u2019s as far as it goes for me.  I\u2019m not trying to change the world.  I\u2019m not trying to heal anybody.  I generally find most of these songs are healing myself because getting them out has certainly helped externalise the feelings.  \u2018The End Where I Begin\u2019 is such a poignant song for us, from losing parents, that when we play it people ask \u2018do you feel like your reopening those wounds every night?\u2019  Well, yeah, I honestly do.  I set myself up for that song, I remind myself why it was written and what it was all about, and then we play it.  Yet it\u2019s not tough for me at all.  I feel justified.  I feel like I\u2019m actually sharing something that you all relate to.  You have all lost somebody too.  You can all understand exactly where this is coming from.  And it feels good to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what the Script is?\u201d says Danny.  \u201cIt\u2019s the journey from a feeling of devastation in the pit of my stomach, for me to be able to think about that, put it into words, to be able to sing it, a band to play it, for you to hear it, to go to your brain, to understand it and for you to replicate that same feeling.  It\u2019s such an amazing thing.  You couldn\u2019t work it out with a calculator.   But that\u2019s what we try and do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the pay off,\u201d says Mark.  \u201cThe thought of some person somewhere sitting in their apartment putting our music on because they are hurting and we\u2019re the soundtrack to that emotion, whatever is going on in their life.  That to me is the greatest power of music.  And I cannot get over that they might choose our record.  Cause I do that.  I sit in a room and pick out a song to articulate my feelings.  It floors me every time.\u201d\n\nGet ready for the return of The Script.  There are going to be more twists in this tale before it is done.\n\n\n\n","record_label":"Epic Records","talking_about_count":130555,"username":"thescript","website":"http:\/\/www.thescriptmusic.com http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/thescript http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/thescript http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/gp\/product\/B003U9V6A6?ie=UTF8&tag=rcalagr-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B003U9V6A6 ","were_here_count":0,"id":"10638675398","name":"The Script","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thescript","likes":5201449,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151772832585399","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/539621_10151772832585399_1021608885_n.jpg","offset_y":53,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"World Painted Blood Available Everywhere","band_members":"Tom Araya \nKerry King\nJeff Hanneman\nDave Lombardo","bio":"Fucking Slayer is back.\n\nFrom the opening squeals of the guitars of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman and the punishing breakaway attack of Dave Lombardo's drums on \"Flesh Storm\" it's clear from the first thirty seconds the thrash metal titans have returned to pummel listeners with a raging onslaught of new music guaranteed to lay waste to MP3 players, car stereo speakers and whatever else gets in their way.\nChrist Illusion marks the long-awaited return of the legendary Slayer. Its first record in five years and its first record in fifteen years with the original band line-up, Christ Illusion is a cacophony of brutality. A soundtrack for the post-Apocalypse. Steeped in scorching riffs and a litany of menacing tracks\/tirades on religion and violence, Slayer forges ahead on its devastating path of aural destruction with ten new songs, each charged with the electric hostility for which Slayer is renowned.\nOf the record Kerry King is ecstatic: \"I love it. I really like God Hates Us All and I think that's the best record we've done in my opinion since Seasons In The Abyss, and I like this better than that one. I think it's a more complete record, I think sonically it better: all the performances are awesome. I think this one is more intense not because we're trying to do 'Reign In Blood: The Sequel,' it's just that's where our writing is taking us now.\"\nSongs like the \"Flesh Storm,\" \"Eyes of the Insane,\" \"Skeleton Christ,\" \"Jihad\" and the first single, \"Cult\" showcase the band at its most blazing intensity. The sonic excitement of speed, propelled by King, Hanneman and Lombardo and lead by the immutable roar of Tom Araya provoke the listener with Slayer's trademark fascination with terror, violence and religion.\nFor as long as Slayer has been making records it has been surrounded by controversy.\nSince the band recorded its first album, \"Show No Mercy,\" Slayer has been plagued with accusations of Satanism, fascism, racism and so on. Christ Illusion gives no quarter to critics who would mindlessly attack the band for, what the Germans call, \"der Reiz des Unbekannten\" (meaning \"the attraction of the unknown\"). A lyric fascination with violence and terror which guitarist King enthusiastically describes this way: \"When I was I kid I would see a horror movie over a love story. Being shocked, being in an environment that's not reality might be frightening but is cool nonetheless. With a lot of our songs we put people in that place. It doesn't bother me because I enjoy it. It could easily be programming from all the fucking news channels.\"\nSlayer is often assailed for its subject matter, though the band is unrepentant. \" According to Araya, \"Violence, darkness... So much of my inspiration comes from news articles or pictures and just start describing the images. Television- A&E, the History Channel, Court TV, Documentaries.\"\nThe singer continues, \"With this record, as far as a theme: there is none. That's just our favorite subject matter. The common thread is death. I think that's just a common thread in general: we all share death, and we all share it at different times in different ways, but it's the one thing that we all have in common. We all die. It's how we live that makes us different.\"\nBeyond being controversial Slayer is an exceptional force in music, highly praised for its trailblazing style of fast, heavy and aggressive music yet bristling with melody. The much-heralded return of Dave Lombardo to the drummer's throne will leave fans gasping for breath as he clobbers the listener on song after song.\nCommenting on Lombardo's return to the fold, King notes, \"Not to say the shine's worn off, but it's old news to us. I think the thing the kids are going to get into, besides just being the first Slayer album in five years, is that Dave's on it. When he came back he wasn't a member, he just came back to do a couple of tours and people started asking back then 'Is he gonna hang around?' And I would tell them that was up to Dave. But I could tell that Dave was having a killer time.\" King confided. \"So it was just a matter of time before he said, 'Yeah, let's do it!' But it's great. And now that he's got a new Slayer album that he's played on, I think he's going to get some more enjoyment out of playing. He takes pride in everything he does and it's awesome to have him back with us.\"\nHaving the original members record their first album together in fifteen years is certainly newsworthy but the lasting might of the band and its continued popularity is an achievement few can boast. For each of the members, the band is resolute. There is no other band like Slayer.\n\"The staying power behind Slayer is that we've stuck to our guns,\" Says Araya. \"Integrity... that would be number one. A lot of it has to do with the fact that we've stuck to what we do best. And the fact that we've been together as a band for so long. Ten years with Dave; another ten without Dave; and now Dave's back. It has a lot to do with compromise, that's just the way it has to be. You have to be able to compromise and give and take and that has a lot to do with why we're still together and a force to be reckoned with. I've learned that without each other, Slayer wouldn't exist, and that the whole is greater than its parts.\"\nKerry King is far more succinct. \"Slayer to me is the coolest band on the planet. There is a timeless quality to Slayer. It's cool, but I can't explain it. It's our life.\"\nSlayer has created one mesmerizing record after the next, has influenced many of today's most successful bands, including Slipknot, Sepultura, Killswitch Engage, and continues to earn new generations of fans, while staying true to its ceaselessly devoted followers. Slayer's legacy is cemented in music forever and the band remains undaunted in its directive to make punishing, aggressive and exciting music. With Christ Illusion the band marks its territory. Slayer has exceeded itself far beyond thrash metal to become an unstoppable juggernaut without equal.\nTom Araya sums it up: \"I think the best thing is the band's longevity and the fact that we haven't bowed to anyone. That we were able to make a record like Reign In Blood, which, to us, was just another record, but to others, was something very special, it's had such an impact. People will remember it for a long time, and it's all because we did things our way, we didn't bow down to anyone. We didn't compromise. We stuck to being who we are.\"\n\n","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"California","genre":"Metal\/Thrash\/Hardcore","hometown":"USA\/California","is_published":true,"record_label":"American\/Sony BMG","talking_about_count":47419,"username":"slayer","website":"www.slayer.net www.myspace.com\/slayer www.twitter.com\/SlayerBand www.slatanicwehrmacht.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"12019910389","name":"Slayer band","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/slayer","likes":4036660,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151887097520390","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/994829_10151887097520390_986793615_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"category":"Musician\/band","description":"Billie Joe Armstrong is an American musician, singer, songwriter and occasional actor. He is best known as the lead vocalist, principal songwriter, and guitarist of the punk rock band Green Day, which Armstrong co-founded with Mike Dirnt. He is also a guitarist and vocalist for the punk rock band Pinhead Gunpowder and provides lead vocals for Green Day's side projects Foxboro Hot Tubs and The Network.Raised in Rodeo, California, Armstrong developed an interest in music at a young age, and recorded his first song at the age of five. He met Mike Dirnt while attending elementary school, and the two instantly bonded over their mutual interest in music, forming the band Sweet Children when the two were 15 years old. The band changed its name to Green Day, and would later achieve massive commercial success. Armstrong has also pursued musical projects outside of Green Day's work, including numerous collaborations with other musicians.He also co-owns the record label Adeline Records, with his wife Adrienne and skateboarder Jim Thiebaud, with the collaboration of Green Day's guitarist Jason White and more recently Green Day's manager Pat Magnarella.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":771,"website":"http:\/\/www.recordmecca.com\/view_item.aspx?id=82","were_here_count":0,"id":"113828285294157","name":"Billie Joe Armstrong","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Billie-Joe-Armstrong\/113828285294157","likes":193239}

{"about":"Download The Xmas EP on iTunes now! http:\/\/bit.ly\/nsn-xmas-ep","band_members":"Christofer Drew - Vocals, Guitar, Keys\nTaylor MacFee - Bass, Vocals\nHayden Kaiser -Drums, Guitar, Vocals\n","bio":" THE OFFICIAL NEVER SHOUT NEVER FACEBOOK PAGE\n-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -\nNever Shout Never has been reborn. While the moniker has long referred to 20-year-old Christofer Drew, it is now the name of a full band with the messy-haired singer-songwriter at its helm \u2013 and the change couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.\u201d\n\nWith six EPs and two albums under his belt, over 2.5 million Facebook fans, nearly 50 million MySpace profile views and over 157 million song plays, it\u2019s clear that Drew has achieved breakthrough success since his first upload. However, the talented guitarist experienced some dark moments following the release of his Butch Vig-produced album, Harmony, becoming \u201ca little bitter towards the music industry\u201d and left shaken by the breakup from his girlfriend of almost two years. But, through his search for a higher consciousness, he found a path of enlightenment that led to a whole new outlook on music and life.\n\nIn an almost therapeutic way, Drew has woven his experiences into Time Travel, the first album recorded and produced by Never Shout Never, which now includes Drew, Caleb Denison (guitar\/drums\/percussion), Taylor MacFee (bass) and Hayden Kaiser (guitar, percussion). The band members, who each contributed backing vocals on the full-length, holed up in Springfield, MO, just one hour outside of their hometown of Joplin, and dedicated themselves to making Never Shout Never\u2019s most impressive album to date.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of been a long time coming,\u201d Drew says. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted Never Shout to be a band, but I\u2019ve always had other people telling me that it\u2019s my thing and I need to keep taking pictures by myself and stuff. But I\u2019m at a point now where I found my core group of guys, and I would much rather go in with this new fresh outlook and as a group instead of focusing all on me. It\u2019s going to be awesome having personalities in the group, because we\u2019re all such different people, but at the same time, we all stand for and represent the same thing.\u201d\n\nTime Travel embodies a lush sound with fuller instrumentation, and, as Drew explains, the songs have a more experimental quality. \u201cI wanted to make this album more of a little concept,\u201d he says. \u201cI just wanted it to be different than anything that we\u2019ve done; I wanted it to be a little more trippy. I\u2019ve always thought that it would be awesome to travel through time. I watch a lot of the History channel.\u201d\u201d\n\nPart of the album\u2019s \u201ctrippy\u201d nature comes from Drew\u2019s newfound affinity for dance and meditation music. \u201cFor a while, I was kind of getting pretentious about the whole music thing,\u201d he laments. \u201cI was only listening to Dylan and like pre-\u201870s kind of stuff, and I thought anything else was kind of bullshit, but I got my eyes opened up. I went on a trip out to California for a month and got super into the rave scene, and understood that there\u2019s more to life than pretending to be Bob Dylan. I learned a lot about myself.\u201d.\n\nAlthough many changes are happening in Drew\u2019s life, fans will undoubtedly follow their fearless leader in whichever direction he takes. Since the age of 16, audiences have watched him grow from a one-man show to a far-reaching phenomenon. To what does the tattooed rocker attribute his success? Simply being himself. \u201cI\u2019ve just been really genuine with everyone,\u201d he explains. \u201cEven when I was at my darkest places, I still tried to be super genuine. I think people appreciate that it\u2019s been about real music and true expression.\u201d\n\nThis LP, or \u201crebirth album,\u201d as Drew likes to call it, kicks off with the epic title track, which was most inspired by Drew\u2019s new-age influences. \u201cSilver Ecstasy\u201d was written by Denison, and is the first song on a Never Shout Never album that was not penned by Drew. \u201cGetaway,\u201d he says, is about \u201cdiving into a daydream with her and leaving it all behind for a little bit,\u201d and was inspired by the stresses and drama of Drew\u2019s breakup. \u201cRobots\u201d also focuses on a girl, but in this song, Drew is numb to her. \u201cIt\u2019s just about being emotionless,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cLost at Sea\u201d is the album closer, which Drew wrote when he was having a \u201cmental breakdown.\u201d He explains, \u201cI was home alone; no one was around. I didn\u2019t know what else to do, so I grabbed my guitar and wrote this song. Whenever I say \u2018lost at sea,\u2019 it\u2019s a metaphor for when I lose my mind. Like, if I lose my mind and never come back the same tell everyone that I\u2019ll miss them, but I had to go. Pretty depressing, but at the same time a pretty cool tune.\u201d\n\nSince his last record, Drew has matured and been able to tap into a self-awareness that has ultimately helped him deal with his inner conflicts. \u201cI\u2019ve had this weird thing where I\u2019ve almost dreaded success because I felt undeserving deep in my subconscious, but now I\u2019m to this point where I\u2019m accepting success and prepared for it, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt that before,\u201d he reveals. \u201cAnd whatever happens, happens. I just want to be genuine and stand for a normal dude in the industry and not let it get to me.\u201d\n\nAs for the future, Never Should Never simply want to continue making records, playing live shows, experimenting with sound and \u201chopefully let people know that we\u2019re here to have fun with music, not just to make money.\u201d Drew adds, \u201cWe want to go at it like the same way that Queen did \u2013 just awesome experimental records, but making some great hits at the same time. We don\u2019t want to have any limits.\u201d\n\nChristofer Drew and Never Shout Never continue to help raise money for their hometown of Joplin, MO which was devastated by tornados in late May. Christofer put together a campaign with the United Way in hopes to raise $1 million for Joplin. Text \u201cJOMO\u201d to 50555 to donate $10 to the immediate and long-term relief of Joplin, MO and watch the video of the destruction Chris put together himself, which also contains a clip of \u201cTime Travel.\u201d\n","booking_agent":"Paradigm \/ Matt Galle- xstandx\u0040aol.com -- Mike Marquis - mikemarquis\u0040gmail.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Joplin, MO","general_manager":"Danny Rukasin \/ Danny\u0040workinggroupmgmt.com    Dirk Hemsath \/ Dirk\u0040workinggroupmgmt.com","genre":"New Age","hometown":"Joplin, MO","is_published":true,"record_label":"Loveway Records","talking_about_count":15727,"username":"nevershoutnever","website":"www.nevershoutnever.com www.nevershoutnever.com\/shop www.myspace.com\/nevershoutnever www.purevolume.com\/nevershoutnever www.twitter.com\/christoferdrew www.twitter.com\/NSNofficial http:\/\/apps.facebook.com\/harmony-garden\/ http:\/\/wbr.fm\/pingNSN http:\/\/wbr.fm\/NSNRingtones http:\/\/nevershoutnever.com.br\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"19266902926","name":"Never Shout Never","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nevershoutnever","likes":3787639,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151670604907927","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1376463_10151670604907927_1513499587_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"category":"Musician\/band","description":"Everything is an alternative rock band from Harrisonburg, Virginia best known for their 1998 hit \"Hooch\".HistoryThe band was formed in 1989 by students at James Madison University. Going on the road full-time in '92, they played 200-250 shows a year for nearly the next 10 years, starting in the mid-Atlantic, and then gradually expanding their grass roots fan base until it extended across half of the U.S. The band released its first 3 albums independently, selling almost 30,000 CDs before signing a brief and ill-fated deal with Capricorn Records in 1995.Larger scale success came when they signed with indie label Blackbird who funded the recording of the Super Natural album, and whose uplift venture with Sire\/London eventually provided the radio and distribution muscle that got the breaking single \"Hooch\" to top radio stations around the world. Their peak of popularity came in 1998, when \"Hooch\" (from the Super Natural album) was featured in Adam Sandler's hit movie The Waterboy. From 1998 to 2000, it charted in the top 10 on Billboard's Pop and Hot AC charts, as well as top 20 on the Modern Rock charts. The band reveled in their 'new-found' popularity, playing radio shows and festival crowds around the country. \"Hooch\" has been heard in episodes of My Name Is Earl, Yes, Dear, and Clueless, and also was featured on the Scrubs Vol. 1 Soundtrack.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":168,"website":"http:\/\/www.thebandeverything.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"112198812128701","name":"Everything","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Everything\/112198812128701","likes":1436239}

{"about":"My new album #TalkAGoodGame available for purchase here: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/KellyRTAGGDlxExiT","band_members":"Kelly Rowland","bio":"For a Grammy-award winner who has been part of one of the most successful groups of all time, a solo star in her own right, with roles in motion pictures and television, Kelly Rowland isn\u2019t kidding when she says, \u201cThis is a fresh start for me. I\u2019m in a fantastic place right now.\u201d\n\nWith brand-new management, a new record label and a world-wide hit, \u201cWhen Love Takes Over,\u201d with acclaimed French dance producer David Guetta, call this new phase, \u201cWhen Kelly Takes Over,\u201d as the multi-talented singer\/songwriter\/TV host and actress exerts full control on a career that has already produced millions of album sales, smash records and accolades.\n\nAfter spending a summer in Europe, Rowland found herself turned on to different sounds and musical genres, especially dance and electro, which has encouraged her latest stylistic direction.\n\n\u201cI went out and had great experiences learning about the culture of dance music, how people interact with the DJ,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really inspired my sound moving forward.\u201d\n\nKelly launched her post-Destiny\u2019s Child solo career by teaming up with rapper Nelly in 2002, recording the vocals for the track \u201cDilemma\u201d for his album Nellyville. The song ended up with a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year and earned Rowland an award in the Best Rap\/Sung Collaboration category.\n\nAfter two successful solo albums\u20142002\u2019s RIAA-gold certified Simply Deep, which reached #12 on the Billboard chart, and 2007\u2019s Ms. Kelly, featuring top producers like Billy Mann, Scott Storch, Sean Garrett, Tank, Rockwilder and Polow da Don, and guest stars Snoop Dogg and Eve, going on to sell 1.2 million worldwide\u2014Rowland found herself ready for a change of pace. One of the singles from Ms. Kelly, \u201cWork,\u201d offered a hint of her new direction, when a dance remix hit the Top 10 in France, Italy and the U.K.\n\n\u201cWhen the Freemasons did their thing, it became this massive international hit,\u201d explains Kelly. \u201cTo be quite honest, I was a little nervous about doing it, but when I met David, I realized how much I was enjoying dance music.\u201d\n\nPlaying the same club in the south of France, Rowland and Guetta hit it off straight away. He played her one of his tracks, which Kelly took back with her to London, and finished writing what became \u201cWhen Loves Takes Over\u201d with Mim and Liv of the production\/ songwriting team Nervo, whom she had just met for the first time. She sent it back to David, and the rest can be heard on club floors all over the world.\n\n\u201cHalf the time, I don\u2019t even have to sing the words,\u201d marvels Kelly at the reaction of dancers to the hit. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun record. It feels good. For so long, I\u2019ve been saying I wanted to do a record that I could be me on.\u201d\n\nWhile \u201cWhen Loves Takes Over,\u201d which has already topped the charts throughout Europe, appears on Guetta\u2019s new album, One Love, Kelly and the DJ\/producer\/songwriter will reprise their collaboration on her own third solo effort, which she has begun to record in L.A., New York and Miami, where she makes her home.\n\n\u201cYes, he will definitely be a part of it,\u201d nods Kelly. \u201cWe have started thinking about what we want to do and I know in my gut, it\u2019s going to be fantastic. Our chemistry in the studio and on-stage is so good. It just works.\u201d\n\nAside from Guetta, Rowland has already begun working with a variety of European producers, including up-and-comers like Calvo and Fredro Odesjo, as well as U.S. hitmakers like producer\/songwriter Brian Kennedy (\u201cDisturbia\u201d).\n\n\u201cThese guys are really creative, excited about dance music and understand it,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cI want to incorporate those sounds without going too far away from what people know me for, which is R&amp;B. I\u2019ve traveled the world as a solo artist and have been influenced by all these different sounds\u2014Europop, electro, dance, etc.\u2014that I want to share with my fans. I\u2019d like my audience to get to know me better on this album, discover my personality\u2014which is sass and class, the fun part. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to showcase.\u201d\n\nAs for her illustrious past, Kelly just wants room to grow as an individual, to explore her own artistic path.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about respecting me in my space as an individual, as I respect the other members of Destiny\u2019s Child in theirs,\u201d she insists. \u201cThat is certainly a large part of my career, how big it was. We continue to love and support each other, but we\u2019re all adults moving forward.\u201d\n\nRowland is also intent on continuing to appear on TV and in the movies. She had a recurring role in the UPN sitcom The Hughleys, before appearing in other network shows such as Eve and Girlfriends. She also appeared as Martha Reeves in American Dreams, singing \u201cNowhere to Run.\u201d In 2003, Rowland made her big screen debut in the film Freddy vs. Jason, then the following year starred in the romantic comedy, The Seat Filler, executive-produced by Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, playing a pop star who falls for an awards-show seat filler she mistakes for a high-profile record executive. She just finished co-hosting Bravo\u2019s reality series The Fashion Show with designer Isaac Mizrahi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely going up for more roles because it\u2019s something I truly enjoy,\u201d she says. \u201cI really want to continue to study the craft to where I can be respected as an actor. I want to completely understand the role and get engrossed in it to the point where I am that character. For me, it\u2019s about passion, not taking a role just to say I did it.\u201d\n\nWith a clean slate and a promising start on this latest phase of her impressive career, Kelly is ready to embark on this latest phase of her career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident in everyone that\u2019s around me now,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe in them as much, if not more, than they believe in me. I let them know what\u2019s going on, what I want, what I expect from them. I\u2019m in control, and that\u2019s a great thing.\u201d\n\nNow that she\u2019s set in the present, Kelly has no problem casting an eye toward the future.\n\n\u201cI want to put together a great #1 album and tour, just play live, be with the crowd and create more of those magic moments,\u201d she concludes, before adding she\u2019s working on creating her own TV show, one which she wouldn\u2019t mind being behind the camera for a change.\n\nNow that \u201cLove\u201d has taken over, Kelly Rowland won\u2019t be far behind.","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Miami, FL","hometown":"Houston,TX","is_published":true,"record_label":"Republic Records","talking_about_count":522260,"username":"kellyrowland","website":"www.kellyrowland.com\/ ","were_here_count":0,"id":"5485793674","name":"Kelly Rowland","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kellyrowland","likes":4727631,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152010964023675","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1452390_10152010964023675_860420836_n.png","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Keyshia\u2019s third album, A Different Me \u2013 Executive Produced by Keyshia, Manager Manny Halley and Geffen Records Chairman Ron Fair is set for release on Tuesday, December 16, 2008.\n\nKEYSHIA COLE is the definitive soul singer to emerge in this decade, and she is in good company. Over the past seven decades, precious few R & B females have touched the hearts of America. From Billie Holiday to Sarah Vaughn, Dinah Washington, Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Gladys Knight, Whitney Houston, and Mary J. Blige - Keyshia possesses the same innate quality of telling the truth through song like her predecessors. Her pain becomes your pain, her joy, your joy.\n\nHer first single, \u201cPlaya Cardz Right\u201d featuring Tupac (an early mentor of Cole\u2019s) has already garnered a top 15 chart position in its first three weeks. This single follows a host of seven (7) number one (#1) records that include \u201cI Should Have Cheated;\u201d \u201cLove,\u201d \u201cLet it Go,\u201d \u201cI Remember,\u201d \u201cHeaven Sent,\u201d \u201cLast Night\u201d (w\/P.

The Cole\u2019s adopted her after her mother Frankie, an addict at the time, could no longer take care of her. Twenty plus years later, she is still trying to put all of the pieces of the puzzle we call life together \u2013 discovering long lost siblings, mending the relationship with her mother who was recently released from jail and supporting her sister, Neffe, and her four children.\n\nThe road to riches wasn\u2019t easy for Keyshia and still isn\u2019t.

{"about":"Official Facebook Page for Lemmy Kilmister of Mot\u00f6rhead! www.imotorhead.com ","category":"Musician\/band","is_published":true,"personal_info":"Motorhead - the name alone stands on it's own, a band that lives according to their own rules. A band that has never sacrificed anything and has always remained true to what they are. Lemmy Kilmister, Phil Campbell and Mikkey Dee - what you see is what you get! Lemmy's enthronement as an Icon of Rock happened a while ago and proves that Rock and Roll is alive and exhilarating. (On June 16th Lemmy received the Mojo Icon Award).\n\nFans, new and old, have been bowing to and worshipping Motorhead for over 30 years. Fellow musicians - like Dave Grohl, Ozzy Osbourne ,The Ramones, Guns N' Roses & Metallica have all paid tribute to the Motorhead legend - in one way or another.\n\nLemmy is the undisputed head, gruff and with the typical British humour (despite calling L.A. his home for more than 18 years). Phil Campbell, who has been with the band since 1984, is like a fine red wine - getting better each year, while Mikkey Dee (with the band since 1992) is described by Lemmy as follows: 'Mikkey is fantastic, he's 100\u0025 sure of himself, and knows he's the best drummer in the world. The infamous 'We Are Motorhead And Play Rock'n Roll' trio is still a power-horse that won't slow down. More and more people are enthralled by their music and personalities.\n\nMotorhead is without a doubt one of the most respected rock bands in the world and made it clear to everyone when they finally received a well deserved Grammy in 2005 for Best Metal Performance.\n\n'Motorizer', a meaty, dangerous rock record, is Motorhead's 24th album and as you can hear - the band is always good for surprises! One gets the feeling that they have not yet reached the peak of their musical output. Like Mikkey Dee says: 'A kick ass motherf***ing record - definitely one of the wider ranged Motorhead records ever released'.\n\n'Motorizer' delivers 11 brilliant brand new songs in a never before Motorhead variety, ready to rock the house. The album was again produced by Cameron Webb (Social Distortion, Zebrahead, Papa Roach & Pennywise), who produced the last two Motorhead releases, and much of the recording took place at FooFighter Dave Grohl's 606 studios in Los Angeles.\n\nListen to the record, this band is more than alive and kickin'. Here\u00d5s the tracklisting:\n\n(Teach You How To) Sing The Blues \/ Time Is Right \/ Heroes \/ Runaround Man \/ English Rose \/ Rock Out \/ 1000 Names \/ When The Eagle Screams \/ Don\u00d5t Die Ashamed \/ Back On The Chain \/ Buried Alive\n\nHaving completed a highly successful tour of the US last year with Judas Priest and Heaven & Hell, Motorhead continue to answer the global demand for their live assault in 2009. A sold-out tour of South America took place in April, the band is currently in Europe playing some of the summer's biggest festivals, and they will return to the US in September for a real rock'n'roll bill with The Reverend Horton Heat and Nashville Pussy. Without taking a breath, they will then return to Europe for indoor dates throughout the continent, with support from eternally cool cohorts The Damned and Girlschool. In the spring of 2010, the band will commence work on their as-yet untitled new album.

Goodie Mob released their 1st album \u201cSoul Food\u201d in 1995, pioneering them to the top of the emerging Southern rap scene. The Southern Hip Hop group then released two more albums \u201cStill Standing\u201d (1998), and \u201cWorld Party\u201d (1999). After CeeLo\u2019s success with Goodie Mob, he reinvented himself and formed Gnarls Barkley with deejay-producer Danger Mouse to release the 2006 worldwide hit \u201cCrazy\u201d, which reached #1 in various singles charts worldwide. In the US, \u201cCrazy\u201d reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Following Gnarls Barkley, Green put his time back into his solo career as CeeLo Green and released the 2010 album \u201cThe Lady Killer\u201d, which featured his hit single \u201cForget You\u201d.  \n\nOn a personal note, CeeLo Green grew up in Atlanta, GA. Both of his parents were ordained ministers and he started his music career in church. His father died when he was just two years old and his mother, Sheila J. Callaway, a volunteer firefighter, was in a fatal car accident and died when he was 18. His mother and grandmother were both very involved in various philanthropic efforts and to continue his family legacy, CeeLo and his sister Shedonna launched GreenHouse Foundation in August 2012, a non-profit organization with a mission to help make \u201cgreen education\u201d easier and accessible to students in underserved school districts.\n","booking_agent":"Cara Lewis \/ Creative Artists Agency, clewisgroup\u0040caa.com, 212-738-7838","category":"Musician\/band","description":"The OFFICIAL Facebook Page of CeeLo Green","general_manager":"Larry Mestel (Primary Wave Talent Management)  \/ management\u0040primarywavemusic.com","genre":"Pop \/ Soul","hometown":"Atlanta, Georgia","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Anne Watkins (Primary Wave Music)  (212) 584-8065 ","record_label":"Elektra Records ","talking_about_count":17465,"username":"ceelogreen","website":"http:\/\/www.CeeloGreen.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"129330203770942","name":"CeeLo Green","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ceelogreen","likes":1838845,"cover":{"cover_id":445148285522464,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/548437_445148285522464_1563331351_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

Debut album Leisure (1991) announced the arrival of a band with pop suss warped by an art-punk eccentricity. Yet Blur had more in them: namely, a revolution in the sound of English popular music. Second album Modern Life Is Rubbish reintroduced the idea that English rock music could be cool, and by the time their third album Parklife emerged in 1994, the rest of the UK had caught up. \n \nThe Great Escape (1995) refined the sound palette of Britpop, but Blur were already moving on. 1997's Blur was an about-face - scuffed and noisy and un-English. Follow-up 13 was an even a more radical adventure in sound as William Orbit refereed a truce between organic punkpop and new-fangled technology.\n \nSeventh album Think Tank (2003) was Blur\u2019s first as a three piece after the temporary departure of founding guitarist Graham Coxon, featuring an eclectic variety of rhythms and textures and glorious melodies. \n \nIn 2009 Blur reconvened as a four-piece to play a series of UK shows including two sold out dates at Hyde Park and a historic Sunday night appearance at Glastonbury.

Yoko and me. And that's reality.","band_members":"John Lennon","bio":"If John Lennon had only been one of the four members of the Beatles, his artistic immortality would already have been assured. The so-called \u201csmart Beatle,\u201d he brought a penetrating intelligence and a stinging wit both to the band\u2019s music and its self-presentation. But in such songs as \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever,\u201d \u201cNorwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),\u201d \u201cRain\u201d and \u201cIn My Life,\u201d he also marshaled gorgeous melodies to evoke a sophisticated, dreamlike world-weariness well beyond his years. Such work suggested not merely a profound musical and literary sensibility \u2013 a genius, in short \u2014 but a vision of life that was simultaneously reflective, utopian and poignantly realistic.\n\nWhile in the Beatles, Lennon displayed an outspokenness that immersed the band in controversy and helped redefine the rules of acceptable behavior for rock stars. He famously remarked in 1965 that the Beatles were \u201cmore popular than Jesus\u201d \u2013 a statement that was more an observation than a boast, but that resulted in the band\u2019s records being burned and removed from radio station playlists in the U.S. He criticized America\u2019s involvement in Vietnam, and, as the Sixties progressed, he became an increasingly important symbol of the burgeoning counterculture.\n\nBut it was only after the breakup of the Beatles in 1970 that the figure the world now recognizes as \u201cJohn Lennon\u201d truly came into being. Whether he was engaging in social activism; giving long, passionate interviews that, once again, broadened the nature of public discourse for artists; defining a new life as a self-described \u201chousehusband;\u201d or writing and recording songs, Lennon came to view his life as a work of art in which every act shimmered with potential meaning for the world at large. It was a Messianic attitude, to be sure, but one that was tempered by an innate inclusiveness and generosity. If he saw himself as larger than life, he also yearned for a world in which his ego managed at once to absorb everyone else and dissolve all differences among people, leaving a Zen-like tranquility and calm. \u201cYou may say I\u2019m a dreamer, but I\u2019m not the only one,\u201d he sang in \u201cImagine,\u201d which has become his best-known song and an international anthem of peace. \u201cI hope someday you\u2019ll join us, and the world will live as one.\u201d\n\nSuch imagery, coupled with the tragedy of his murder in 1980, has often led to Lennon\u2019s being sentimentalized as a gentle prince of peace gazing off into the distance at an Eden only he could see. In fact, he was a far more complex and difficult person, which, in part, accounts for the world\u2019s endless fascination with him. Plastic Ono Band (1970), the first solo album he made after leaving the Beatles, alternates songs that are so emotionally raw that to this day they are difficult to listen to with songs of extraordinary beauty and simplicity. Gripped by his immersion in primal-scream therapy, which encouraged its practitioners to re-experience their most profound psychic injuries, Lennon sought in such songs as \u201cMother\u201d and \u201cGod\u201d to confront and strip away the traumas that had afflicted his life since childhood.\n\nAnd those traumas were considerable. Lennon\u2019s mother, Julia, drifted in and out of his life during his childhood in Liverpool \u2013 he was raised by Julia\u2019s sister Mimi and Mimi\u2019s husband, George \u2013 and then died in a car accident when Lennon was seventeen. His father was similarly absent, essentially walking out on the family when John was an infant. He disappeared for good when Lennon was five, only to return after his son had become famous as a member of the Beatles. Consequently, Lennon struggled with fears of abandonment his entire life. When he repeatedly cries, \u201cMama, don\u2019t go\/Daddy come home,\u201d in \u201cMother,\u201d it\u2019s less a performance than a scarifying brand of therapeutic performance art. And in that regard, as well as many others, it revealed the influence of Yoko Ono, whom Lennon had married in 1969, leaving his first wife, Cynthia, and their son Julian in order to do so.\n\nThe minimalist sound of Plastic Ono Band was significant too. Lennon had come to associate the elaborate musical arrangements of much of the Beatles\u2019 later work with Paul McCartney and George Martin, and he consciously set out to purge those elements from his own work. Co-producing with Ono and the legendary Phil Spector, he built a sonic environment that could not have been more basic \u2013 guitar, bass, drums, the occasional piano \u2014 whatever was essential and absolutely nothing more. Lyrically, he turned away from the psychedelic flights and Joycean wordplay of such songs as \u201cI Am the Walrus\u201d and \u201cLucy in the Sky With Diamonds\u201d \u2013 as well as his books, In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works \u2014 and toward a style in which unadorned, elemental speech gathered poetic force through its very directness.\n\nOn his next album, Imagine (1971), Lennon felt confident enough to reintroduce some melodic elements reminiscent of the Beatles into his songs. Working again with Ono and Spector, he retains the eloquent plainspokenness of Plastic Ono Band, but allows textural elements such as strings, to create more of a sense of beauty. The album\u2019s title track alone ensured its historical importance; it is a call to idealism that has provided solace and inspiration at every moment of social and humanitarian crisis since it was written.\n\nFrom there Lennon turned to a style that was a sort of journalistic agit-prop. Sometime In New York City (1972) is as outward-looking and blunt as Imagine was, for the most part, soft-focused and otherworldly. As its title suggests, the album reflects Lennon\u2019s immersion in the drama and noise of the city to which he had moved with Yoko Ono. And as its cover art suggests, the album is something like a newspaper \u2013 a report from the radical frontlines on the political upheavals of the day. His activism would create enormous problems for Lennon, however. The Nixon administration, paranoid about the possibility that a former Beatle might become a potent leader and recruiting tool of the anti-war movement, attempted to have Lennon deported. Years of legal battles ensued before Lennon finally was awarded his green card in 1976.\n\nLennon\u2019s political struggles unfortunately found their match in his personal life. He and Ono split up in the fall of 1973, shortly before the release of his album, Mind Games. He moved to Los Angeles and later described the eighteen months he spent separated from Ono as his \u201clost weekend,\u201d a period of wild indulgence and artistic drift. Like Mind Games, the albums he made during this period, Walls and Bridges (1974) and Rock N Roll (1975), are the expressions of a major artist seeking, with mixed results, to recover his voice. None of them lack charm, and their high points include the lovely title track of Mind Games; Walls and Bridges\u2019 \u201cWhatever Gets You Through the Night,\u201d a rollicking duet with Elton John that gave Lennon his first number-one single as a solo artist; and the sweet nostalgia of Rock N Roll, a covers album that was Lennon\u2019s tribute to the musical pioneers of his youth. But none of those albums rank among his greatest work.\n\nIn 1975, Lennon reunited with Ono, and their son Sean was born later that year. For the next five years, Lennon withdrew from public life, and his family became his focus. Then, in 1980, he and Ono returned to the studio to work on Double Fantasy, a hymn to their life together with Sean. The couple was plotting a full-fledged comeback \u2013 doing major interviews to support the album\u2019s release, recording new songs for a follow-up, planning a tour. Then, shockingly, Lennon was shot to death outside the apartment building where he and Ono lived on the night of December 8, 1980.\n\n\u2013\u2013Anthony DeCurtis\n","category":"Musician\/band","description":"70th Birthday Competition! http:\/\/bit.ly\/70thcompetition\n\nSign up for John Lennon news: http:\/\/bit.ly\/LennonList\n\nwww.johnlennon.com www.johnlennoncatalogue.com","hometown":"Liverpool","influences":"Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Gene Vincent, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Lonnie Donegan, Lewis Carroll, The Goons, Julia Lennon, Mimi Smith, Liverpool, Paul McCartney, Yoko Ono","is_published":true,"record_label":"Apple, Geffen, EMI","talking_about_count":29598,"username":"johnlennon","website":"http:\/\/www.johnlennon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/www.johnlennoncatalogue.com\nhttp:\/\/www.imaginepeace.com\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/johnlennon\n","were_here_count":0,"id":"135388936479828","name":"John Lennon","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/johnlennon","likes":13996885,"cover":{"cover_id":707053912646658,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1441456_707053912646658_1139927731_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Michael's new album \u2018To Be Loved\u2019 is available now: http:\/\/bit.ly\/14CmtHf\n\n","band_members":"Michael Buble","bio":"\u201cTO BE LOVED\u201d BY MICHAEL BUBLE\u00b4\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the best album I\u2019ve ever made\u2026I know every artist on earth says that when their new album is coming out but really - this time it\u2019s true. I swear. You can ask my mother.  But don\u2019t take my word for it or my mom\u2019s.  Play it yourself and you\u2019ll see and hear I\u2019m telling the honest truth.  I want to take you on a wonderful journey about love \u2013 all different kinds of love.  The album swings big time \u2013 it rocks \u2013 it\u2019s soulful \u2013 it\u2019s happy \u2013sometimes a little sad - it\u2019s romantic \u2013 it\u2019s yummy and it\u2019s heartfelt.\n  \nDo not think I take my success these last ten years for granted.  I was anything but an overnight sensation which inspires me to deliver big time for my fans \u2013 maybe even make some new ones this time out.   Trust me, there\u2019s no sitting back, no dialing in for me.  I labored over every song, every note and every arrangement because I can\u2019t resist trying to make each record better than my last one. It helps that I\u2019m pretty happy in my life at the moment and feel that I\u2019ve really grown a lot as a songwriter and interpreter of great songs.   On \u201cTo Be Loved\u201d I felt a new sense of  freedom to create and kind of take things further \u2013 maybe take a few risks and dig deep to find some gems.\n\nFor starters I wrote four songs \u2013 twice as many as on my previous record.  Once again, I wrote with my usual great collaborators including my musical director Alan Chang, Amy Foster Giles and Jann Arden.  I also wrote with my fellow Canadian - the great Bryan Adams, eh...Little aside here\u2026 The first album I ever bought was \u201cReckless in 1985\u201d by Bryan Adams.  He was such a big hero of mine and still is.  Imagine how thrilling it was to write with him and then go into the studio and record \u201cAfter All\u201d the song we wrote together. \n\nThe first single, \u201cIt\u2019s A Beautiful Day\u201d is what I\u2019d call an \u201canti-love\u201d song \u2013 maybe a kind of revenge song.  It sounds like a really happy song but if you listen closely it\u2019s a song for all of us (yes I include myself) who have been dumped but realize that it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened because life is beautiful out there and sometimes when your heart is broken you forget that.   I\u2019ve been the jerk in a relationship and have been on the receiving end of a break up so I have a good perspective.  I\u2019d describe the song as the good and the bad of love.  Another song I\u2019m pretty proud of which I also co-wrote is \u201cClose Your Eyes\u201d.   I wrote it about my wife and about the power of all the women in my life \u2013 my sisters, my mom, my grandma and all women in general.  Let\u2019s face it, where would we be without them?  Some men may disagree, but I think we\u2019re definitely not the stronger sex.  \u201cI Got It Easy,\u201d another original, is basically a song where I count my blessings and is a reminder to me and everyone to appreciate all the good parts of life.   I\u2019m a very lucky guy and I never want to forget it.\n\nAs for the selection of standards, I wanted to cover songs from artists that I\u2019ve loved and who have inspired me over the years\u2026The Bee Gees \u201cTo Love Somebody\u201d, \u201cWho\u2019s Lovin\u2019 You\u201d by the Jackson Five and the title song, \u201cTo Be Loved\u201d originally recorded by Jackie Wilson have all been huge favorites of mine and it\u2019s exciting to think that I can remind people how timeless these songs and introduce them to new generations.  I\u2019ve talked about my worship for Elvis Presley over the years and gave \u201cHave I Told You Lately\u201d extra love.  \n \nI\u2019ve been a big fan of Reese Witherspoon for a long time and thought her performance as June Carter Cash was incredible.  I was thrilled beyond belief when she agreed to sing the Nancy and Frank Sinatra classic \u201cSomething Stupid\u201d with me.  She was a dream to work with and we\u2019re both so happy with the way the song came out.  I hope she\u2019ll sing it with me on stage one day.  I recorded the great Randy Newman song from \u201cToy Story  - \u201cYou\u2019ve Got A Friend In Me\u201d because I often feel like I\u2019m still ten years old and I love the sentiment of that song.  Who can\u2019t relate to that message?  Doesn\u2019t matter what your age is.\n\nI think the song \u201cNevertheless\u201d is one of the most beautiful ones on this record.. I was helped immensely by the great Puppini Sisters. Be warned their harmonies on this can make a person swoon - be warned.  \u201cCome Dance With Me\u201d \u2013 well I went totally wild with this song.  I can\u2019t wait to sing this one live with my band behind me.   I think it will be a show stopper.  I know my fans will be dancing in the aisles to this one.  You cannot sit still when you hear it.  And that\u2019s exactly what I wanted to do with this one.\n\nMy album opens with \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young\u201d and closes with the classic \u201cYoung At Heart\u201d.  The sentiment and message of both songs are quite similar.  \u201cYou Make Me Feel So Young\u201d is surely one of the happiest songs I\u2019ve ever recorded.. We took the arrangement and really made it swing.  It\u2019s pure joy.  I\u2019ve sung the song for years but it\u2019s taken on new meaning for me now as I\u2019m about to become a parent for the first time.  \u201cYoung At Heart\u201d is my love letter to  Mr. Sinatra and his early years on Columbia Records.  I tried to honor him with this version and for those who still like to listen to an album from beginning to end, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s the message I leave people with when the music ends.  It\u2019s all about hope.  \u201cLife gets more exciting with each passing day\u2026 Love is either in your heart or on its way.\u201d  That\u2019s what I call a perfect philosophy to have about life.\n\nAnd for the people who buy my record at Target, there are some special treats including the Phil Spector classic \u201cBe My Baby\u201d with that great \u201cwall of sound\u201d.  There\u2019s also an ultra-romantic version of a long time favorite of mine and my grandpa\u2019s, \u201cMelancholy Baby.\u201d  When I was very young, I put that song on a tape and played it over and over and over. I practically feel like I wrote it.  You can\u2019t get more romantic than that song.     The Target exclusive also has a fresh and reinvented version of the \u201cBeautiful  Day\u201d single. \n\nNone of these songs would be what they were without the help of my partner in crime, the great Bob Rock who helped me realize all my dreams with the songs on \u201cTo Be Loved\u201d.  He is a producer extraordinaire and was there 1000 percent every day we were recording.  Special thanks go to the vocal talents of Naturally 7, The Puppini Sisters and The Dap Kings for perfecting the sound I was trying to create.\n\nI don\u2019t know if people even read these things so if you\u2019ve gotten this far, thank you for taking the time.  I know I sing better than I write but I wanted you to understand a little bit about what I wanted to accomplish with \u201cTo Be Loved\u201d.  I hope you love my record.   See you on the road.\u201d  Love, Michael \n","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Bruce Allen Talent","genre":"Pop\/Jazz","hometown":"British Columbia","is_published":true,"record_label":"143\/Reprise Records","talking_about_count":92772,"username":"MichaelBuble","website":"http:\/\/www.michaelbuble.com\/ http:\/\/www.bungalow-b.com\/ http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/michaelbuble http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/MichaelBuble http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/MichaelBubleTV","were_here_count":0,"id":"9053564156","name":"Michael Bubl\u00e9","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MichaelBuble","likes":6968416,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151768965354157","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/993794_10151768965354157_582674184_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"'Top 5 Dead or Alive' Coming Soon!!!--For Booking Contact Mitch Blackman - ICM Partners - mblackman\u0040icmpartners.com - 212.556.5650","bio":"Jadakiss has earned this. When you litter two decades of hip-hop with landmark verses, when you roll with some of the most formidable crews to ever huddle up in the rap game and still make a name for yourself as a solo artist, when your talent is so internationally known you can hold it down in any area code, when you\u2019ve been in the game as long as he has and still sound as fresh to death as he does, when you\u2019ve rocked the stage with Biggie and held your own, then\u2026and only then\u2026can you name your album Kiss My Ass. \n\nWith wisdom in his lyrics and feeling in his blunt smoke and liquor treated voice, Jadakiss has spent the last 10 plus years entrenching himself in the upper echelons of the rap game. And on his third solo album\u2014his first as a member of the Roc-A-Fella familia\u2014his rhymes have never sounded so potent; his voice never so evocative. \n\n\u201cPeople are always trying to redefine themselves, re-invent themselves,\u201d says Jadakiss. \u201cBut I\u2019m not selling you a lifestyle; I\u2019m not selling you rims; I\u2019m giving you my art and I\u2019m trying to entertain you. And there\u2019s value in that.\u201d \n\nKiss My Ass with it\u2019s eclectic collection of guests, producers and sounds transcends sub-genres and geography. Leave the pigeon-holes for the birds, this is simply a filler-free rap album from one of the finest pound-for-pound MC\u2019s in the game. \n\n\u201cSure, things are different out there; music sounds differently, it gets made differently and it gets listened to and talked about differently. But it\u2019s still music. And you still have to come with heat.\u201d \n\nOn Kiss My Ass, Jada\u2019s playing with fire. Whether he\u2019s keeping it all in the D-Block family with his man, Sheek, on \u201cDon\u2019t Forget Me,\u201d lacing the clubs with the likes of Pharrell and Ne-Yo on \u201cTwo Step,\u201d and \u201cBy My Side,\u201d respectively, tipping his cap to the legend he knew as a friend on, \u201cLetter to BIG\u201d or going bar for bar with Weezy on \u201cDeathwish,\u201d Jada\u2019s rhymes are always flammable objects. \n\nDon\u2019t think of the album title as some petulant shrug of the shoulders. Kiss My Ass is a mission statement from an artist equally inspired by the music of his contemporaries and frustrated by the static to noise ratio he hears in the music business. \u201cPeople get down on things, people whine on them blogs about rap...but the music of this year, with Jeezy, with Wayne, it makes me proud to put out an album this year. This has been a great year for rap and I wanted to have my say.\u201d \n\nNo conversation about the game is complete before Jadakiss says his piece. Unapologetically dedicated to his gift, Kiss My Ass is an offering to not just rap aficionados, but truly anyone that calls themselves a music lover. It\u2019s full of the frustration and anger of daily life, the joy and excess of a Saturday night and the clear-eyed contemplation of a Sunday morning. It\u2019s about what life gives and what it takes away. It\u2019s simply a portrait of an artist doing his thing at the highest level. And if you don\u2019t\u2019 like it, you know where to pucker up.

{"about":"Download Carly's new album \"Kiss\" on iTunes today! http:\/\/smarturl.it\/CarlyKiss","band_members":"Carly Rae Jepsen","bio":" \u201cI guess there\u2019s a part of you that always wants to try something a little bit different than what you\u2019ve done before,\u201d says Carly Rae Jepsen.\n\nThat\u2019s curiosity for you. It\u2019s a good instinct to have. Without it, this Vancouver-based musician would never have left her Mission, B.C. hometown for the life of a singer-songwriter -- a career that\u2019s so far produced an acclaimed debut album (2008\u2019s Tug of War), a MuchMusic Video Award nomination, two gold-certified singles (\u201cBucket,\u201d \u201cTug of War\u201d) and -- to top it all -- two 2010 Juno Award nominations for Best New Artist and Songwriter of the Year.\n\nShe also wouldn\u2019t have Curiosity. That\u2019s her new record, a collection of heart-on-sleeve pop songs about, fittingly enough, life\u2019s biggest curiosity -- love, and all the complications that come with it. Its sound -- a blend of confessional lyrics, sweet acoustic gems and straight-up pop -- is just as strangely fascinating, not least of all to Carly herself. How she stumbled upon one of its main inspirations is still something of a wonder.\n\nShe was doing what she does \u2013 writing music \u2013 when something truly curious sneaked up on her. That thing was a song called \u2013 what else? \u2013 \u201cCuriosity.\u201d Like much of her new album, it was crafted with long-time collaborator, writer\/producer Ryan Stewart, and it\u2019s about a girl (\u201cor me,\u201d she laughs) hung up on a bad boy, a guy she knows is no good, but she\u2019ll never stop thinking about. The subject is a universal push-and-pull, one the singer-songwriter even tackled on \u201cTug of War\u201d (a tune that went on to beat the likes of Nickelback to win the 2010 Canadian Radio Music Award for Song of the Year). But \u201cCuriosity\u201d came rushing out differently, with pop and snap and a bubblegum chorus harder to shake than the bad-boy she\u2019s crowing about.\n\n\u201cI was singing it in the mic, to demo it out, with these guts that I didn\u2019t know I had. And it was exciting. It was like a braver version of me that I never had experimented with before, at least not out loud to people,\u201d she says.\n\nCarly didn\u2019t know what to do about the new song. It felt so natural. She thought about it constantly -- at home in Vancouver, while doing a promotional tour of Japan, and then back again. For eight months, she and Ryan wrestled with it. She wondered: \u201cHow would this fit on my record?\u201d\n\nSure, she\u2019s always spinning the likes of La Roux, Kimbra and Dragonette on her stereo, but this is a girl whose roots are in folk. As a little girl, her dad would sing her to sleep with James Taylor classics. As a fledgling musician she ran an acoustic night at a Vancouver cafe. Even during her 2007 run on Canadian Idol she was auditioning with her own material and covering Janis Ian. And then there were all the songs she\u2019d promised herself she\u2019d showcase on album No. 2 -- jangly and cozy folk-pop creations more Natalie Imbruglia than Kylie Minogue.\n\nThose tunes are still there in force (just look to \u201cEurope\u201d or \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d). Still, Carly decided that when it came to \u201cCuriosity,\u201d it was love. Pop had just as much a place on her record as folk. Ryan was just as \u201cstoked\u201d about the song as she was -- and so, the real fun began.\n\nThe songs rushed out, a whole 35 of them written -- with most of the record made at Ryan\u2019s Wine Cellar Studios in Vancouver, then mixed by Dave \u201cRave\u201d Ogilvie (David Bowie, Nine Inch Nails, Jakalope) at Mushroom Studios. And Carly\u2019s friends and family were along for the whole process, the singer inviting them to listening sessions -- baiting them with new tunes and fresh popcorn -- so they could help her pick the sweetest of the bunch.\n\n\u201cTalk to Me\u201d finds the 25-year-old getting her flirt on in a summer song clicking with handclaps. \u201cDear Julien\u201d -- which brought Carly together with co-writer Kevin James Maher -- finds the singer in a more serious mood, writing a letter (and a song) to an ex. On the flip, \u201cJust a Step Away\u201d is, to Carly, the definition of a \u201cbeautiful old fashioned love song\u201d -- a piece she adapted from a tune her father wrote for her step-mom on their wedding day. (\u201cHe cried and loved it and it was so sweet,\u201d she says.)  \n\n\u201cBoth Sides Now,\u201d Carly\u2019s modern cover of the Joni Mitchell classic, bridges the styles she\u2019s embraced on Curiosity. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the combination that I\u2019m hoping is the theme of the album,\u201d says the self-described \u201cflower child of pop.\u201d \u201cI was definitely thinking Joni Mitchell meets dance,\u201d she says of the album\u2019s sonic palette with a giggle. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I want this record to be.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s lead single \u201cCall Me Maybe,\u201d the hit that pulses with the same jumpy energy as a new romance -- the very thing Carly\u2019s singing about. It\u2019s a track that reunited Carly with her \u201cSour Candy\u201d duet partner, old friend and tour-mate Josh Ramsay of Marianas Trench.\n\n\u201cHe was so stoked. He\u2019d been trying to get me on the pop train for years,\u201d she laughs. Since debuting in September, the single has been picked up by radio stations across the country. It started out as one of \u201ca gazillion\u201d song ideas Carly and her long-time guitarist Tavish Crowe are always tinkering on, but when Josh turned up to add his writing and production magic, the piece was completely transformed. \u201cI showed it to Josh and in no time he added crazy amounts of Josh genius to make it sound pop and I had no idea how he had done it.\u201d\n\nAnd \u201cCall Me Maybe\u201d shares something with every other song on Curiosity. Underneath the occasional wash of kick-drum and synth, these are all songs sung from the heart. \u201cIt\u2019s just me on my guitar in my bedroom writing journal entries,\u201d Carly says of her creative process. \u201cEverything is true for me in this,\u201d she explains. \u201cYou can\u2019t sing about love if you haven\u2019t felt it, and you can\u2019t sing about hurt if you haven\u2019t experienced that, too.

His father was an electric engineer who practiced his work in London, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Who played an integral role towards Hamaki\u2019s professional singing career. However Hamaki\u2019s talent was not discovered at that stage, it all goes back to his childhood as he used to sing for his school\u2019s anniversaries & celebrations. Hamaki the child had a great ability to listen to any type of music and play it on a number of instruments especially the key board.\n\nHamaki loved his music to a great level of detail and passion and from here he earned his degree in Arabic music and graduated at the Cairo academy of arts.\n\nEver since Hamaki entered the music arena he made connections with a number of composers and artists and most importantly met Tarek Madkour (One of the most respected and extremely talented Musical arrangers in the middle east, a man of huge achievements and experience with the best artists in the middle east) who took Hamaki on board and decided to support him and raise his talent to another level. Hamaki managed to introduce himself to the audience through a number of singles. Starting with a song in Lekaa el Nogoom album, followed by a single in Saaedi in the American University and Hammaam in Amsterdam albums, then he took part in the opera band Eid Ala Eid at the opening of the Nile TV channels, also Hamaki sang in another opera band with a number of famous Egyptian and Arabic stars in the El Quds Hatergaa Lena. Hamaki collaborated with Hameed ElShaery and sang a single Saaltak Habeebe in the album Bahebek ya Fairuz.\n\nAfter all these experiences and from that point it was all about shaping Hamaki the star and creating his personalized image, style and musical vision. Hamaki\u2019s focus on songs, lyrics and innovation was his ultimate aim during his pre & production process for his first ever coming album. The result was a strongly honest, soulful record \u2018Khaleena Ne\u2019eesh\u2019 where Hamaki\u2019s personality and musical influence by Tarek Madkour took place. Khaleena Ne\u2019eesh was released in 2003 where it integrated with the audience and gained lots of attention and success.\n\nSince the release of \u2018Khaleena Ne\u2019eesh\u2019 Hamaki and Madkour unfortunately had some misunderstandings and were not able to produce the second album, till 2005 they came back with a single Yana Yanta, which was filmed in Lebanon and resurfaced Hamaki\u2019s appearance and engagement with his fans.\n\nHamaki and without the existence of Tarek Madkour finally managed to produce his second album Kheles El Kalam summer 2006, after 3 years from his first album \u2018Khaleena Ne\u2019eesh\u2019. Hamaki awarded his fans what they have been longing for, a stunning hit which blew their minds off and topped their sensations. \"Kheles El Kalam\" according to the production company \"Delta Sounds\" and the fans is to be one of the most successful albums out in the market.\n\nHamaki has achieved a remarkable success with his song Ahla Haga Feeky, so he decided to shoot a video clip of the song with 6 models of 6 different Nationalities. It was directed by John Hollingsworth.\n\nAt the begining of 2008 Hamaki was back again with a CD containing three tracks of a very special single song Bahebak Kol Youm Aktar. The original track was rearranged to have another two different genres of the song. It has made a very remarkable & unique success all over The Middle East after releasing its video clip which already has been shooted in Dubai.\n\nAfter that Hamaki returned strongly with a very hot smash hit Naweeha after two years since his latest album Kheles El Kalam and he proved as alawys that he will never leave the top singer site for any other one & will not accept anything except being No.1 among the other competing singers. Naweeha Album had the priority to be on the top of high-rated albums list. It has made a very high sales score in Virgin MegaStores. It was recently anounced that The Turkish Singer \"Mostafa Sundal\" have translated the song \u2018We Eftakart\u2019 into Turkish and it was released in his lastest album. So, we can say that Naweeha Album has achieved a huge success all over the world.\n\nIn January 2009 his fifth video clip We Eftakart was shot in Romania. It was a very romantic clip and really made a remarkable success that was admitted by the vast majority of its viewers.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Mohamed Hamaki has signed a contract to conduct a propaganda campaign for Nokia company. Respectively, it is said that Nokia has chosen Hamaki as he is considered to be one of the most popular singers in the Arab world, and this may be just the launch towards spreading his songs and musical vision outside the Arab world through conducting more advertising campaigns for international companies like Nokia or what ever the company will be.\n\n\nRespectively, Mohamed Hamaki has received several awards which are mentioned in details on the Awards section.\n\nThere is no doubt that Hamaki\u2019s songs have gained alot of success all over the world and as a result, alot of singers -of different Nationalities- have translated some of his songs into many languages to be released in their albums, you can find some of them on this page.\n\nBy the way, Hamaki is not just a singer but he is also a talanted composer. Click here for more details about Hamaki (the composer).\n\nHamaki\u2019s domestic life is just as pleasing as his musical career. He cherishes and dedicates his time with his family.\n\nHamaki appreciates sport and surprisingly could have been one of the youth players in \"El Ahly\" football club, his talent should have gave him the chance but it was not written for him to continue. Hamaki yet plays football occasionally and with his musical band crew on play station.\n\nMohamed Hamaki\u2019s hard work and passion to creating quality music and new stylized musical techniques was and will continuously be his ultimate aim throughout the years.","booking_agent":"Mohamed Mamdouh","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Cairo, Egypt","description":"Full Name: Mohamed Ibrahim Mohamed El Hamaki\nDate Of Birth: 04-November-1975\nStar Sign: Scorpio\nBirthplace: Egypt\/Cairo\nHair Color: Black\nEye Color: Black\nFather\u2019s Name: Ibrahim Mohamed El Hamaki\nGraduated From: Cairo Academy Of Arts and Music\nFavorite Movie: Troy\nFavorite Music: Pop and RnB\nFavorite Food: Mahshy Wara\u2019 Enab\nFavorite Book: In Search of Identity, by Mohamed Anwar Al-Sadat\nFavorite Video Game: Winning Eleven\nFavorite Clothing: D&G, Cavalli\nFavorite Jeans: Diesel\nFavorite Sports Brand: Adidas\nFavorite Perfume: Ultraviolet\nFavorite Chocolate: Snickers\nFavorite Ice Cream Flavor: Chocolate\nInstruments: Guitar and Percussion\nFavorite Male Singer: Craig David & Mohamed Mounir\nFavorite Female Singer: Christina Aguilera\nFavorite Song: Men Awel Lamsa\nFavorite Personal Song: Madarch Ansaak - We Eftakart\nFavorite Actor: Ahmed Zaki - Ahmad El Sakka - Ahmad Helmy\nFavorite Actress: Soaad Hosny - Mona Zaki - Ghada Adel\nFavorite Sport: Football, Swimming\nFavorite Soccer Team: Al-Ahly - Barcelona FC\nFavorite Soccer Player: Maradona - Messy - Taher Abo Zaid\nFavorite Color: Blue\nFavorite Quote: \"Always look on the bright side of life\"","general_manager":"Mr.Yasser Khalil (Hamaki's Business Manager)","genre":"Pop Music","hometown":"Cairo, Egypt","is_published":true,"press_contact":"http:\/\/www.hamaki.me\/mh\/contact","record_label":"Nogoum Records","talking_about_count":90564,"username":"hamaki","website":"http:\/\/www.hamaki.me\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"132811284383","name":"Mohamed Hamaki","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/hamaki","likes":4890375,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152030407824384","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/1393678_10152030407824384_678255834_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Visit www.OutKast.com for the Official OutKast Music Store!","band_members":"Andr\u00e9 \"Andr\u00e9 3000\" Benjamin & Antwan \"Big Boi\" Patton","bio":"Genius: somebody with exceptional ability, especially somebody whose intellectual or creative achievements gain worldwide recognition.\n\n\nThere's an old proverb about genius that says \u201ctalent does what it can, genius does what it must.\u201d  In the world of the corporate-controlled, media-driven, trend-following music industry \u2013 where record labels pump out cookie-cutter music by the baker's dozens \u2013 it is rare that you come across mainstream hip-hop artists who are willing to push the envelope by daring to go creatively where few artist are willing to go.  Most artists would rather stick to the carefully prepared scripts that brought them gold and platinum the first time.  Hence why so many of today's contemporary hip-hop records tend to sound alike.  \n\nFor the past nine years the Atlanta-based super duo, OutKast, has been consistently pushing hip-hop's envelope by expanding its musical boundaries with every album they release.  Their unique blend of jazz, blues, soul, rock and world music along with some good old-fashioned hip-hop laced with their Southern sensibilities has constantly set the world on its ear.  And none of their albums have ever sounded alike.  \n\nOutKast started their luminous career in 1994 when their classic hit, \"Player\u2019s Ball,\" became an unlikely single on LaFace Records\u2019 Christmas album, a label traditionally known for its suave R&B music.  The reaction to the record persuaded Antonio \u201cL.A.\u201d Reid (LaFace President, CEO and co-owner) to sign the young duo as the label's first hip-hop act.  Their spectacular debut LP Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, with its sparse samples and live instrumentation reminiscent of the golden era of 70s soul, sold one million copies and help to lay a solid foundation for the current explosion of Southern hip-hop.  \n\nWith their sophomore LP, ATLiens, Big Boi (n\u00e9e: Antwan Patton) and Dr\u00e9 (n\u00e9e: Andr\u00e9 Benjamin) showed the world that the South really did have something to say, and 1.5 million people were listening to \u2018Kast's trunk-rattling funk, gleaned from the spirit of Sly Stone, Mandrill, and George Clinton.  In addition to their incredible commercial success, critics were praising both Dr\u00e9 and Big Boi for their silky southern flows and clever lyrics celebrating everything from \u201cGrowing Old\u201d to the \u201cWheelz of Steel.\u201d  The record cemented the duo's position as one of the few groups on the cutting edge of hip-hop.  \n\nAfter the release of their third LP, Aquemini, the \u201ctwo dope boys in a Cadillac\u201d reached a major plateau in their career.  Declared a \u201chip-hop classic\u201d by several hip-hop publications including the Source and Rap Pages, Aquemini blended elements of 70s soul, funk, jazz and reggae with hip-hop to create a record that opened 3 million people up to new musical possibilities for the genre.  To this day Aquemini remains one of the quintessential records in hip-hop.  \n\nOn Stankonia, OutKast pushed the envelope even further by revisiting the spirit of George Clinton, Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Hazel, dipping millions of listeners into some good old-fashioned psychedelic hip-hop funk.  Once again, OutKast garnered rave reviews with their latest studio offering and, true to form, picked up a couple of million fans along the way.  The record sold a whopping five million units worldwide.  \n\nFor their fifth effort the two decided to take a break and release a greatest hits album, Big Boi and Dre Present\u2026OutKast, as a retrospective for the new fans who just got hip to OutKast.  The record contained three new songs, one of which, \"The Whole World,\" earned them a coveted Grammy Award for Best Rap Song by a duo or group.  Now with their sixth release, Speakerboxxx\/The Love Below, Andr\u00e9 3000 and Big Boi have taken a bold step forward by releasing an unprecedented dual CD containing their own individual musical statements, thus giving fans a glimpse into the creative minds of each member.  \n\nOn The Love Below, Andr\u00e9 3000 uses a musical canvas compiled of funk, rock, techno and straight-ahead jazz to explore the nexus between love and lust.  It is perhaps the most intensely personal statement he has ever made musical or otherwise.  \n\n\u201c[The Love Below] started as four or five songs that I was doing at home,\u201d says Andr\u00e9 3000.  \u201cI had these songs and I was starting to see a theme.  And maybe it was the way I was writing them or the mood I was in, but they were all revolving around relationships.  And so I said \u2018hey, maybe I should do this side project,\u2019 which will be all singing because I hadn't really wrote any rhymes for it yet.  So what I said was \u2018okay, I'll do this side project and put it out and this will be like a soundtrack to an independent film project that I'll do called \u2018She Lives in my Lap\u2019 but we decided that that title was too risqu\u00e9 for a movie.  So we changed it to The Love Below.\"\n\nWhile the independent film project never materialized, the movie did serve as a springboard for Dr\u00e9\u2019s continued exploration and experimentation with various forms of music.  In addition, the budding musician moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting and finish working on the album.  \n\nThe Love Below opens with Dr\u00e9 crooning in a sweet falsetto \u2013 much in the tradition of Phillip Bailey or Prince \u2013 on \"Love Hater,\" a swinging jazz track that would make jazz balladeers like Jimmy Scott and Joe Williams very proud.  For a taste of the funk, Dr\u00e9 drops intoxicating jams like \"Happy Valentine's Day,\" a hi-energy joint centered on a rhythmic guitar lick and a thunderous bass line that recalls the heyday of Parliament\/Funkadelic, and \"Behold a Lady,\" an up-tempo song that revolves around a space age techno-funk beat. \n\nThe single \"She Lives in My Lap,\" featuring actress Rosario Dawson, is a scintillating track celebrating the love that lives below the belt.  However, just when you think that you've got the hang of where Andr\u00e9 3000 is coming from musically, he takes you on yet another side street of his musical repertoire by giving you pleasantly surprising songs like \"Hey Ya,\" a funky jam that sounds like a cross between the Beatles and the classic Motown sound of the early 60s.  \"Roses,\" a song that chastises gold diggers and groupies, is another song that falls into this category.  Built around a slinky, funky groove and a classic rhythm with a near perfect backbeat, \"Roses\" also features Big Boi flowing milky smooth, combining complex lyrics with internal rhymes that will keep rap fans hitting rewind more than once.  Dr\u00e9 slows down the pace with romantic songs like \"Prototype,\" an ethereal funk ballad that celebrates 3000's perfect woman, and the smoldering ballad \"Pink and Blue,\" which celebrates the May\/December romance between a younger man and an older woman.  Each of the songs gives the listener a little vignette that actually helps frame the overall plot of the film script that will ultimately become the movie, The Love Below.  \n\n\"[The Love Below] is about this guy who doesn't believe in settling down.  He never felt like he's gonna get married,\" explains Andr\u00e9.  \"And one day Cupid shoots him in the club.  He falls in love with this girl who he has one nightstand with.  If you listen to the album, you can hear the story a little bit.  Like the song \u2018Roses\u2019 is about this girl name Caroline.  She's beautiful, but she has a stank attitude.  \u2018Pink & Blue\u2019 is about this lady named Ms.  Pinkerton.  She's an older lady that this character dealt with, so every song deals with a different character in the movie.\" \n\nIn addition to handling all of the production and vocal duties on The Love Below, Dr\u00e9 plays a great deal of the instruments on the record, including the keyboards and the majority of the drums programming (except for \"Roses,\" which was done by Dojo 5).  Dr\u00e9 can also be heard playing guitar on almost every song, with the exception of \"Love Hater.\"  The Love Below proves that Andr\u00e9 3000 is one of the most gifted musicians that his generation has produced.  \n\nWhile his \u201cpartner-in-rhyme\u201d shows off his musical diversity, Big Boi opts to showcase his lyrical prowess on his solo effort, Speakerboxx.  Big Boi does this by paying homage to the foundation of Southern hip-hop: the Roland 808 bass.  \n\n\"Basically, Speakerboxxx is my voice to the world,\" says Big Boi.  \"The name has two meanings; the first one comes from the larynx, the voice box.  The second was that I wanted to deal with a lot of Southern music on this one.  You know we like that bass, which resonates at the low end of the speaker.\" \n\nSpeakerboxxx opens up with a thunderous intro filled with rumbling 808 bass and segues into the rapid-fire ode to bass \u201cGhetto Musick.\u201d  \u201cGhetto Musick\u201d has a break-neck speed that would cripple the average MC's flow, but Big Boi floats on this complex rhythm like a butterfly soaring over a roaring river.  \"Tomb of Boom\" brings more of that trunk-rattling bass-laden funk that OutKast is known for.  \u201cWith that cut right there, I just wanted something that had the hardest, wickedest sounding bass with a real simple track, with some hard ass MCs on there.  I had to go get Concrete from right off the label because they was some of the hardest sounding MCs that I know.  Then I got Big Gipp because he is my brother in hardness.  And Ludacris is another cat outta the \u201cA\u201d who was hard because I really just wanted straight \u201cA-Town MCs\u201d on this one.  I'm really into MCing, and I'm just trying to come up with some shit that they ain't never heard before.\"  Anchored around a tight bass line, a hard 808 kick and a crashing hi-hat, \"Tomb of Boom\" induces a head-nodding trance that harks back to the golden age of hip-hop.

Blige and Musiq\u2019s \u201cIf U Leave,\u201d and co-writing on Usher\u2019s Raymond V Raymond album, Miguel says, \u201cFor me, writing is like making steak and potatoes into a Happy Meal\u2014how do I work in that substance but keep you coming back for more?\u201d\n\nWith the album tracks on his ByStorm\/Jive debut, All I Want Is You, Miguel certainly delivers.  Through his longtime partnership with LA-based underground stalwarts Fisticuffs, and his visits with veteran boardsmen such as Salaam Remi and Dre & Vidal, Miguel has cooked up a truly genre-bending m\u00e9lange of sounds.  On the same platter, you\u2019ll find traces of the Cali avant garde hip-hop he picked up from his high school homie Blu; the funk, electro and classic rock he borrowed from his crate-digging Mexican-American dad; and the big, rich harmonies of his African-American mom\u2019s traditional soul. \n\n\u201cOverall, I call my style \u2018eclectric,\u2019\u201d says the crooner who considers himself a mashup of Prince, Lenny Kravitz and Pharell Williams.  \u201cIt\u2019s edgy and it defies category, but it still reaches the people.\u201d\n\nProduced by Remi and featuring Roc Nation firestarter J. Cole, the album\u2019s title track and lead single represents this balance.  Since early summer, the hypnotic track has garnered widespread critical acclaim, constant radio play and a gang of online praise from everyday fans.  The underground hip-hop heads who know Miguel from his features on Blu\u2019s Below the Heavens; the hipsters who downloaded his adventurous, electro- 2008 EP Mischief the Mixtape and the young people of today\u2019s generation screaming for him on BET\u2019s 106 & Park, have embraced the hit single. \n\nWith more than 8 million plays on MySpace, his second single \u201cSure Thing\u201d has also captivated fans.  The slow-burn makeup song features a chopped-and-screwed hook with rock candy-sweet lyrics like, \u201cEven when the sky comes falling\/ Even when the sun don't shine\/I got faith in you and I\/ So put your pretty little hand in mine.\u201d  Like every track on All I Want Is You, the song is based on a true story.  \u201cI wrote \u2018Sure Thing\u2019 after I cheated on my girlfriend at the time,\u201d Miguel reveals.  \u201cInstantly, I knew I had made a mistake and I didn\u2019t want to do it again.  I started writing all these metaphors about how she and I belonged together like, \u2018If you be the cash, I'll be the rubber band\u2019 and \u2018You be the match, I\u2019m a be your fuse.\u2019  That song helped me sort out how I was feeling about her.\u201d  Not only did \u201cSure Thing\u201d help Miguel get his girl back, it compelled industry veteran Mark Pitts, JIVE Label Group\u2019s President of Urban Music and the CEO of ByStorm Entertainment, to sign the songwriter to an artist deal. \n\nMiguel\u2019s true love story continues with the mid-tempo bounce of \u201cGirls Like You,\u201d a track he penned after he and Miss \u201cSure Thing\u201d split for good.  \u201cI was enjoying being single, but every so often I\u2019d look at one of my homeboys who had a good girlfriend and it would remind me that I really wanted a connection.  It was like, \u2018I\u2019m out here doing all of this, but I\u2019m still lonely.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course Miguel isn\u2019t all Hallmark romance. On \u201cTeach Me,\u201d an electric-guitar-laced romp that recalls Prince, circa \u201cLittle Red Corvette,\u201d he chronicles his quest to satisfy a woman seven years his senior.  \u201cThat was a very\u2026interesting relationship,\u201d Miguel says with a sly smile.  \u201c\u2018Teach Me\u2019   is about how I learned what she needed and wanted physically, all the intricacies of what turned her on.\u201d \n\nAnd then there\u2019s \u201cQuickie,\u201d a roots-reggae influenced fantasy of a one-night stand Miguel wrote after watching a mystery woman wind at the club. \u201c\u2018Quickie\u2019\u201d is a really special record for me because marks my personal renaissance.  Up until then, I was known as the great guy, the little brother that girls would come to for advice,\u201d he explains.  \u201cBut there was something about that night\u2014maybe it was because I was underage at an over-21 venue doing adult things\u2014that opened me up.  I went home under the influence of alcohol and inspiration and I wrote.\u201d\n\nGiven his current candor and confidence, you might think Miguel Jontel Pimentel has always been so clear about his creative path.  But you\u2019d be dead wrong.  While he started singing and dancing at age 5, songwriting at 8, producing at 11, and signing a production deal at 13, he eventually hit a wall. \n\n\u201cWhen I was coming up in the industry, I had people telling me to dress and dance more \u2018urban.\u2019  A few even said I should stay behind the scenes and write because I was a \u2018hard sell\u2019 as a half-Mexican guy who sounds Black but looks Filipino,\u201d he recalls without a trace of resentment.  \u201cAt first I took the advice\u2014I wore the white tees, the fitted caps and the baggy jeans and focused on writing\u2014but that didn\u2019t work for me.  Only when I said, \u2018Forget what everyone else says, I should be,\u2019 did the doors start to open for me as an artist.\u201d\n\nAnd the doors are sure to stay that way for this artist\u2019s artist who cites James Brown, David Bowie, Queen, Kraftwerk and Jimi Hendrix as key influences.  After all the hard work, Miguel has been receiving positive reviews as the opening act for this fall\u2019s Mary J. Blige \u201cMusic Saved My Life Tour\u201d and recently confirmed as the opening act for Usher\u2019s \u201cOMG Tour\u201d in November.  Later this year, after 10 years underground and behind the scenes, he\u2019ll deliver All I Want Is You to an ever-growing audience that can recognize true talent when they see and hear it.\n\nGame-change starts.

This made the production companies compete to have Tamer in their team. \n\nBefore signing any label or joining any company Tamer started to release in 2006 his album \"Zekrayat\" that included all his previously issued solo songs together with other new songs. This album was so successful that the production companies competed more and more to obtain Tamer\u2019s signature. Finally Tamer joined Rotana Co, at the end of the year 2008. Rotana Co. launched Tamer\u2019s second album entitled \"Had Beyheb\" that obtained an unexpected success and it was the album the most sold and most downloaded on Internet at the time. Two of this album\u2019s songs, \"Had Beyheb\" and \"Tislam\", were video clipped by Tamer. \n\nAt the beginning of the year 2011 Tamer launched his second album with Rotana which is the third of his artistic career. This album \"Leya Nazra\" reached the summit of the cassette market sales and the highest Internet downloads as well highest listening percentage even though Tamer had not filmeed any song of this album.

{"about":"Get our new album BAD BLOOD now! http:\/\/www.ilovebotdf.com\nBe the first to see the Bad Blood doc and Damaged music video: http:\/\/bit.ly\/14exLjX","band_interests":"God sent us to piss the world off.","band_members":"Dahvie Vanity \nJayy Von Monroe ","bio":"Revolutions don't begin quietly. There's got to be a catalyst for change. There's usually a spark that ignites the flame. There's typically something that tips the scales. There's an unquestionable bang at the beginning. Without question, there's always a little Bad Blood.\n\nNow, there's no shortage of revolutionary implications inherent within Blood on the Dance Floor's sixth full-length album, Bad Blood\u2014available via the group's very own Dark Fan\u2020asy Records. The duo of Dahvie Vanity and Javy Von Monroe continues its original mission of musical empowerment and revelation with higher stakes than ever before. These boys stand ready for a new dawn. Are you?\n\n2012 proved to be a banner year for Blood on the Dance Floor. Their fifth offering, Evolution, debuted at #1 on the Billboard Top Electronic Albums Chart, #8 on the Top Independent Albums Chart, and #42 on the Top Albums Chart. It attracted high-profile guest appearances from the likes of Joel Madden [Good Charlotte] and Deuce. However, after sold out tour dates everywhere, Dahvie returned home at the end of the year feeling rather empty.\n\n\"I was worn out,\" he admits. \"We toured for almost nine months straight, and I came back broken, homesick, in pieces, and angry. I went through so many emotions. Once I started writing music, the record brought me peace. I finally got the chance to say everything that upset me. That's what this album is about. It captures our blood, sweat, and tears. It's anthem for the broken, poor, abused, and unspoken. I got the opportunity to reflect on where I was and where I'm going, and I emerged with this gift.\"\n\nAt the same time, it was a chance for him and his cohorts to embrace who they've always been. Enlisting a little help from longtime collaborators James Egbert and Rusty Lixx, they tapped into the purest exorcism of their style to date. Blending snaky and sexy synths, electronic dance music energy, anthemic singing, and even a little of the derelict rapping that earmarked their signature output, these thirteen tracks signify true cohesion and immense confidence.\n\n\"We had no limits on this record,\" affirms Dahvie. \"There were no constraints or limitations. We didn't hold anything back. We incorporated some of the old school elements like rapping, but we're more open than ever before. We're coming clean about a lot.\"\n\nThe first single \"Damaged\" remains a prime example of that confessional style. Ominous keys mount into a sputtering industrial stomp before slipping into an angelically haunting refrain. Dahvie reveals, \"It's an open confession. You realize you can't blame somebody else for your problems. You have to accept that you fucked up and you're damaged. Relationships fail because people don't realize what they're doing. You've got to admit you need help before you can move forward.\"\n\nElsewhere, \"Unchained\" channels raw fire, while the title track cycles from shimmering glitch sounds into a vitriolic declaration. He puts it best, \"My music and I are like a pair of scissors. We destroy what comes between us. That's what this entire album is about. This is for anybody having a bad day. Art is our avenger, and it can be yours. We're not backing down ever.\"\n\nEverything culminates on the thoughtful \"Morning Star\", a moving tribute to Dahvie's grandfather. \"He means so much to me, and he's passing away from Alzheimer's,\" he goes go. \"He always cared about me, and I'll never forget all of the time we spent together. I wanted to write a song that told him he'd always be my star and light and he'd never be forgotten.\"\n\nSince forming in 2007, Blood on the Dance Floor have grown into one of the most formidable independent acts in the music industry. Their previous five albums\u2014Let's Start a Riot [2008], It's Hard to be a Diamond in a Rhinestone World [2008], Epic  [2010], All the Rage [2011], and Evolution [2012]\u2014have led to the formation of a veritable cult fan follow. The band has appeared on Warped Tour and crisscrossed the States on numerous packed headline jaunts. However, Bad Blood signals the biggest chapter yet.\n\nUltimately, it all circles back to a positive message for Blood on the Dance Floor. \"Continue looking at the bright side,\" concludes Dahvie. \"Focus on your dreams. Have faith in what you believe in. I hope this gives our fans strength and reminds them they can get through anything. Most importantly, stay true to who you are.\" \u2014 Rick Florino, July 2013","booking_agent":" ---- Steve Gordon, steve\u0040circletalentagency.com ---- ---- David Gordoni, david\u0040circletalentagency.com ---","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"San Diego","description":"Welcome To The Show.

The band\u2019s new five-song acoustic EP, If You Were a Movie, This Would Be Your Soundtrack, presents another crucial step on the band\u2019s ongoing journey toward\ntheir sonic destiny.\n\nFeaturing three new cuts as well as two previously recorded songs radically re-arranged for the acoustic setting, the EP showcases the group in a different venue than their usual, high-volume environment, while also giving new subtlety to the re-recorded tracks. Sleeping With Sirens are famous for their informal acoustic shows\u2014usually performed outside venues for fans after gigs\u2014and now that magic has been captured for listeners everywhere to enjoy.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to put out a record you can listen to while chilling at night and kind of winding down, or while doing your homework, or of you want to have some quality time with your girl or your guy. We wanted to give fans an album to listen to then, instead of just something that\u2019s always in your face and heavy,\u201d explains vocalist Kellin Quinn. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our band to be defined to a certain sound or theme; we want to be able to dabble in everything and accomplish different styles of music. This acoustic album was a way for us to grow up and show people that.\u201d\n\nSleeping With Sirens\u2014which also includes guitarists Jesse Lawson and Jack Fowler, bassist Justin Hills and drummer Gabe Barham\u2014was formed in 2009. The Grand Rapids, Mich.-based group\u2019s first album for Rise Records, With Ears To See And Eyes To Hear, debuted in March 2010 at #7 on Billboard's \u201cTop Heatseekers\u201d chart, and at #36 on \u201cTop Independent Albums.\u201d Guitarists Nick Trombino and Brandon McMaster departed after the album, and were later replaced by Lawson and Fowler, who first appeared on the retooled band\u2019s second album, Let's Cheers To This. Released in May 2011, the record peaked at #78 on Billboard\u2019s \u201cTop 200\u201d\nchart, as well as #13 on \u201cTop Independent Albums\u201d and #5 in \u201cHard Rock.\u201d The band has toured extensively, sharing stages with fellow scene stalwarts like We Came As Romans, Falling In Reverse, Alesana, A Skylit Drive, Blessthefall, Emmure, For All Those Sleeping and Motionless In White.\n\nTo record If You Were a Movie, the band traveled to Los Angeles for sessions with veteran producer Mark Trombino (Jimmy Eat World, Finch, Blink-182). The result was five rich, stripped-down cuts loosely presented in the structure of a film, with each song title starting with a scene number. Even the album cover illustration, which pictures a couple seated in a car overlooking a sweeping skyline, reinforces the EP\u2019s cinematic theme.\n\n\u201cWhen I started dating my fianc\u00e9e, we spent all our time watching movies at home, hanging out at the house. We\u2019re both fans of movies and the cinematic portion of life,\u201d remembers Quinn. \u201cI made her a mixed CD a long time ago called If You Were a Movie, This Would Be Your Soundtrack. I just thought it would be a cool name for an actual album. It\u2019s got a little history.\u201d\n\nQuinn utilizes the moody, dynamic textures of If You Were A Movie to reach new heights of lyrical depth and intimacy, tackling topics like love and relationships with a more nuanced approach than past recordings. The constant amorous tug-of-war that most couples inevitably face is given particular emphasis in the previously unreleased \u201cScene Four: Don\u2019t You Ever Forget About Me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thinking about a fight I was in and decided to write a song about it,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cI had the idea that \u2018no matter how hard we fight or how tough things get, just don\u2019t forget about me. Don\u2019t go to sleep without thinking about me,\u2019 just clinging onto that idea that anything can work as long as you put forth the effort.\u201d\n\nOn a different note, Quinn and company take a moment to acknowledge their good fortune as artists, and blast other bands who aren\u2019t as humble, in the new track \u201cScene Two: Roger Rabbit.\u201d \u201c\u2019Roger Rabbit\u2019 was written about just feeling really uninspired with everything that was going on with music. Everybody wants a hand-out; they want everything to come easily,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cI think that\u2019s the wrong vision and the wrong understanding of what it is to live. Sometimes things take time, they\u2019re not easy, and that\u2019s ok. That\u2019s part of the adventure of everything.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to use the time you have and take advantage of it, because you never know when it\u2019s all going to go away,\u201d continues Quinn. \u201cYou never know when you\u2019re going to take your last breath, and all your fame and everything you\u2019ve worked for will disappear. When you have the day, you should say all you have to say.\u201d\n\nFans will also be pleasantly surprised by the two stripped-down rearrangements of prior recordings that appear on If This Were A Movie. Both \u201cWith Ears To See And Eyes To Hear\u201d and \u201cJames Dean & Audrey Hepburn\u201d take on a new life on the EP, and in the process, convey entirely different emotions as acoustic recordings. Quinn says the new version of \u201cJames Dean,\u201d which was written in a moment of homesickness, is even more powerful than the original.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time I\u2019d been away from home for a while, the first experience of the band, I was just missing home, missing my fianc\u00e9e and our life together, because you have to sacrifice a lot of time apart to be in a band and be a musician and be on the road,\u201d Quinn reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s a sacrifice because you\u2019re doing good things for the people that want to come out and see you and love you, but you\u2019re sacrificing the person you want to be with all the time. It was cool to rewrite\nthat song acoustically, because I feel like it really shows the emotion that you can\u2019t really capture with screaming. The real passion and longing comes through in the acoustic track.\u201d\n\nThe remainder of 2012 and all of 2013 promise to hold even more exciting new developments for Sleeping With Sirens, starting with the band\u2019s first-ever run on the Vans Warped Tour this summer. After more touring in the fall, the group also plans to head into the studio in winter 2013 to begin work on their forthcoming third full-length. Until then, If You Were A Movie will serve as the latest reminder of the dazzling directions in which Sleeping With Sirens are headed.\n\n\u201cGet excited for 2013: There are a lot of big things coming, and this acoustic album\u2019s something to tide you over. Listen to it and enjoy,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cGet ready for the new [full-length] record, because it\u2019s going to be insane. It\u2019s going to be the best thing we\u2019ve ever done. We\u2019re going to go 100\u0025 into next year. We\u2019re excited for our band, and our fans, to be part of it. We\u2019re making music that is still going to be the Sleeping with Sirens that everyone loves, but we\u2019re definitely also growing and maturing. We\u2019re always moving toward bigger and better.\u201d","booking_agent":"US: Dave Shapiro - daveshapiro\u0040theagencygroup.com   UK\/Europe: Tom Taaff - tomtaaffe\u0040theagencygroup.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Everywhere, USA","general_manager":"Fly South Music Group - info\u0040flysouthmusic.com","genre":"Epic","influences":"America!","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Dayna Ghiraldi - dayna\u0040bigpicturemediaonline.com","record_label":"Rise Records","talking_about_count":62072,"username":"sleepingwithsirensband","website":"http:\/\/www.sleepingwithsirens.net","were_here_count":0,"id":"118479364878259","name":"Sleeping With Sirens","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sleepingwithsirensband","likes":1870895,"cover":{"cover_id":619065151486342,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1463750_619065151486342_1260017588_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Third album, The Awakening, out now! Get it from Amazon - http:\/\/bit.ly\/jmawakening and iTunes - http:\/\/bit.ly\/awkngitdlx. \n\nPatron of The Lewis Mighty Fund - http:\/\/www.lewismightyfund.org.uk\/","band_members":"James Morrison","bio":"As the title of James Morrison\u2019s third and by far best album suggests, The Awakening is the sound of an artist coming of age. In his personal life, Morrison has become a father, while losing his own father after the latter\u2019s long battle with alcoholism and depression. At the same time, Morrison, 26, has matured as a singer, songwriter and musician, enabling him to channel all of that emotion into his most accomplished collection of songs yet. \u201cMy first two albums felt like practice shots,\u201d he says, \u201cand now I\u2019ve graduated. In many ways this feels like my first proper album.\u201d\n\nPractice shots they may have been, but those first two albums \u2013 Undiscovered (2006) and Songs for You, Truths for Me (2008) \u2013 have sold a combined total of 4.5m copies and yielded an astonishing ten singles, including You Give Me Something, Wonderful World, The Pieces Don\u2019t Fit Anymore and the global smash Broken Strings, featuring Nelly Furtado. Those practice shots turned Morrison into an international star.\n\nHe has sold out arena tours, gigged coast-to-coast in America as well as in Australia, Japan and across Europe; he has performed on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s and Jay Leno\u2019s TV shows in the States; sung in front of tens of thousands at London\u2019s Hyde Park supporting both Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder; appeared on Herbie Hancock\u2019s Grammy-winning album The Imagination Project \u2013 singing a widely acclaimed cover of Sam Cooke\u2019s A Change Is Gonna Come; he has been voted Best Male at the 2007 Brit Awards; and \u2013 at just 21 \u2013 was the biggest-selling British male solo artist the year his debut album, Undiscovered, came out.\n\nEverything was new then \u2013 co-writing songs, recording professionally, adjusting to being in the public eye. \u201cIt was an amazing opportunity, obviously, but at the same time I found it hard living up to being the person that people thought I was. I kept getting: \u2018Ahh, James Morrison \u2013 he\u2019s so romantic.\u2019 And I didn\u2019t think I was that kind of guy. I wasn\u2019t trying to write songs to get the girls. That\u2019s not me at all! But I loved touring, playing live \u2013 that was the side that really made me believe in what I was doing.\u201d\n\nWhen the time came to record his second album, \u201cI was trying too hard to reconfirm why I was there and why people liked me. And that I could do it again\u201d. And he did do it again: the album\u2019s first single, Broken Strings, has been Morrison\u2019s biggest-selling to date to the tune of 1.5m copies \u2013 but he struggled to embrace the experience the way he had two years earlier. Looking back, he feels his second album was too pop, too \u201clukewarm\u201d, a step in the wrong direction. \u201cI thought, if I can\u2019t get it right next time, then I ain\u2019t doing this any more. I\u2019m losing myself, and I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nFortunately, The Awakening has turned out to be the album that James Morrison always had the potential to make \u2013 at last a worthy platform for his extraordinary singing voice. \u201cThis time I wasn\u2019t worrying about success at all, and that\u2019s why it was really enjoyable. I didn\u2019t feel I had to go for the big, loud notes all the time \u2013 I just sat back and sang how I felt and it all just came flooding out.\u201d\n\nThe Awakening is a warm, live-sounding collection of classic but contemporary folk-soul songs. There are musical similarities with Morrison\u2019s debut, but with added panache and self-belief. There are soaring strings, uplifting harmonies, soulful ballads and, in Slave to the Music, a hand-clapping dancefloor groover \u2013 a new string to his bow. There are nods to Motown, gospel, country and a hint of Latin. Technically, Morrison remains one of the finest white soul singers, equal parts Stevie Wonder and Paul Young. But he is more than just a Big Voice \u2013 he sings from the heart. \u201cTo me, pop music is just great music that lasts for years,\u201d he says. \u201cThough there is the other side of pop, which is where you have a hit, but then, after it comes out, it never gets heard again. I never wanted to make that sort of music.\u201d\n\nThree years in the making, the new album is Morrison\u2019s first for Island Records, after moving from Polydor. He has retained the services of regular co-writers including Steve Robson, the man behind Take That\u2019s Shine, Eg White (Duffy), Dan Wilson (Adele); as well as Toby Gad, best known for Beyonce\u2019s If I Were a Boy. Ten of the 12 songs are produced by Bernard Butler \u2013 the acclaimed former guitarist in Suede. Butler, who also played guitar on The Awakening and is hailed by Morrison as \u201cthe director of the album\u201d, has forged an impressive studio-based career, producing the likes of The Libertines, Tricky and Duffy .\n\n\u201cI was a bit nervous to meet him \u2013 his musical background is so different to mine,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cAnd that created a bit of tension in me to want to please him. So every time I sang I was really going for it, and he kept saying, \u2018Chill out \u2013 you\u2019re singing too much. Sing it softer.\u2019 But it clicked on the second day, and from then on I knew it was going to be epic ; I was so excited.\n\n\u201cBernard was really good at keeping the space in the songs and not letting them get too cluttered with production. You can hear everything clearly. Yet he made it sound like a proper record without it being too polished. It was exactly what it needed.\n\n\u201cIt was quite a full production, but at its core there were only four of us in the room \u2013 drums, bass, Bernard on guitar and me singing. We did seven or eight live takes of each song, picked the best and worked around that. We just made sure the vibe was good, and then whatever you put on top is going to sound great.\u201d\n\nThe song Up is another duet with \u201chit\u201d written all over it. It is one of two songs produced by Mark Taylor, who helmed Broken Strings. Morrison\u2019s vocal partner this time seems an incongruous choice \u2013 the potty-mouthed new queen of urban music, Jessie J. Jessie was suggested by his longstanding A&R, Colin Barlow. \u201cNot that I was doubting Jessie\u2019s ability in any way,\u201d Morrison says, \u201cBut I was worried whether she was the right character for the song. She got in the booth and did all this stuff that was amazing  \u2013 she is a ridiculously good singer, so in tune she\u2019s like Autotune . I wanted to tap into the side of her character that is just a normal girl. I was like, you\u2019re a Ferrari, Jessie, you\u2019re in fifth gear \u2013 take it down to third. In the end it worked amazingly: she sang the chorus the way I should\u2019ve sung it!\u201d\n\nJames\u2019s strained relationship with his father, who died last year from heart failure after a protracted and painful battle with alcoholism, inspired the lyrics for Up \u2013 and several other songs on The Awakening. \u201cIt\u2019s such a personal song: \u2018How can I find you when you\u2019re always hiding from yourself\/Playing hide and seek with me until it gets too dark inside your shell\/Why do I even try when you take yourself for granted \u2013 I should know better by now\/And when you call, I can already hear that crashing sound as it all falls down.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt was basically me saying to him: \u2018I\u2019m not going to put up with your shit, but I want you to know you have got the strength to turn it around for yourself.\u2019 I didn\u2019t explain any of that to Jessie, though \u2013 I\u2019d only just met her. We just focused on her delivering a shit-hot vocal.\u201d\n\nAnother song, The Person I Should Have Been, evolved out of a poem Morrison wrote after a conversation with his dying father. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t very well before he died, and we were talking about things he should have done, or things I should have done. It span me out, and I was like, I need to write about this because I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d\n\nMost raw of all is In My Dreams. \u201cI can hardly hear it because it affects me that much \u2013 I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to perform it. I was writing with Dan Wilson, and he asked me what I was feeling at the time. I told him that my dad had recently died and I was hoping he would come into my dreams, but he still hadn\u2019t.\u2019 And Dan said, \u2018I think you should tap into that,\u2019 and as soon as we had the title In My Dreams I just got a guitar and it all came out. Musically I wanted it to sound like \u201cup\u201d, like Curtis Mayfield or Stevie Wonder. I wanted it to feel like you\u2019re in a dream when you\u2019re hearing it.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, on the album\u2019s title track, Morrison drew on his own experience of fatherhood. His daughter, Elsie, is now three. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve just woken up to myself and to what I have to do. I used to say \u2018oh, I don\u2019t want kids\u2019 \u2013 and then when it happened it was the best thing ever. So I wanted to catch that\u201d. And on the stunning I Won\u2019t Let You Go, on which Morrison\u2019s voice really lets fly, his muse is his long-term girlfriend Gill \u2013 about whom he had previously penned songs such as You Give Me Something and, during a rocky patch, The Pieces Don\u2019t Fit Anymore.\n\nThe Awakening is full of raw emotion, but these are not \u201cdowner songs\u201d, says Morrison. \u201cYes, some of it\u2019s about dealing with shit \u2013 but it\u2019s also about looking at yourself and what you\u2019ve got around you, and weighing stuff up to keep yourself thinking positively. I think a lot of people will be able to relate to that, because that\u2019s what life\u2019s like, what relationships are like.\u201d\n\nThat is an outlook that Morrison did his best to adhere to during a childhood that was tougher than many. He was born in Rugby, the middle child of three. After his father left when the children were young, the family moved around the country, bedeviled by debts and the frequent threat of eviction, finally settling the Cornish beach town of Porth when Morrison was 15. He taught himself guitar and learnt to perform live by busking locally \u2013 although he failed music A-level at school. \u201cI could hear a note and play it on the piano and get it right every time \u2013 but I was crap at the technical side.\u201d\n\nA few years of dead-end jobs followed, reaching a nadir during a spell living in Derby when he was employed as a van washer (\u201cI was 19 and living the life of a 40-year-old.\u201d). But he kept his chin up, and it was while living there and performing at open-mic nights that he took the first steps towards landing the record deal with Polydor that turned his life around.\n\nThose formative years perhaps explain Morrison\u2019s unusual reaction to his own celebrity. \u201cI make a point of going to that extra level in my life to remind myself that I\u2019m normal. Like, I went camping to a Haven holiday park \u2013 and I didn\u2019t really want to go, but I thought that if I don\u2019t, it\u2019d be like I was saying I\u2019m too good for that. Like I don\u2019t go to Haven holiday parks, I only go to Hawaii or whatever.\u201d\n\nInevitably, he got mobbed \u2013 while eating sausage and mash with his daughter. \u201cI tried to explain that this was private, family time, but in the end I had to get escorted out by a mate. I ended up sitting on my own in the tent for hours, just so I could finish my dinner! I know I shouldn\u2019t do things like that because I\u2019ll get shit I don\u2019t want \u2013 but then if I don\u2019t do it I\u2019m creating a barrier, and I don\u2019t want that either. So I have to keep taking the opportunity to knock it down.\u201d\n\nThe bad news for James Morrison is that any future camping trips are likely to result in more undignified scrambles \u2013 The Awakening has the potential to send him supernova.\n\n\u201cYeah, it feels like it\u2019s exactly the right thing at the right time,\u201d he concedes. \u201cI\u2019ve only had a couple of moments like that in my life, but I\u2019ve learnt to recognise them when they come along. And it feels like that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now.\u201d","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Soul\/Rock\/Alternative","hometown":"United Kingdom","is_published":true,"record_label":"Island Records","talking_about_count":5701,"username":"jamesmorrison","website":"http:\/\/www.jamesmorrisonmusic.com\/http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/jamesmorrisonokhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/JamesMorrisonVEVO","were_here_count":0,"id":"6134209286","name":"James Morrison","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/jamesmorrison","likes":1297242,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150668409914287","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/s720x720\/426169_10150668409914287_996472848_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

And they're already legends, with a secure place in history and a plaque at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. But THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND is also a vital contemporary phenomenon, as much a part of the present and future of music as any band can be.\n\nIn early 2003, the group released the critically lauded Hittin' The Note, their first new studio project in nine years (and 24th overall). Released March 18, 2003 on their own Peach label (via a new deal with Sanctuary), these 11 tracks prove the band's ability to adapt its classic sound to the energy and aesthetics of modern rock. The ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND underlined the success of Hittin\u2019 The Note (including two Grammy nominations for the track \u201cInstrumental Illness\u201d) with a live DVD and CD recorded in New York during the group\u2019s annual marathon of shows at the Beacon Theatre (which they have packed over 140 times, including 14 sell-outs in 2006). The group also continues to release music from their personal archives, which they\u2019ve guarded closely over the years.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band at the Beacon Theatre\u2026just hearing the phrase conjures up images and sounds of well executed and passionately played live rock and roll. To capture the event for fans who might not necessarily have been lucky enough to get into the 2894-seat venue, the group recorded the shows, and released the Live At The2 Beacon Theatre DVD in late \u201903, and it was quickly certified gold. One Way Out, a live album from the same Beacon stand, came out in March 2004.\n\n2003 also brought further accolades for the ALLMANS. The band was recognized by Rolling Stone for featuring four of the top 100 guitarists of all time: the late Duane Allman was cited as #2, while current guitarists Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks came in at #23 and #81, respectively. Known as one of rock\u2019s best live acts, the ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND were one of only two artists whose live albums ranked in the top 50 of Rolling Stone\u2019s list of the \u201c500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\u201d The ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND was honored for At Fillmore East (while James Brown was saluted for Live At The Apollo). An expanded version of At Fillmore East and the previously unavailable Atlanta International Pop Festival (the July 1970 concert that they both opened and closed) were released to critical and fan acclaim. The group was selected as the first artist to introduce the \u201cInstant Live\u201d program, whereby fans were able to purchase CD copies of the ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND concert they just saw, immediately after the show.\n\nNot many groups have been around as long as The Allman Brothers Band. Of those that have, most have either lapsed into a nostalgia-act coma or withered on a weary vine. If you're talking about a band that has both legs and heart, whose experience feeds an intensity that's rare even among the greenest music newbies, that narrows the field pretty much down to these psychedelic sons of the South. But passion doesn't come easily, which helps explain why it's taken them so long to record once again. In April 1997, frustrated by tensions within the group that were threatening to slow its creative momentum, Warren Haynes and bassist Allen Woody left to pursue Gov\u2019t Mule (with whom he still tours and releases new music), and the focus of the group shifted exclusively to live performance. Though they still delivered killer shows, something was missing, and eventually it became clear that the only way to get it back was to make a change in the personnel.\n\nThe Brothers had been in this place before; most recently it had expanded its\nimprovisational range by bringing a fresh face, 21-year-old Derek Trucks, into the\nlineup, with a solo style that mingled elements of Southern rock, bluesy slide guitar, and free-form jazz. In September 2000, after the departure of longtime guitarist Dickey Betts, they reached this time into their past by inviting Haynes to come back. It was a poignant moment for all concerned, as Allen Woody's passing had suddenly put Gov\u2019t Mule on hold.\n\nSitting in with the Allman Brothers Band in 2001, during their annual concert series at New York's Beacon Theatre, Haynes slid easily into his old role, trading licks and\ncruising through the group's trademark twin-guitar passages, paired for the first time with Trucks. That's all it took to convince the band to start laying down tracks again. \"Everybody was itching to get back into the studio,\" Haynes says. \"We all wanted to break some new ground, and at the same time we wanted to maintain the Allman Brothers Band. Of course, that's not difficult with this band, but with all the new blood and excitement about making a new record, we found ourselves exploring a lot of new territory. The chemistry between me and Derek very quickly reached a telepathic level, and I think Gregg started singing better than he has since the '70s.\" More critically, a rush of new songs accelerated the band's momentum. \"Gregg and I started writing, and everything fell into place, even more so than in the past,\" Haynes says. \"The first song we wrote this time out was 'Desdemona,' and it was such a high water mark that we were like, 'Okay, now we've got to compete with that in every song we write.'\"\n\nThey kept to that standard on all the original titles recorded for Hittin' The Note. (The album also includes two covers, Freddy King's \"Woman Across the River\" and the Rolling Stones' \"Heart Of Stone,\" along with \"Rockin' Horse,\" which Allman, Haynes, Woody, and Jack Pearson co-wrote in 1994.) In settings that range from the intimate acoustic guitar duo \"Old Friends\" to the turbulent long-form (and Grammy-nominated) jam \"Instrumental Illness,\" Hittin' The Note proves that this band is bigger than any era through which it has passed, as strong as any of the many acts it has inspired, with a lot more history still to be made.\n\n\"Things have changed in a good way,\" Gregg Allman muses. \"They say everything\nhappens for the best, and you wonder why at the time, but then in the long run you see why. Someone will go, and that's a real drag, but then somebody else comes in who adds so much more than you even expected. With the people we've got now, as long as we just keep playing without any gimmicks or cutting any corners, I guess we'll be around for a long time more.\"\n\nThe Story So Far Allman knows better than most in this business how long a \"long time\" can be. In fact, his band, with its mix of down-home groove and instrumental virtuosity, blues-drenched soul and guitar-driven rock, and dedication to all-night jamming, laid the groundwork for what became known as the Southern Rock movement. You can date it from March 1969, when Florida-raised guitarist Duane Allman left Muscle Shoals, Alabama, where he'd established himself as an in-demand session player on recordings by Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, King Curtis and Boz Scaggs, among others. Seeking to form his own dream band, Allman recruited bassist Berry Oakley and guitarist Dickey Betts from a Jacksonville, Florida band called the Second Coming.\n\nHe also tapped not one but two drummers: the R&B veteran Jaimoe (then known as Jai Johanny Johanson), who had worked with Otis Redding, Joe Tex, and Percy Sledge, and Butch Trucks, late of a Jacksonville folk-rock group, the 31st Of February. Hammond B-3 organist and lead vocalist Gregg Allman had recorded two albums with brother Duane as part of the L.A.-based Hourglass, and was developing into one of the finest white blues singers of all time.\n\nThe Allman Brothers Band's sonic trademarks were all in place by the time their selftitled debut album was released in 1969 (see discography below). Driven by the relentless propulsion of Jaimoe and Butch, Gregg's bluesy keyboard comping, and Berry's deep, melodic bass lines, Duane Allman and Dickey Betts crafted a unique twin lead guitar approach that took its cues from jazz horn players (particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane) as well as the harmonized fiddle lines of Western swing and bluegrass. Together, they rewrote the rulebook on how rock guitarists could play together, and paved the way for every two- and even three-guitar band that would follow their path.\n\n\"Most fans had never heard anything quite like the mercurial solos and meticulous\ncounterpoint effortlessly unreeled by Duane Allman and Betts,\" wrote author Joe Nick Patoski in The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll (1992, Random House). \"In many respects, indeed, the Allman Brothers Band had become one of the most impressive bands in the country.\"\n\nOn their first four recordings -- The Allman Brothers Band, Idlewild South, At The\nFillmore East, and Eat A Peach -- the ABB perfected a sound that effortlessly combined rock, blues, country, and jazz on such unforgettable original tunes as \"Dreams,\" \"Revival,\" \"Midnight Rider,\" \"Melissa\" and \"In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed.\" By 1971, they were poised for superstardom. Even the tragic deaths of both Duane Allman (on October 29, 1971) and bassist Berry Oakley (on November 11, 1972) in eerily similar motorcycle accidents couldn't stop the band's upward trajectory.\n\nThe success of the No. 2 Pop single \"Ramblin' Man\" triggered a mid-Seventies run (with the four surviving original members joined by bassist Lamar Williams and keyboardist Chuck Leavell) that ended only when internal conflicts sundered the group in 1976. A third incarnation of the ABB was formed in 1978 for the album Enlightened Rogues, but after two further albums, the group disbanded once again. Yet the pull of their roots proved too strong for the Brothers to remain apart. In the summer of 1989, the Allman Brothers Band launched a 20th Anniversary Tour with Gregg Allman, Dickey Betts, Butch Trucks, and Jaimoe, complemented by slide guitarist Warren Haynes and bassist Allen Woody. (Percussionist Marc Qui\u00f1ones joined in 1991.) Signed to Epic Records, the new lineup returned to the recording studio with producer Tom Dowd for three studio albums and two live sets. (Dowd, a legendary producer and engineer, manned the controls for Idlewild South, At Fillmore East, Eat A Peach, and Enlightened Rogues.) Of the ABB's Epic label debut Seven Turns, The New Yorker wrote, \"The Brothers play with the energy of teenagers and the ornery wildness of veteran blues men.\"\n\nIn an increasingly predictable world of prefabricated pop, the ABB's peerless\nmusicianship and extravagant flights of improvisation earned the group a new audience- -one that transcended generational and regional boundaries. In October 1989, the Allman Brothers Band headlined the Beacon Theater in New York City for four nights, inaugurating a live performance tradition of multi-night stands that persists to the present. Their lengthy annual tours grew to include long stops in major cities, featuring ever-changing set lists: six shows at New York's Radio City Music Hall and five nights at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia, as well as multiple nights at the Wiltern in Los Angeles, the Warfield in San Francisco, Fillmore Auditorium in Denver, the Orpheum in Boston and the Fox Theater in Atlanta, among others. 1994 was a banner year, though not an untypical one, in the recent history of the Allman Brothers Band. The group made five live network television appearances; played 90 live dates, including the H.O.R.D.E tour, which they headlined; turned in one of the best, most exciting sets of Woodstock '94; and was voted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. \"In terms of sheer creativity, they're experiencing the\nstrongest second wind of any act,\" noted The New York Daily News. \"For sheer soloing ability, not only do the Allman Brothers run circles around anyone of the present generation, they outperform anyone of their own\u2026Their road deserves to go on forever.\"\n\nAt the 38th Annual Grammy Awards, held in February 1996, the Allman Brothers Band won the first Grammy in its 27-year history: Best Rock Instrumental Performance, for \"Jessica,\" a track from the acclaimed live album 2nd Set. This 16-minute improvisation may be the longest single non-classical performance ever to win a Grammy. (Another track from 2nd Set, \"In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed,\" was also nominated in the Pop Instrumental category.)\n\nIn the spring of 1997, when Haynes and Woody left to pursue Gov\u2019t Mule, they were replaced by Oteil Burbridge on bass and Jack Pearson on guitar. Acclaimed by critics and fans alike as the rising star of electric bass, Burbridge also performs with his own band, the Peacemakers (who released their second album Believer in 2005, and on occasional reunion shows by his former group, Aquarium Rescue Unit. (In September 2000, weeks after Woody's death at age 44, the Brothers organized and performed \"One For Woody,\" an all-star benefit concert at Roseland Ballroom in New York. The evening featured more than five hours of music by the Allman Brothers Band, Phil Lesh & Friends, the Black Crowes, Warren and Matt of Gov\u2019t Mule, and friends Little Milton, Leslie West, and Edwin McCain.) Tennessee\u2019s Jack Pearson continues to do session work in Nashville and performs live with his Jack Pearson Band. He is known to occasionally make guest appearances at the Brothers\u2019 concerts.\n\nIn June 1998, Epic Records released Mycology: An Anthology, featuring eight tracks culled from the Brothers' Epic catalog: \"Good Clean Fun\" and \"Seven Turns\" from Seven Turns; \"End Of the Line\" and \"Get On With Your Life\" from Shades Of Two Worlds (1991); \"Nobody Knows\" from An Evening With The Allman Brothers Band (1992); \"Sailin' Cross The Devil's Sea\" from 2nd Set (1995); and \"No One To Run With\" and \"Back Where It All Begins,\" from Where It All Begins (released 1994, certified gold in November 1997). In addition, Mycology includes two bonus tracks: a live acoustic version of \"Midnight Rider\" from the limited-edition benefit CD for the Rhett's Syndrome Foundation; and a previously unreleased version of \"Every Hungry Woman,\" recorded live at the 1970 Atlanta Pop Festival by the original lineup of the Allman Brothers Band.\n\nIn June of 1999 Derek Trucks made his debut on guitar, replacing Jack Pearson as colead and slide guitarist. Just 21 years old at the time, the gifted young player is the nephew of drummer and founding band member Butch Trucks. When not on the road with the ABB, he tours tirelessly with his own Derek Trucks Band, which has released albums (The Derek Trucks Band, Out Of The Madness, Joyful Noise; Soul Serenade; Live \u0040 the Georgia Theater, and Songlines). He has also toured as a member of Phil Lesh & Friends and recorded with Gregg Allman, Gatemouth Brown, Johnny Copeland, and Junior Wells. Onstage, he's sat in with Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy, and wife Susan Tedeschi, to name a few. Derek Trucks' epochal debut with the band was captured on Peakin' At The Beacon, a live set released by Epic in 2001. That same year, the Brothers announced that guitarist Dickey Betts would be replaced With Haynes' return to the group, the seed was planted for the band's triumphant return to the studio for the Hittin' The Note sessions.\n\nSince 1989 the Brothers have toured nationally every year, averaging more than 60 live shows per year. The tradition continues in 2006, with 14 nights of \"March Madness\" at New York City\u2019s Beacon Theatre from March 9 through 26. \u2026all of which leaves little unsaid about this incomparable band. Leave it to another\ntranscendent artist, Willie Nelson, to wrap up the essence of the Allman Brothers Band, as he did while presiding over their induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame: \"The Allman Brothers Band took what moved them and merged it into something unique that audiences love: a sound that redefined the direction of rock & roll, and opened the doors to a spirit of experimentation that continues in today's music. \"The Allman Brothers Band were and still are one of the most exciting live bands ever to hit the stage. They became road warriors with a vengeance and left devoted fans wherever they went\u2026[The ABB is] a band that reflects so many of my sentiments about music: originality, a determination not to be confined musically or stylistically, but instead to forge your own way and make music that moves you, a devotion to the road, and understanding that beyond pleasing yourself as an artist, the only other consideration should be the people, the fans who come to hear you. \"And so, with pleasure, I give you rock & roll's greatest jammin' blues band, the Allman\n\nBrothers Band!\"\nTHE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND\nA SELECTED ALBUM DISCOGRAPHY\nTitle Label Year\nThe Allman Brothers Band Mercury 1969\n7\nIdlewild South Mercury 1970\nAt Fillmore East Mercury (2-LP) 1971\nEat A Peach Mercury (2-LP) 1972\nBrothers & Sisters Mercury 1973\nWin, Lose, Or Draw Mercury 1975\nThe Road Goes On Forever (anthology) Mercury (2-LP) 1975\nWipe The Windows, Check The Oil, Dollar Gas Mercury (2-LP) 1976\nEnlightened Rogues Mercury 1979\nReach For The Sky Arista 1980\nBrothers Of The Road Arista 1981\nDreams (anthology) Mercury (4-CD box set) 1989\nLudlow Garage (live) Mercury (2-CD set) 1990\nSeven Turns Epic 1990\nA Decade Of Hits (anthology) Mercury 1991\nShades Of Two Worlds Epic 1991\nAn Evening With \u2026 (live) Epic 1992\nLive At Great Woods (home video) Epic 1993\nA Decade Of Hits Polydor 1994\nWhere It All Begins Epic 1994\nHell & High Water (best of Arista years) Arista 1994\n2nd Set (live) Epic 1995\nMycology: An Anthology Epic 1998\nPeakin' At The Beacon (live) Epic 2000\nAmerican University 12\/13\/70 (live) Allman Brothers Band 2002\nRecording Company\nHittin' The Note Peach Records\/Sanctuary 2003\nStonybrook 9\/19\/71 (live) ABBRC 2003\nLive At The Beacon Theatre (dvd) Peach\/Sanctuary 2003\nAtlanta International Pop Festival (live) Sony Legacy 2003\nOne Way Out (live) Peach\/Sanctuary 2004 (3\/23)\nMacon City Auditorium 2\/11\/72 (live) ABBRC 2004\nStand Back (compilation) UTV 2004\nNassau Coliseum 5\/1\/73 (live) ABBRC 2005\nwww.allmanbrothersband.com","booking_agent":"Podell Talent Agency http:\/\/www.podelltalent.com\/","category":"Musician\/band","description":"Welcome to the official Allman Brothers Band page on Facebook!","genre":"Rock, Blues, Jam Band","hometown":"Macon, Georgia","is_published":true,"record_label":"Peach and ABB Recording","talking_about_count":9720,"username":"allmanbrothersband","website":"http:\/\/www.allmanbrothersband.com http:\/\/www.ticketmaster.com\/Allman-Brothers-Band-tickets\/artist\/734412","were_here_count":0,"id":"56997158916","name":"Allman Brothers Band","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/allmanbrothersband","likes":838621,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151145901718917","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/539250_10151145901718917_2017253072_n.png","offset_y":104,"offset_x":0}}

We are talking about a classically-trained violinist, from Gilbert, Arizona, entering a futuristic world of big beats and animation \u2013 imagine Vanessa Mae leaping through the pages of a Manga comic with Skrillex in hot pursuit. Just months ago, Stirling was signed to Lady Gaga\u2019s management company Atom Factory. Her song \u2018Crystallize\u2019 was the eighth most-viewed video on Youtube last year, racking up an incredible 63 million views and over 2.5 million subscribers. With her first ticketed show just twelve months ago, she\u2019s now selling out dates across Europe, America, Russia and Asia. Her debut album has sold 150,000 copies in the US without the backing of a major label, and has gone Gold in Germany (over 100k sold) and Switzerland.\n\nIt is hard to believe that Piers Morgan told Lindsey Stirling the world had no place for a dancing dub-step violinist. But being voted off 2010\u2019s America\u2019s Got Talent, at the quarter-finals, turned out to be the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to her. Rejection simply strengthened Stirling\u2019s resolve to be herself. \u201cThe same reasons I was told I wouldn\u2019t succeed are the reasons people travel hundreds of miles to see me now,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBecause it\u2019s different. Because it\u2019s something you haven\u2019t seen before...\u201d \n\nStirling\u2019s debut album features twelve original tracks including viral smashes \u2018Crystallize\u2019, \u2018Shadows\u2019 and \u2018Electric Daisy Violin\u2019. She has created a new musical world where the romance of Celtic folk music and modern classical meet the infectious energy of dance and electronica. In \u2018Elements\u2019 you\u2019ll hear rhythm programming and \u201cwub-wub\u201d bass recalling dubstep giants Skream or Benga, while \u2018Zi-Zi\u2019s Journey\u2019 and \u2018Spontaneous Me\u2019 feature all the thrilling, arpeggio build-ups of trance. On stage, Stirling moves with the grace of a ballerina but works the crowd into a frenzy, \u201cdropping the beat\u201d like some strange, electro-pastoral rave fairy.\n\nLike Imogen Heap or Amanda Palmer, Stirling is the model of modern independent recording artist, with a formidable online presence and a powerful, symbiotic relationship with her fans. She is famed for taking \u201crequests\u201d and has recorded unique versions of the themes from Phantom Of The Opera and Game Of Thrones, the computer games Zelda, Pokemon and Skyrim, and songs by Michael Jackson and Rihanna \u2013 uploading them all to Lindseystomp, a YouTube channel packed with music videos and short comedy films, many featuring her alter-ego, a \u2018superfan\u2019 called Phelba. \n\nIt was no conventional childhood. Stirling was raised within a Mormon community in Arizona. As a teenager, the rigours of classical music training stifled her, and she nearly chose to pursue a career in therapy. But the violin would not let go, and it became a comfort throughout her struggle with an eating disorder in early adulthood.\n\nIt was her experience with America\u2019s Got Talent that inspired her to start composing. As a motivational speaker in her spare time, Stirling uses her own story to show teenagers that you\u2019ve got to have confidence in the very thing that makes you unique \u2013 then wait for the world to catch up. \u201cWe give more liberties to other people than we do to ourselves,\u201d she says. \u201c\u201cWe put labels on ourselves, but we love seeing people who just don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\n\n","booking_agent":"CBruck\u0040icmpartners.com","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Provo, Utah","description":"The violin can be whatever you want it to be\n\nMobile App http:\/\/mobileroadie.com\/apps\/lindseyapp\nMerchandise http:\/\/www.shopbenchmark.com\/lindseystirling\/\nSheet Music http:\/\/lindseystirling.mybigcommerce.com\/\nSubscribe www.youtube.com\/LindseyStomp\nTickets www.lindseystirling.com\/tour\nInstagram \u0040lindseystirling\nMobile App http:\/\/road.ie\/lindseyapp","general_manager":"Atom Factory http:\/\/www.atomfactory.com\/","genre":"Electronic","influences":"Bond, Vanessa Mae, David Garrett, and Barrage","is_published":true,"press_contact":"support\u0040lindseystirling.com","record_label":"Lindseystomp Music ","talking_about_count":102710,"username":"lindseystirlingmusic","website":"lindseystirling.com http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/lindseystomp http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/LindseyTime https:\/\/twitter.com\/lindseystirling instagram \u0040lindseystomp","were_here_count":0,"id":"132255980139931","name":"Lindsey Stirling","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/lindseystirlingmusic","likes":1840631,"cover":{"cover_id":661774377188086,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1453376_661774377188086_1435053311_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"The Next Day Extra - Order Now!\nThe Next Day Extra (digital) http:\/\/smarturl.it\/TNDE \nThe Next Day Extra (physical) http:\/\/smarturl.it\/TNDEamz","bio":"Where is David Bowie?\n\nIn the early morning hours of Tuesday the 8th January, Iso\/Columbia Records released a new single by David Bowie titled 'Where Are We Now?' exclusively launching in the iTunes Store in 119 countries. David Bowie's first new album in ten years and his 30th studio recording, THE NEXT DAY is also available as a pre-order on iTunes with a wide release scheduled for March. January the 8th is of course David Bowie's birthday, a timely moment for such a treasure to appear as if out of nowhere.\n\nThrowing shadows and avoiding the industry treadmill is very David Bowie despite his extraordinary track record that includes album sales in excess of 130 million not to mention his massive contributions in the area of art, fashion, style, sexual exploration and social commentary. It goes without saying that he has sold out stadiums and broken ticket records throughout the world during this most influential of careers.\n\nIn recent years radio silence has been broken only by endless speculation, rumor and wishful thinking ....a new record...who would have ever thought it, who'd have ever dreamed it! After all David is the kind of artist who writes and performs what he wants when he wants...when he has something to say as opposed to something to sell. Today he definitely has something to say.\n\nProduced by long term collaborator Tony Visconti,  'Where Are We Now?' was written by Bowie, and was recorded in New York. The single is accompanied by a haunting video directed by Tony Oursler which harks back to David's time in Berlin. He is seen looking in on footage of the auto repair shop beneath the apartment he lived in along with stark images of the city at the time and a lyric constantly raising the question Where Are We Now?\n\n\"The moment you know, you know you know\" resonates from the new single's lyric.

{"about":"unofficial tool fanpage ","band_members":"Danny Carey\nAdam Jones\nMaynard James Keenan\nJustin Chancellor","bio":"Adam Jones\n\nAdam's journey began in Libertyville, Illinois where, as a child, Adam began skipping Sunday school to read comics books at a nearby store. This rejection of the word of god in favor of the images of the comic microcosm carried over to school where Adam would draw pictures during teacher's lectures and think of music during math class. Adam studied violin as a child, but as Adam grew older he began to move away from the rigidity of a classical music and towards the sonic potentials of guitar playing. While most kids were involved in sports and homework Adam's musical talents and continued interest in comic books and sketching evolved into a desire for integrating and animating his ideas through the medium of film and the manipulation of three dimensional space through sculpture. Despite a film school scholarship offer Adam chose art school where he was able to hone his sculpting and sketching abilities. Still maintaining an interest in films Adam moved to LA and received training in make-up effects. He started a career working for Stan Winston's doing make-up effects and spent a few years working on movies. Maynard and Adam decided to start a band while keeping their day jobs...the rest is history. It has only been through the last nine years, however, that Adam has begun to explore the full potentials of projecting his thoughts and emotions through Tool's songs, videos, and album artwork. Sometimes in this environment, Adam is able to achieve a state of synesthesia where playing guitar invokes visions and images to appear before him and making videos, sketching, or sculpting creates auditory hallucinations of riffs and music. Currently Adam is sculpting a piece for the re-release of the Peach album Giving Birth to a Stone, writing music each day for the next Tool album with Danny and Justin, sketching the images he obtains in these practices, and dealing with the business side of the music industry. One way to perceive the experiences that have led to Adam's state in Tool is as the exploration of contrasting modalities of perception. As the hemispheres of the brain struggle for dominance there is a constant shifting of polarity between the right and left lobes that exists as music vs. number, image vs. word, being vs. doing, and holistic integration vs. linear abstraction. \n\nMaynard James Keenan\n\nOne reason Maynard was drawn to L.A. in the early 90's was to explore the possibilities of sacred temple architecture and regeneration. Thus it is perhaps easiest to sketch a brief history of Maynard through some of the elements within his living space. The floor has a formation that's round on both sides and hi in the middle that is best measured with the equation DV\/D = I (I being incidence); and a pack of gum, mo' happiness, and the apostle. Examining the wall introduces art pieces by Ramiro Rodriquez and themes best grasped through being Jung in Michigan. At the window frame a hairless cat stares intently outside at squawking irish parrots swaying drunkenly. Coast to coast some things never change. In another direction is a calendar of crossed out squares with A Perfect Circle scribed on May 23rd and \"NIN tour\" written under April 12th.\n\nJustin Chancellor\n\nJustin began his celebration of life in England where as a child you could often find him playing soccer with his siblings and friends. Sometimes Justin would catch himself mesmerized by the dancing and spinning of the ball sensing the possibilities of worlds within worlds. At the age of eight he began playing guitar and at fourteen started meeting and playing with the friends he would eventually form the band Peach with. Peach released the album\"Giving Birth to a Stone\" and later appeared as an opening band for Tool on several dates in England. Carrying with him a strange sense of alternate realities, Justin found himself able to access them through music and altered states of consciousness . When Tool needed a bass player in 1995 the journey to America seemed simple compared to the paths he had explored within his own mind. Currently Justin has been practicing entering hypnagogic states facilitated by sonic landscapes and a highly specialized form of tensor yoga. These function as the arc and threads that buoy and retrieve him from the watery matrices and emotional labyrinths he explores. He then utilizes these experiences as a reference point in his riffs and style to induce a holographic depth to Tool's music. Keep your eyes open for the scheduled re-release for Peach's \"Giving Birth to a Stone\" happening sometime soon. \n\nDanny Carey\n\nDanny grew up in Paola, KS. Relatively normal, an element of mystery was added to Danny's childhood when one day he spied his father with a large sword conducting a Masonic ritual. Danny would later notice himself performing similar movements when he began playing drums at the age of thirteen. As Danny progressed through high school and then college at the University of Missouri in Kansas City he began supplementing his studies in percussion with speculation into the principles of geometry, science, and metaphysics. A commitment to life as an artist brought Danny to LA where he was able to perform as a studio drummer with projects like Carole King and play around town with Pygmy Love Circus. He would later find an outlet for addressing a fuller scope of his potentials in Tool and another project operating under the title of Zaum. Despite not becoming a Mason or aligning himself with any other school of religion, Danny has maintained his heritages interest in occult studies. Endeavors into this realm have manifested periodically, such as the time he achieved insight into a hidden aspect of the unicursal hexagram utilizing an astral journey initiated through meditation and DMT. Danny then set up his drums into proportions utilizing the circle and square of the New Jerusalem and uttered a short prayer relating to the principles of the ace of swords from the book of Thoth. He then performed a ritual utilizing his new found knowledge of the unicursal hexagram to generate a pattern of movement in space relating to Fuller's vector equilibrium model. The resulting rhythm and gateway summoned a daemon he has contained within \"the Lodge\" that has been delivering short parables similar to passages within the Book of Lies. Danny recommends as a device of protection and containment a thorough study and utilization of the underlying geometry of the Temple of Solomon for anyone purchasing their next record. ","category":"Musician\/band","description":"Tool is an American Progressive Metal band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up has included drummer Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, and vocalist Maynard James Keenan. Since 1995, Justin Chancellor has been the band's bassist, replacing their original bassist Paul D'Amour. Tool has won three Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.\n\nTool emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album Undertow in 1993, and later became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their second effort, \u00c6nima, in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued with Lateralus (2001) and the most recent album 10,000 Days (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world.\n\nDue to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and relatively long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock and art rock. The relationship between the band and today's music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship and the band members' insistence on privacy.","genre":"Alternative metal, art rock, progressive metal, progressive rock, avant-garde","hometown":"Los Angeles, California","is_published":true,"record_label":"Tool Dissectional, Volcano, Zoo","release_date":"1990\u2013present","talking_about_count":804,"username":"unofficialtoolpage","website":"http:\/\/www.toolband.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"196301613716743","name":"Tool","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/unofficialtoolpage","likes":935688,"cover":{"cover_id":643449939001906,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn1\/s720x720\/936981_643449939001906_2089262897_n.jpg","offset_y":50,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"www.nicolescherzingermusic.com\nClick here to purchase my latest single Boomerang: https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/album\/boomerang-single\/id595676180","bio":"Her name is Nicole. You already know her as The Pussycat Dolls' lead singer, the one positioned way out front tempting listeners to loosen up her buttons. She was key to the group's success, selling upwards of seven million albums, touring the world, appearing as a guest vocalist on tracks by the likes of P. Diddy and Busta Rhymes, all accomplished in under three years and without missing a beat. Her name is Nicole Scherzinger. \n\nWhat you may not know is her story, which has its start in her birth state of Hawaii, a middle act in Kentucky, where she grew up, and the third (but far from last) chapter taking center stage as a true solo artist. Nicole's debut album may seem like an after-thought to the Dolls, but in fact, it's what she's been working towards all her life. Whether through her previous all-girl outfit, Eden\u2019s Crush, who were born out of the reality TV series \u201cPopstars,\u201d or as the background singer for multi-platinum late \u201990s rock group Days of the New, the part-Russian, part-Filipino, part-Hawaiian Nicole, whose nickname growing up was Hula, had her sights set on solo stardom for as long as she can remember. \"Some people's glasses can only be filled so high but I always knew there was never a limit to mine.  I always knew what I wanted,\" Nicole declares. \"People just see me as that girl from The Pussycat Dolls; I hear it all the time. They know 'Don't Cha,' which is amazing because it gets the attention and recognition, but as an artist, you need more to feed your soul, fill your glass. You need the music and that's what this album is all about\u2026 the music.\"  \n\nAll told, almost 100 songs were demoed or recorded for Her Name Is Nicole. \u201cI had to try everything to find the music that would introduce and reflect me as a solo artist.  Music I was passionate about that would show the many different sides to my personality.\"  For her first effort, Nicole enlisted the help of old friends (will.i.am, Polow Da Don, Sean Garrett, Kara Dioguardi and Timbaland) and some new ones (Akon, Ne-Yo, Pharrell Williams, Macy Gray and Sting). \u201cI love collaborating with a lot of different artists,\u201d she explains. \u201cI've been writing for the past 10 years but it's a different caliber when you've sold millions of albums and you're working with A-list writers and producers. I don't have the ego or confidence to be like, \u2018Yeah, I'm one of those.\u2019 And at the end of the day, I care most about the song. \u201d \n\n\"I recorded and wrote everywhere.  I was obsessed with my album.\"  The end result of her diligence, ambition and unbridled determination is the very definition of pop: music for the masses, but with a message and plenty of raw emotion. Take the deliciously addictive lead single, \"Baby Love,\" for example. \"The song wasn't about a beat, it's about real melodies that came from the heart,\" Nicole says of the track written with will.i.am and Kara Dioguardi. \"Kara and Will are geniuses and we wrote it in no more than 20 minutes.  \"I love the Hawaiian slack key, pedal steel in this song.  It's just another element that reflects my background.   I wanted to make sure I tried new things and sounds in the album that would separate it from other pop albums.  \n\n\"Supervillain,\" whose disco-inspired synth-heavy melody binds Nicole's five-octave range to another undeniable hook. \"It brought out the playful, fun, soulful side of me,\" she says. \"It felt like Motown!  I love Diana Ross, Roberta Flack and Dionne Warwick and when I first heard the song, which was produced by Madd Scientist, and written by Rock City, I thought, 'Man, this is like modern day Diana Ross!'\" \n\nTaking the drama up another notch is \"Physical.\" Produced by Timbaland, it brings out Nicole's rock roots, honed during her time on the road with Days of the New. \"I just had to have that song,\" she declares. \"The drums were so edgy and had so many unique sounds. I think it brings out another cool, wicked character that's in me. It's hot, a little theatrical with a rock-n-roll edge!\" \n\nOn the flip side is \"Just Say Yes,\" written by Gary Lightbody, lead singer of Snow Patrol. It is one of the five ballads on Her Name Is Nicole. The message of undying love resonated strongly with Nicole. \"Even though I didn\u2019t write the song, it felt like it came from me,\" she says. \"It did more than speak to me, it lives in me.  Anyone who's ever experienced love or a relationship understands things pulling in different directions, but this song is about succumbing, opening up and giving yourself over to love. It's such an honest moment and is one of the most vulnerable songs I sang but I did it not caring what anyone else would think.\" \n\nOn the same tip, \"Save Me From Myself,\" written by Ne-Yo, also hit close to home. \"When Ne-Yo brought it to me, he hadn't written the bridge yet,\" she remembers. \"And I felt the song so much \u2014 Tears don't stop the rain \/ Rain don't hide the tears \/ The tears I've cried \/ I've felt my share of pain, my share of fears \/ But through it all, I'm not afraid \u2014 Everybody can relate to that feeling of being in a dark hour, where they need a little help. I asked Ne-Yo if he'd allow me to finish the song as I heard it in my head. And he did.\" \n\nNe-Yo's second writing credit comes by way of the much buzzed about track \"Happily Never After,\" another emotional ballad that brought Nicole to tears. \"I had that same story in my life,\" she explains. \"I had been in a relationship where I didn't know my self-worth, my self-dignity, and I didn't know how to get out. Then when I left, I realized that I am better than this and that I have to love myself before I can love anybody else. As simple as that sounds, it's so true. So when I heard the song, I said I have to sing it. It's important for me to get this empowering message out there for all the young girls so they can say I deserve better, I'm not going to settle, not in this relationship or in my life. I think they need to hear that.\"  \n\nOther music luminaries lending their skills to Her Name Is Nicole include Akon, who co-wrote \"When You're Falling,\" T.I., who appears on the club hit \"Whatever U Like,\" and Sting, who took time out from The Police reunion tour to record \"Power's Out\" while on a stop in Boston. \"Sting's part of the Interscope family, but I couldn't believe it when I was in the same studio with him. I tried to play it off like, it's cool, but I was literally shaking,\" she confesses. \"We took a picture together, and I've taken a million pictures but standing there next to Sting, it's a little different. It's like you're taking a picture for the very first time.\"  \n\nAnother first for this already proven pop star: using the name of a Hawaiian flower, Puakenikeni (pronounced poo-wah-kin-ee-kin-ee), as both a catch phrase and a chorus. \"I'm proud of my background and heritage,\" she says. \"Puakenikeni is one of my favorite flowers because it has the sweetest, most fragrant smells, so Akon and I came up with this fun, kitschy line, 'Don't you wanna pick my puakenikeni?' It's my shout out to my family and the islands! \"Hey, I get 'um!\" \n\nIt was a long road to travel for Nicole, whose parents couldn't afford acting or vocal lessons for their daughter while she was in her teens. To get around it, she enrolled in a performing arts high school and then paid her own way through college where she majored in theatre and acting and studied dance extensively.  \"Singing,\" she adds, \"was innate from the start.  It was almost like my first means of communication.\" But where \u201cPopstars\u201d or Days of the New could easily have been her last shot, Nicole saw every audition and career move as a stepping-stone.  \"I remember the first time I was put up in a hotel on the Sunset Strip, jumping on the bed and thinking, 'I'm a huge star.' It was my first big break, going on tour with Days of the New, but I was always recording, working with friends who had studios and knowing that one day, I was going to make it on my own. I was always working towards this moment.\"  \n\nIn fact, when Nicole first tried out for The Pussycat Dolls, and was quickly cast based on her raw talent and experience, she negotiated a solo deal then and there. \"When they asked me to join the group I knew that was the window of opportunity I had been waiting for my entire life so I said 'You have to give me a solo contract as well.  I knew I would earn my stripes in time and, well, here I am talking about Her Name Is Nicole.\" \n\nIt's that tenacity which lies at the core of Nicole's entire being, and has been there ever since she was a child. \"When I think about it, I have a crazy story,\" she bemuses. \"Coming from little money and zero connections\u2026 I could have stopped with The Pussycat Dolls, selling seven million albums, but this is a mountain I have been determined to climb. The song 'March' that I wrote best explains it\u2026'If you can see it and believe it and put in the work, well then it's only just a matter of time!'\"\n\nSo what IS success to Nicole Scherzinger, the solo artist? \"People connecting to my music. If it reminds them of something, or if it makes them feel good, emotional, or if it just makes them want to dance or sing out, that's all I can ask for!  This music comes from my heart and when people hear it, they will get to know me.\"","category":"Musician\/band","hometown":"Santa Monica, CA","is_published":true,"record_label":"Interscope Records","talking_about_count":202990,"username":"nicolescherzinger","website":"http:\/\/www.nicolescherzingermusic.com","were_here_count":0,"id":"20226877432","name":"Nicole Scherzinger","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/nicolescherzinger","likes":6295823,"cover":{"cover_id":"10152069705597433","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/553916_10152069705597433_244173468_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Download Juicy J's \"Show Out\" now on iTunes: http:\/\/smarturl.it\/showout","bio":"They have a string of gold and platinum singles and albums.  They were the first rap group to win an Oscar and to perform at the prestigious Academy Awards ceremony.  They had their own hit MTV reality TV show.  But for Three 6 Mafia, it has always been about the music.\n\nSo it\u2019s fitting that the Memphis rap powerhouse\u2019s fifth major-label release, the astonishing The Last 2 Walk, extends its flawless track record and demonstrates that the group remains among rap\u2019s premier outfits.  Three 6 Mafia masterminds Juicy J and DJ Paul drench the high-octane collection with the type of bone-crushing lyricism and searing, addictive production that have become hallmarks of their material for the last decade-plus.\n\nAfter experiencing a number of line-up changes through the years, the group is finally pared down to only its essential members.  \u201cWe\u2019re the last two dudes to walk, DJ Paul and Juicy J,\u201d Juicy J explains, hence the album title.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been putting it down since day one.  In this business, you\u2019ve got to be focused and a lot of people aren\u2019t focused.  A lot of rappers come and go, because it isn\u2019t easy.  I understand what all artists go through, and that\u2019s the main thing that keeps us going -- the grind and staying focused.\u201d\n\nProduced primarily by Juicy J and DJ Paul, The Last 2 Walk contains the type of mesmerizing soundscapes that have made them in-demand producers for such platinum acts as Ludacris, Chingy and Young Buck, as well as their own artists Project Pat and Lil Wyte.\n\nLead single \u201cI\u2019d Rather\u201d kicks the campaign off with a sexually-charged vibe as Juicy J and DJ Paul flow over raucous drums and frantic keyboards about their sexual desires.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got spring break and summertime coming up,\u201d DJ Paul says.  \u201cSpring break is a highly sexual time of year.  It\u2019s a good song to be played at the spring break and into the summer because it\u2019s something everybody can relate to, except virgins -- and even then, they\u2019re curious.\u201d\n\nThree 6 Mafia keeps the focus on the ladies with a high-powered \u201cLolli Lolli (Pop That Body).\u201d  This fast-paced future club anthem features Project Pat and Hypnotize Minds\u2019 new artist Yung D.  The song\u2019s aim:  to get women dancing.  \u201cOn Three 6 Mafia albums, we always try to put at least one song on there for the girls,\u201d DJ Paul says.  \u201cIt\u2019s something they can dance to and shake their booties to.  You want the girls to be happy.\u201d\n\nThat is certainly true, but Three 6 Mafia\u2019s earned their stripes and hood status in large part to the \u201cget buck\u201d style of rap that they helped popularize.  It\u2019s a crunk-like style of music that hits hard in the clubs and features rowdy chants and frenetic beats that is on full display with The Last 2 Walk songs \u201cWeed Blow Pills,\u201d \u201cTrap Boom\u201d and \u201cGet Ya Robbed.\u201d \n\nThe group then gets smooth on \u201cThat\u2019s Right,\u201d which features Akon, and \u201cHood Star,\u201d with Lyfe Jennings.  Three 6 Mafia adds a new wrinkle to its music with \u201cMy Own Way,\u201d which features rock group Good Charlotte and is dedicated to living life by your own rules.\n\nBut some rules come back to haunt you when broken.  Knowing this, Three 6 Mafia takes an introspective look at the damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t life of a small-time criminal on \u201cCorner Man.\u201d  \u201cI was talking about how you might be young and you might get yourself into a situation where you stole a car or selling some rocks,\u201d DJ Paul says.  \u201cIt could follow you for the rest of your life, but if you clean up, it\u2019s still hard to get jobs.  It\u2019s hard for people to trust someone when they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, you went to jail for stealing, but you want to work at my grocery store?\u2019\u201d\n\nRegardless of a song\u2019s mood or lyrical direction, Juicy J and DJ Paul know that they\u2019re in each other\u2019s corner.  \u201cIt\u2019s about teamwork,\u201d Juicy J reveals.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to work together.  We don\u2019t let egos get involved.  We\u2019re both on the same page.  We have the same goals, as far as grinding and trying to make good music.\u201d\n \nTruth be told, Three 6 Mafia has been making good music since the mid 1990s.  The group\u2019s early underground albums -- 1995\u2019s Mystic Stylez, 1996\u2019s The End -- spawned such Southern hits as \u201cBreak Da Law\u201d and \u201cTear Da Club Up.\u201d  Since then, their four major label albums (1997\u2019s Chapter 2: World Domination, 2000\u2019s When The Smoke Clears - Sixty 6, Sixty 1, 2003\u2019s Da Unbreakables, 2005\u2019s Most Known Unknown) have all gone gold or platinum and have included such smash hits as \u201cSippin\u2019 On Syrup,\u201d \u201cRidin Spinners,\u201d \u201cStay Fly\u201d and \u201cPoppin\u2019 My Collar.\u201d\n \nConsistency allows Three 6 Mafia to remain potent.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep your ear to the streets and you\u2019ve got to be on top of your game,\u201d Juicy J reveals.  \u201cMusic changes, man.  Three 6 Mafia\u2019s been out for over 10 years.  Different musicians do different things to get their motivation.  We get our inspiration from our hometown, Memphis, the home of blues and rock and roll.  It\u2019s a musical city, so we get our ideas from our culture.\u201d\n\nBeyond their own albums, those ideas included releasing the platinum direct-to-video movie Choices in 2001; releasing smash, independent albums from Hypnotize Minds artists Lil Wyte, Frayser Boy and Chrome; and composing their Oscar-winning song \u201cIt\u2019s Hard Out Here For A Pimp,\u201d from the acclaimed 2005 film Hustle & Flow.  \n\nAll of this success led to Adventures In Hollyhood, their Ashton Kutcher-produced reality show that debuted on MTV in 2007.  But don\u2019t think the mainstream exposure is going to change Three 6 Mafia\u2019s musical output.  They\u2019ve been in the game too long to lose focus on what made them successful.  \u201cThis is our eighteenth year making music and albums,\u201d DJ Paul says.  \u201cWe\u2019ve see it all and been through it all.  A lot of people can\u2019t say that they\u2019ve been around and are still being successful after 18 years.\u201d\n\nAnd The Last 2 Walk will only add to the streak.\n","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Hip Hop","hometown":"Memphis,Tennessee","is_published":true,"record_label":"Columbia","talking_about_count":1780,"username":"three6mafia","website":"http:\/\/www.three6-mafia.com\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"8186449367","name":"Three 6 Mafia","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/three6mafia","likes":856968,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150641836054368","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/404936_10150641836054368_1889510665_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"New album \"Back 2 Life\" available on iTunes Now! http:\/\/smarturl.it\/back2life ","band_members":"Sean Kingston","bio":"Dedicating nearly his entire life to music and achieving superstardom when he was just 17, Sean Kingston has amassed an untold amount of experience as a singer\/songwriter over the years. On his third-full length album Back 2 Life, the 23-year-old builds on that experience by greatly expanding his songwriting role, nixing the multi-producer approach of his last release, and pushing for a fresh new sound. Like his 2007 self-titled debut (featuring the double-platinum breakout hit \u201cBeautiful Girls\u201d) and sophomore album Tomorrow (featuring the smash singles \u201cFire Burning\u201d and \u201cFace Drop\u201d), Back 2 Life fuses reggae, hip-hop, R&B, and electro to create melody-soaked pop. But on Back 2 Life, the singer\/songwriter blends his newly strengthened vocals with fiercely inventive effects and hard-hitting live instrumentation\u2014a formula that\u2019s yielded his most passionately inspired work to date.\n \n\u201cThis album\u2019s a really honest reflection of where I\u2019m at in my life right now,\u201d says Kingston. \u201cI\u2019m proud that it shows everything, because it shows my growth too.\u201d Teaming up with Jonathan \u201cJ.R.\u201d Rotem, Red One (who produced \u201cFire Burning\u201d) and new producers Nic Nac, Kingston found himself tapping into his musical roots like never before on Back 2 Life. \u201cOn this album I felt the need to get back to my culture,\u201d says Kingston, who was born in Miami but moved to Jamaica when he was seven. \u201cIt\u2019s much more organic than anything I\u2019ve done before\u2014the music\u2019s real and it hits you on a gut level.\u201d\n \nIndeed, Back 2 Life emerges as Kingston\u2019s most richly eclectic and ambitious album so far. On the album\u2019s title track \u201cBack 2 Life (Live It Up),\u201d for instance, Kingston samples the vocals from the Soul II Soul classic of the same name and twists the lyrics into a triumphant call to action. Sweeping and celebratory, the song mixes pummeling beats with chilling synth effects and Kingston\u2019s fearless assertion that \u201cwhat won\u2019t kill me makes me stronger.\u201d After a masterful guest rap from T.I., \u201cBack 2 Life (Live It Up)\u201d dissolves into a stripped-down pairing of sampled vocals and delicate piano work that\u2019s both stark and stunning.\n \nAlthough Kingston keeps up that heady intensity throughout Back 2 Life, many of the tracks are built on party-ready hooks, such as his summer smash \u201cBeat It.\u201d The track featuring Kingston\u2019s crew Chris Brown and Wiz Khalifa, merges breezy melodies and bass-powered beats in a deadly catchy club jam that quickly landed the track on the Billboard Hot 100 chart upon its release this past spring. Bouncy and hip-swinging, \u201cBomba\u201d combines flamenco-flavored acoustic guitars, soaring vocals, and pounding live percussion in the sonic equivalent of some epic beach party. \u201cSeasonal Love\u201d supercharges old-school R&B with dreamy synth, sultry beats, and a fiery guest verse from Wale, while \u201cShotta Luv\u201d pairs ferocious guest-rapping from 2 Chainz with a velvety-smooth groove. And on the unstoppable post-breakup anthem \u201cSave One for Me,\u201d Kingston tells off the girl who broke his heart and then finds his own sweet revenge on the dancefloor.\n \nAll throughout Back 2 Life, Kingston boldly proves how far he\u2019s come since he first began recording songs on the tiny personal studio his mother bought him when he was 11-years-old. Back then, Kingston would whip up his own reggae-pop hybrids and perform them local block parties and talent shows in Miami (to which he returned after spending several years living with his family in Ocho Rios, Jamaica). But when his mother was convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud and sent to federal prison, the 15-year-old Kingston had to put his music dreams on temporary hold.\n \nAfter a brief period of homelessness, Kingston began bouncing around the homes of his friends and relatives and ultimately landed a lawn-mowing job to earn the money he needed to make a demo. Thanks largely to Kingston\u2019s dogged persistence in pursuing every hit-making producer he could find online, that demo ended up getting him signed to Rotem\u2019s then-newly-launched label Beluga Heights in 2006\u2014a deal quickly followed by a joint contract with Epic Records and the release of a debut album that went on to sell more than a million copies worldwide and spawn three back-to-back Top 10 singles.\n \nKingston released his follow-up album Tomorrow in 2009, then\u2014in May 2011\u2014suffered a devastating accident while jet skiing in Miami Beach. After spending nearly a month in the hospital and undergoing two emergency open-heart surgeries to repair a torn aorta, Kingston two months to heal\u2014and start plotting his return to the studio. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go anywhere while I was recovering, so I spent all my time writing songs and listening to beats,\u201d recalls Kingston. \u201cAll I wanted was to get back to doing music, which is what I\u2019ve been devoting my life to since I was eight-years-old.\u201d\n \nWith a voracious appetite for music including \u201ceverything from Taylor Swift to Ne-Yo to Musiq Soulchild to Paramore\u201d\u2014as well as a deep reverence for artists like Bob Marley, Outkast, and Lauryn Hill\u2014Kingston has recently broadened his musical role by serving as a songwriter for such performers as Jason Derulo (\u201cWhat Ya Say\u201d) and Iyaz (\u201cReplay\u201d) and discovering new musical talents (including Iyaz, whom Kingston found online and signed to his Time Is Money Entertainment label). Still, having sold more than 12.5 million tracks to date, Kingston\u2019s top priority is continually elevating his own music into new and unexpected territory. \u201cA lot\u2019s happened over the past few years\u2014I\u2019ve traveled the world and had relationships and dealt with breakups, so I\u2019m singing from the heart about things that I actually went through,\u201d says Kingston. In capturing those experiences on Back 2 Life, he adds, his main ambition was to keep positive. \u201cI knew I needed to address some difficult things on the album, but my goal was to do it in an upbeat sort of way,\u201d says Kingston. \u201cSo the songs on Back 2 Life are catchy and uptempo and everyone can have a great time to them\u2014but at the same there\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s all the way real.\u201d","category":"Musician\/band","description":"Request My Brand New Single \"Seasonal Love\" Feat Wale At Your Local City Radio Station!.","hometown":"Miami Florida -Kingston, Jamaica","is_published":true,"record_label":"Sony Epic Records","talking_about_count":20322,"username":"seankingston","website":"seankingston.com www.twitter.com\/seankingston www.instagram.com\/seankingston","were_here_count":0,"id":"5128508749","name":"Sean Kingston","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/seankingston","likes":8831580,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151826240228750","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash4\/s720x720\/1238808_10151826240228750_1339515205_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":50}}

{"about":"The Official Joy Division page on Facebook.","band_members":"Ian Curtis\nPeter Hook\nStephen Morris\nBernard Sumner","bio":"Joy Division were an English rock band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester. Originally named Warsaw, the band primarily consisted of Ian Curtis (vocals and occasional guitar), Bernard Sumner (guitar and keyboards),Peter Hook (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Stephen Morris (drums and percussion).\n\nJoy Division rapidly evolved from their initial punk rock influences, to develop a sound and style that pioneered the post-punk movement of the late 1970s. According to music critic Jon Savage, the band \"were not punk but were directly inspired by its energy\". Their self-released 1978 debut EP, An Ideal for Living, caught the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson. Joy Division's debut album, Unknown Pleasures, was released in 1979 on Wilson's independent record label Factory Records, and drew critical acclaim from the British press. Despite the band's growing success, vocalist Ian Curtis was beset with depression and personal difficulties, including a dissolving marriage and his diagnosis with epilepsy. Curtis found it increasingly difficult to perform at live concerts, and often had seizures during performances.\n\nOn the eve of the band's first American tour in May 1980, Curtis, overwhelmed with depression, committed suicide. Joy Division's posthumously released second album, Closer (1980), and the single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" became the band's highest charting releases. After the death of Curtis, the remaining members reformed as New Order, achieving critical and commercial success.\n\n\nFormation\nOn 20 July 1976, Sumner and Hook (who had been friends since the age of eleven) separately attended the second Sex Pistols show at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. The following day Hook borrowed \u00a335 from his mother to buy his first bass guitar. Sumner later said that he felt that the Pistols \"destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship\". Inspired by the performance, Sumner and Hook formed a band with their friend Terry Mason, who had also attended the show. Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. They invited schoolfriend Martin Gresty to join as vocalist, but he turned them down after getting a job at a local factory. An advertisement was placed in the Virgin Records store in Manchester for a vocalist. Ian Curtis, who knew the three from meeting at earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition. According to Sumner, \"I knew he was all right to get on with and that's what we based the whole group on. If we liked someone, they were in.\"\n\nBuzzcocks manager Richard Boon suggested the band call themselves the Stiff Kittens, and they were billed under this name for their first public performance, but the band instead chose the name Warsaw shortly before the gig, in reference to the song \"Warszawa\" by David Bowie. Warsaw played their first gig on 29 May 1977, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration, and John Cooper Clarke at the Electric Circus. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Mason was soon made the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. During his tenure with Warsaw, Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik and even got Curtis to audition for the band. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded a set of five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the demo sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they sped off.\n\nIn August 1977, the band placed an advertisement in a music shop window seeking a replacement drummer. Stephen Morris, who had attended the same school as Curtis, was the sole respondent. Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, stated that Morris \"fitted perfectly\" with the other men, and that with his addition Warsaw became a \"complete 'family'\". In order to avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, the band renamed themselves Joy Division in early 1978, borrowing their new name from the prostitution wing of a Nazi concentration camp mentioned in the 1955 novel The House of Dolls. The group recorded another demo at Pennine Studios in December, and played their first gig as Joy Division on 25 January 1978 at Pip's Disco in Manchester.\n\n\nEarly releases\nJoy Division were approached by RCA Records to record a cover of Nolan \"N.F.\" Porter's \"Keep On Keepin' On\" and was afforded recording time at a professional Manchester studio in return. Joy Division spent late March and April 1978 writing and rehearsing material. During the Stiff\/Chiswick Challenge concert at Manchester's Rafters Club on 14 April, the group caught the attention of Tony Wilson and Rob Gretton. Curtis berated Wilson for not putting the group on his defunct Granada Television show So It Goes; Wilson responded that Joy Division would be the next band he would showcase on TV. Gretton, the venue's resident DJ, was so impressed by the band's performance that he convinced them to take him on as their manager. Joy Division spent the first week of May 1978 recording at Manchester's Arrow Studios. The band were unhappy with the Grapevine Records head John Anderson's insistence on adding synthesizer into the mix to soften the sound, and asked to be dropped from the contract that they had recently signed with RCA.\n\nJoy Division made their recorded debut on 3 June 1978 when the band self-released their debut EP, An Ideal for Living, and two weeks later a track of theirs, \"At a Later Date\", was featured on the compilation album Short Circuit: Live at the Electric Circus (which had been recorded live on 2 October 1977). In the Melody Maker review of the EP, Chris Brazier said that it \"has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records but they're no mere drone-vendors\u2014there are a lot of good ideas here, and they could be a very interesting band by now, seven months on\". The packaging\u2014which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover\u2014coupled with the nature of the band's name, fueled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later admitted to being intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris insisted that the group's obsession with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band \"to keep on doing it, because that's the kind of people we are\".\n\nIn September 1978, Joy Division made their television performance debut on the local news show Granada Reports, hosted by Tony Wilson. Later in the month, Joy Division contributed two tracks recorded with producer Martin Hannett to the compilation double-7\" EP A Factory Sample, the first release by Tony Wilson's record label, Factory Records. Joy Division soon joined Factory's roster, after buying themselves out of the deal with RCA. Rob Gretton was made a partner in the label to represent the interests of the band. On 27 December, Ian Curtis suffered his first recognisable epileptic episode. During the ride home after a show at the Hope & Anchor in London, Curtis had a seizure and was taken to a hospital. In spite of his illness, Joy Division's career continued to progress. Curtis appeared on the front cover of the 13 January 1979 issue of the NME due to the persistence of music journalist Paul Morley; that same month the band recorded their first radio session for BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. According to Deborah Curtis, \"Sandwiched in between these two important landmarks was the realization that Ian's illness was something we would have to learn to accommodate.\"\n\n\nUnknown Pleasures\nIn April 1979, the band began recording their debut album, Unknown Pleasures, at Strawberry Studios in Stockport. Producer Martin Hannett contributed significantly to the final sound. The band initially disliked the \"spacious, atmospheric sound\" of the album, which did not reflect their more aggressive live sound. Hook said in 2006, \"It definitely didn't turn out sounding the way I wanted it.... But now I can see that Martin did a good job on it.... There's no two ways about it, Martin Hannett created the Joy Division sound.\" The album cover was designed by Peter Saville, who would go on to provide artwork for future Joy Division releases. Unknown Pleasures was released in June and sold through its initial pressing of 10,000 copies. Tony Wilson said that the relative success of the album turned the indie label into a true business and a \"revolutionary force\" that operated outside of the major record label system. Reviewing the album for Melody Maker, writer Jon Savage called Unknown Pleasures an \"opaque manifesto\" and declared \"[leaving] the twentieth century is difficult; most people prefer to go back and nostalgize, Oh boy. Joy Division at least set a course in the present with contrails for the future\u2014perhaps you can\u2019t ask for much more. Indeed, Unknown Pleasures may very well be one of the best, white, English, debut LPs of the year\".\n\nJoy Division performed on Granada TV again in July 1979, and made their only nationwide TV appearance in September on BBC2's Something Else. They supported the Buzzcocks in a 24-venue UK tour that began that October, which allowed the band to quit their regular jobs. The non-album single \"Transmission\" was released in November. Joy Division's burgeoning success drew a devoted following nicknamed the \"Cult With No Name\", who were stereotyped as \"intense young men dressed in gray overcoats\".\n\n\nCloser and Curtis's suicide\nIn January 1980, Joy Division set out on a European tour. While the tour was difficult, Curtis only experienced two grand mal seizures in the two months preceding the tour's final date. With Martin Hannett again producing, the band recorded their second album, Closer, in March at London's Britannia Row Studios. March also saw the release of the Licht und Blindheit single (featuring the songs \"Dead Souls\" and \"Atmosphere\") on the small French label Sordide Sentimental.\n\nLack of sleep and long hours destabilised Curtis's epilepsy and his seizures became almost uncontrollable. Curtis would often have seizures during shows, which left him feeling ashamed and depressed. While the band was concerned about their singer, audience members on occasion thought his behaviour was part of the show. On 7 April, Curtis attempted suicide by overdosing on phenobarbitone. The next evening, Joy Division was set to play a gig at the Derby Hall in Bury. With Curtis recovering, it was decided that the band would play a combined set with Alan Hempstall of Crispy Ambulance and Simon Topping of A Certain Ratio filling in on vocals for the first few songs. Curtis came onstage to perform for part of the set. When Topping came back out to finish the set for Curtis, some in the audience started throwing bottles at the stage. Gretton leapt into the crowd and a riot ensued. Several April gigs were cancelled due to the continuing ill health of Curtis, but the band filmed a promotional video for the forthcoming \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" single that month. The band played what would be their final show at the University of Birmingham's High Hall on 2 May.\n\nJoy Division were due to begin their first American tour in May 1980. While Curtis had expressed a desire to take time off to visit a few acquaintances, he feigned excitement about the tour around the band because he did not want to disappoint his band mates or Factory Records. At the time, Curtis's relationship with his wife, Deborah Curtis (the couple married in 1975 as teenagers), was collapsing. Contributing factors were his ill health, her being mostly excluded from his life with the band, and his relationship with a young Belgian woman named Annik Honor\u00e9 whom he had met on a European tour. The evening before Joy Division were to embark on the American tour, Curtis returned to his home in Macclesfield in order to talk to his estranged wife. He asked her to drop the divorce suit she had filed; later, he told her to leave him alone in the house until he caught his train to Manchester the next morning. Early on the morning of 18 May 1980, Curtis hanged himself in his kitchen; Deborah Curtis discovered his body when she returned around midday. Tony Wilson said in 2005, \"I think all of us made the mistake of not thinking his suicide was going to happen.... We all completely underestimated the danger. We didn't take it seriously. That's how stupid we were.\"\n\n\nAftermath\nCurtis's suicide \"made for instant myth\", in the words of music critic Simon Reynolds. Jon Savage wrote in his obituary for Curtis in Melody Maker, \"Now no one will remember what his work with Joy Division was like when he was alive; it will be perceived as tragic rather than courageous.\" In June 1980, the posthumous single \"Love Will Tear Us Apart\" was released, which hit number thirteen on the UK Singles Chart. In July 1980, Closer finally came out, peaking at number six on the UK Albums Chart.NME reviewer Charles Shaar Murray wrote, \"Closer is as magnificent a memorial (for 'Joy Division' as much as for Ian Curtis) as any post-Presley popular musician could have.\"\n\nThe members of Joy Division had made a pact long before Curtis's death that, should any member leave, the remaining members would change the name of the group. Eventually renaming themselves New Order, the band was reborn as a three-piece with Sumner assuming vocal duties; the group later recruited Morris's girlfriend Gillian Gilbert to round out the lineup as keyboardist and second guitarist. New Order's first single, the 1981 release \"Ceremony\", featured the last two songs written with Ian Curtis. While the group struggled in its early years to escape the shadow of Joy Division, New Order eventually went on to much greater commercial success than their predecessor band.\n\nFurther Joy Division material has been released since the band's demise. Still, a compilation of live tracks and rare recordings, was issued in 1981. Factory put out the Substance compilation in 1988, which included several out-of-print singles. Another compilation, Permanent, was released in 1995 by London Records, which had acquired the Joy Division catalogue after Factory Records went bankrupt in 1992. A comprehensive box set, Heart and Soul, came out in 1997. The compilation album The Best of Joy Division was released in 2008.\n\n\nMusical style\nJoy Division took time to develop their sound. As Warsaw, the band played \"fairly undistinguished punk-inflected hard-rock\". Critic Simon Reynolds asserted that \"Joy Division's originality really became apparent as the songs got slower.\" The group's music took on a \"sparse\" quality; in Reynolds's description, \"Peter Hook's bass carried the melody, Bernard Sumner's guitar left gaps rather than filling up the group's sound with dense riffage, and Steve Morris's drums seemed to circle the rim of a crater.\" Sumner described the band's characteristic sound in 1994: \"It came out naturally: I'm more rhythm and chords, and Hooky was melody. He used to play high lead bass because I liked my guitar to sound distorted, and the amplifier I had would only work when it was at full volume. When Hooky played low, he couldn't hear himself. Steve has his own style which is different to other drummers. To me, a drummer in the band is the clock, but Steve wouldn't be the clock, because he's passive: he would follow the rhythm of the band, which gave us our own edge.\" Over time, Ian Curtis began to sing in a low, baritone voice, which often drew comparisons to Jim Morrison of The Doors (one of Curtis's favourite bands).\n\nSumner acted as the unofficial musical director of the band, a role that he carried over into New Order. While Sumner was the group's primary guitarist, Curtis played the instrument on a few recorded songs and during a few shows. Curtis hated playing guitar, but the band insisted he do so. Sumner said, \"He played in quite a bizarre way and that to us was interesting, because no one else would play like Ian.\" During the recording sessions for Closer, Sumner began using self-built synthesizers and Hook used a six-string bass for more melody.\n\nProducer Martin Hannett \"dedicated himself to capturing and intensifying Joy Division's eerie spatiality\". Hannett believed punk rock was sonically conservative because of its refusal to utilise studio technology to create sonic space. The producer instead aimed to create a more expansive sound on the group's records. Hannett said, \"[Joy Division] were a gift to a producer, because they didn't have a clue. They didn't argue.\" Hannett demanded clean and clear \"sound separation\" not only for individual instruments, but even for individual pieces of Morris's drumkit. Morris recalled, \"Typically on tracks he considered to be potential singles, he'd get me to play each drum on its own to avoid any bleed-through of sound.\"\n\n\nLyrics\nIan Curtis was the group's sole lyricist. Curtis would write frantically when the mood took him; he would then listen to the band's music (which was often arranged by Sumner) and used the lyrics that were most appropriate. Words and images such as \"coldness, pressure, darkness, crisis, failure, collapse, loss of control\" recur in his songs. In 1979, NME journalist Paul Rambali wrote, \"The themes of Joy Division's music are sorrowful, painful, and sometimes deeply sad.\"\n\nThe band refused to explain their lyrics to the press or print the words on lyrics sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, \"We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like.\" The other band members later admitted they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise \"[h]is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics.\" The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. \"This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics,\" Morris said in 2007. \"You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one.' Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that.\"\n\n\nLive performances\nIn contrast to the sound of their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loud and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, \"the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars.\" In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, \"During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear more than two or three words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion.\" While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his \"'dead fly' dance\", where the singer's arms would \"start flying in a semicircular, hypnotic curve\". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, \"We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have a[n epileptic] fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him.\"\n\n\nLegacy\nDespite their short career and cult status, Joy Division have exerted a wide-reaching influence. John Bush of Allmusic argues that Joy Division \"became the first band in the post-punk movement by...emphasizing not anger and energy but mood and expression, pointing ahead to the rise of melancholy alternative music in the '80s.\"\n\nThe band's dark and gloomy sound, which Martin Hannett described in 1979 as \"dancing music with Gothic overtones\", presaged the gothic rock genre. While the term \"gothic\" originally described a \"doomy atmosphere\" in music of the late 1970s, the term was soon applied to specific bands like Bauhaus that followed in Joy Division's wake. Standard musical fixtures of early gothic rock bands included \"high-pitched post-Joy Division basslines usurp[ing] the melodic role\" and \"vocals that were either near operatic and Teutonic or deep, droning alloys of Jim Morrison and Ian Curtis.\" Joy Division has influenced bands ranging from contemporaries U2 and The Cure to post-punk revival artists such as Interpol, Bloc Party and Editors. U2 frontman Bono stated that his group \"loved\" Joy Division. The singer said in the band's 2006 autobiography U2 by U2, \"It would be harder to find a darker place in music than Joy Division. Their name, their lyrics and their singer were as big a black cloud as you could find in the sky. And yet I sensed the pursuit of God, or light, or reason...a reason to be. With Joy Division, you felt from this singer, beauty was truth and truth was beauty, and theirs was a search for both.\" Artists including electronica performer Moby and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante have described their appreciation for Joy Division's music and the influence it has had on their own material. In 2005, Joy Division were inducted along with New Order into the UK Music Hall of Fame.\n\nTwo biopics have been released that dramatise Joy Division on film. 24 Hour Party People (2002) presented a somewhat fictionalised account of the rise and fall of Factory Records, in which the members of Joy Division served as supporting characters. Tony Wilson said of the film, \"It's all true, it's all not true. It's not a fucking documentary\", insisting that whenever possible during the production of the film, he favoured the \"myth\" over the truth. The 2007 film Control, directed by Anton Corbijn, is a biography of Ian Curtis (portrayed by Sam Riley) that uses Deborah Curtis's biography of her late husband, Touching from a Distance (1995), as its basis.Control had its international premiere on the opening night of Director's Fortnight at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, where it was critically well-received. That year Grant Gee directed a documentary about the band, simply entitled Joy Division.\n","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Post-punk","hometown":"Salford, Manchester","is_published":true,"record_label":"Factory Records\/Warner Music","talking_about_count":6630,"username":"JoyDivisionOfficial","were_here_count":0,"id":"122660121101711","name":"Joy Division","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JoyDivisionOfficial","likes":1854635,"cover":{"cover_id":377848742249513,"source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/s720x720\/389349_377848742249513_2114033653_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"We're The Band Perry and we play Country music. Follow us on Twitter \u0040TheBandPerry & http:\/\/instagram.com\/thebandperry!","band_members":"Kimberly Perry\nReid Perry\nNeil Perry","bio":"Kimberly Perry \u2014 lead vocals, guitar, piano \/ Reid Perry \u2014 bass, vocals \/ Neil Perry \u2014 mandolin, drums, accordion, vocals\n\nPioneer\n\nSince releasing their self-titled debut album in 2010, The Band Perry have ascended to dizzying heights. Fronted by Kimberly Perry and rounded out by her younger brothers Neil and Reid, the band has notched a string of hit singles, including the quadruple-platinum \u201cIf I Die Young\u201d (which climbed to No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Country and AC charts), the platinum \u201cYou Lie,\u201d and the Country No. 1 \u201cAll Your Life.\u201d They\u2019ve also enjoyed sold-out tours and a showering of honors, including multiple ACM, CMA, and CMT Music awards, as well as Grammy, Teen Choice, AMA, ACA, and Billboard Music award nominations \u2014 all of which has cemented the sibling trio as one of the hottest acts in recent history.   \n\nBut despite the validation that comes with such success, Kimberly, Reid, and Neil felt as if they were walking into the unknown when it came time to write and record their second album, which they\u2019ve called Pioneer. \u201cPeople hear the word \u2018pioneer\u2019 and they think of covered wagons or astronauts on the moon, but to us the idea of a pioneer is very modern,\u201d Reid says. \u201cIt reflects the idea of putting one foot in front of the other when you\u2019re unsure how to get where you\u2019re going. It\u2019s about marching forward and making noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had so many questions about our future, both personally and professionally,\u201d Kimberly explains. \u201cYou can hear it in the lyrics to the song \u2018Pioneer,\u2019 which asks, \u2018Where are we going?\u2019 \u2018What will become of us?\u2019 After writing those lines, the song became our guiding light throughout the process of recording the album, which is why we chose it as the title track. It\u2019s truly about the last three years of our lives and trusting that the songs we wrote would lead us where we were supposed to go. We also had to let go of fear and trust the boldness that has always informed our creative decisions.\u201d\n\nThe boldness is clearly evident in everything from Pioneer\u2019s album cover \u2014 with its bright red, grey, and black color scheme and the band\u2019s confident leaning-forward stance \u2014 to the album\u2019s fiery, rock and roll-influenced country sound. It\u2019s the first recording the trio feels truly captures the full-throttle intensity of The Band Perry\u2019s live show, which they attribute to the input of the album\u2019s producer Dann Huff. Huff, a Nashville veteran who was mentored by Mutt Lange and has worked with Faith Hill, Keith Urban, and Rascal Flatts, is the first producer who insisted on seeing them in the band in its live element. \n\n\u201cHe was flabbergasted,\u201d Kimberly recalls. \u201cHis mouth was hanging open. The first thing he said when we got off stage, was, \u2018Whoa, you guys have a rock and roll edge. This is what you do.\u2019 He had never heard it represented in our recorded music and he opened up our minds to that in the studio. That led us to add more electric guitars and background vocals, which created more daring musical moments. Dann threw out the rulebook and let us go anywhere we wanted.\u201d\n\nThe result is a collection of country-rock stompers like \u201cDONE.\u201d (an empowerment anthem \u201cabout how you feel when you\u2019ve given the best of yourself and it\u2019s still not good enough,\u201d Kimberly explains), the blistering \u201cNight Gone Wasted,\u201d and the Queen-influenced, punk-poppish \u201cForever Mine Nevermind.\u201d There are also vulnerable, thoughtful tunes like \u201cPioneer,\u201d \u201cMother Like Mine,\u201d (an emotional tribute to the siblings\u2019 parents, especially their mother), \u201cDon\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely,\u201d \u201cI Saw A Light,\u201d and \u201cEnd of Time,\u201d a ballad that recalls the band\u2019s Southern roots. \n\nThe trio\u2019s love for Southern Gothic culture, including such authors as Flannery O\u2019Connor and William Faulkner, is reflected on the platinum-selling first single \u201cBetter Dig Two\u201d \u2014 a foreboding tale of a woman who makes a lifelong, somewhat unhinged commitment, while still wearing her heart on her sleeve. \u201cThe song expresses what we love about the deep South,\u201d Kimberly says. \u201cWhen you listen to the lullabies and fairy tales told in that part of the country, they feel a lot like the lyrics in this song.\u201d (The platinum-selling \u201cBetter Dig Two,\u201d which spent two consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Country chart, is The Band Perry\u2019s fastest-rising single at radio ever, as well as their first No. 1 song in Canada.)  \n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m A Keeper,\u201d which Kimberly feels is very much her story. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m a free spirit first and foremost,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the woman in this song has big plans, with or without a man. Maybe she\u2019ll join the military, or maybe she\u2019ll buy a house out on the prairie. All she knows is she has a big life ahead of her.\u201d \n\nOne of the most meaningful songs to the band is \u201cBack To Me Without You,\u201d which was written in real time while Kimberly was dealing with the aftermath of a friendship that had imploded. \u201cIt was literally crashing and burning as we were writing the song,\u201d Reid says. \u201cShe was heartbroken and had to take breaks from writing it in the front of the bus to go to the back of the bus to cry. Neil and I kept telling her, \u2018Get back to what you know\u2019 and \u2018Get back to what you do,\u2019 which ended up being lyrics in the song.\u201d The track is just one example of how the band members raised the bar for themselves as songwriters on Pioneer. \u201cWe wrote every song on this album probably four times,\u201d Neil explains. \u201cEach time we\u2019d finish, we\u2019d ask ourselves, \u2018Is this song completely honest about where we are in life? Does it say everything we want it to say?\u2019\" \n\n\u201cOur first album was an honest representation of where we were at the time,\u201d Kimberly says. \u201cWhen we sat down to write songs, we had pictures in our head, and back then it was very romantic imagery, like Ferris wheels at the county fair. This time our inspirational images were of armies and marching bands moving forward. It was very militaristic, and I think you can hear that in the melodies and the lyrics.\u201d Adds Neil: \u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss the images we had in our heads with each other at first. It was just what we all felt and how we processed the meaning behind the music.\u201d \n\nTaken as a whole, Pioneer enables The Band Perry to accomplish one of its primary goals: to bring the romantic mystique of bands back to music \u2014 something they\u2019ve dreamed of doing ever since forming the group in Mobile, Alabama, where the Perry kids moved with their parents after a childhood spent in Jackson, Mississippi. Kimberly started her first band at age 15, with ten-year-old Reid and eight-year-old Neil observing every rehearsal from the sidelines. \u201cWhen the drummer and bassist would take a water break, they would jump on their instruments,\u201d Kimberly recalls with a laugh. \u201cThey caught the fever immediately.\u201d Reid and Neil started their own band, traveling with their family in a 36-foot motor home, playing modest shows in malls, campgrounds, and fairs. \n\n\u201cSometimes there\u2019d be more people onstage than there were in out in the crowd,\u201d Kimberly says. \u201cBut our parents, who had no legitimate experience in the music industry, said, \u2018We\u2019re not going to allow you to have a fallback plan. You were born to do music. We\u2019ll support you, we\u2019ll help you figure it out. This is what you need to do with your life.\u2019 That was really the moment the three of us joined forces as The Band Perry. All the friends I had been playing with become interested in other things. I needed a band and Reid and Neil needed a lead singer.\u201d Kimberly, Reid, and Neil spent the next ten years traveling, performing, and honing their skills before signing with Universal Republic in 2009 and being catapulted into the spotlight with \u201cIf I Die Young.\u201d To this day, they are most comfortable onstage. \u201cJust learning that craft made us feel comfortable when we started to book shows at the big arenas that we\u2019re now getting to play,\u201d Neil says.\n\nThe songs on Pioneer are tailor-made for arena shows. \u201cWe needed songs that could fill large spaces,\u201d Kimberly says. \u201cOur show is very aggressive; there are a lot of electric guitars and hard-hitting drums, and the music on Pioneer captures that.\u201d \u201cPlaying the new songs has given our live show a new burst of energy and the crowd feels it, too,\u201d Neil adds. \u201cThey\u2019re as excited to have new music as we are.\u201d \n","booking_agent":"For Booking information please contact: Rob Beckham at William Morris Endeavor Entertainment \u2013 615.963.3337 ","category":"Musician\/band","general_manager":"Bob Doyle & Associates","genre":"Country","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Erin D.

{"band_members":"Joey Ramone http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/joeyramone\nJohnny Ramone http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/JohnnyRamone\nDee Dee Ramone\nTommy Ramone\nMarky Ramone\nC.J. Ramone\nRichie Ramone\nElvis Ramone\n","bio":"The Ramones were loud and fast - Everyone knows that, even the poor, blind saps who never loved the band. But the Ramones were many things, and gloriously so, from the moment of their inception in Forest Hills, New York, in 1974, until their final concert, 2,263, in Los Angeles on August 6, 1996. \n\nThey were prolific - releasing 21 studio and live albums between 1976 and 1996 - and professional, typically cutting all of the basic tracks for one of those studio LPs in a matter of days. They were stubborn, a marvel of bulldog determination and cast-iron pride in a business greased by negotiation and compromise. And they were fun, rock n' roll's most reliable Great Night Out for nearly a quarter of a century. Which seems like a weird thing to say about about a bunch of guys for whom a show, in 1974 or '75, could be six songs in a quarter of an hour. \n\nThe Ramones were also first: the first band of the mid-'70's New York punk rock uprising to get a major-label contract and put an album out; the first to rock the nation on the road and teach the British how noise annoys; the first new American group of the decade to kick the smug, yellow-bellied shit out of a '60s superstar aristrocracy running on cocaine-and-caviar autopilot. \n\nAbove all, the Ramones were pop: stone believers in the Top 40 7-inch-vinyl songwriting aesthetic; a nonstop hit-singles machine with everything going for it - hammer-and-sizzle guitars and hallelujah choruses played at runaway-Beatles-velocity - except actual hits. According to an August 1975 article in England's Melody Maker about the crude, new music crashing through the doors of a former country-and-bluegrass bar in lower Manhattan named CBGB, the local press was already hailing the Ramones as - get this - \"potentially the greatest singles band since the Velvet Underground.\" A peculiar compliment since the Velvets' own few 45s were all crushing radio bombs. \n\nBut there was one thing you could never, ever say about the Ramones: that they were dumb. In their time, in their brilliantly specialized way, the Ramones - the founding four of Johnny (guitar), Joey (voice), Tommy (drums), and Dee Dee (bass); along with Marky, who spent 15 years and 11 albums behind the drums beginning with \"Road To Ruin\" and who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with the original four; - later followed by CJ, who stepped out of the Marine Corps and into Dee Dee's king-sized sneakers in 1989; and Richie, who kept the beat while Marky was on hiatus between '83 and '87 - were the sharpest band on the planet. Fully evolved as musicians and songwriters. Confident in their power and the importance of what they had. \n\nThe atomic-mono impact of Johnny's Mosrite guitar; Joey's commanding, sour-Queens vocal delivery; the unity of wardrobe and identity; right down to the original, collective songwriting credits and the mutually assumed surname - they were the result of a very simple philosophy. As Tommy puts it: \"Eliminate the unneccesary and focus on the substance.\" That is precicesly what the group did on every record it ever made, on every stage it ever played. \n\nThe Ramones' place in rock 'n' roll history was already assured by 1978 with their first three albums: Ramones, Leave Home, and Rocket To Russia, all made in the span of 18 months, between February 1976 and the fall of '77. When it was time to make records, Tommy says, \"our art was complete.\" The art was the combined product four strangely aligned personalities - all living within shouting distance of each other in the conservative, middleclass enclave of Forest Hills, where their mutual needs as fledgling musicians and bored delinquents far the mess of differences and civil wars that could never quite bust them apart. Once a Ramone, always a Ramone.","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"New York, NY","genre":"Punk","hometown":"New York, NY","is_published":true,"record_label":"Sire (US & UK, 1976\u20131992), Radioactive (US, 1992\u20131996), Chrysalis (UK, 1992\u20131996)","talking_about_count":11003,"username":"theramones","website":"http:\/\/www.ramones.com\n","were_here_count":0,"id":"12789020378","name":"The Ramones","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/theramones","likes":4998569,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151850298795379","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/1376490_10151850298795379_1714923717_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"about":"Don't miss out on an opportunity to see Carlos Live. Visit http:\/\/www.santana.com\/tour for the latest touring info.","bio":"When Carlos Santana was first approached by his friend Clive Davis to discuss the record executive\u2019s idea for a new concept album, the legendary guitarist and bandleader was reticent, as is his nature.  After all, these \u2018guitar classics\u2019, as the project came to be known, were \u201cthe Mona Lisas,\u201d in Carlos\u2019 words, \u201csongs done by the da Vincis of our time, legends of the guitar: Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, George Harrison.\u201d  How could Carlos put his unique stamp on them?\n\nQuite supremely, it turns out.  Once the organic song selection process got underway, the creation of GUITAR HEAVEN: THE GREATEST GUITAR CLASSICS OF ALL TIME, became a labor of love for everyone involved: Carlos, his seasoned working Santana band (recording their first full-length studio album together), the amazing cast of megastar lead vocalists, each hand-picked for their chosen tracks, hitmaking producers Howard Benson and Matt Serletic, and of course Clive.  His association with Santana has outlasted the 1960s, \u201970s, \u201980s. \u201990s, and \u201900s, and now kicks off another decade in the \u201910s with GUITAR HEAVEN\u2026\n\nThe turning point, reveals Clive, \u201cwas when he called me up and in the inimitable Santana way he said, \u2018You know, I\u2019ve really just trusted three people.  I\u2019ve trusted Bill Graham, I\u2019ve trusted Miles Davis musically, and I\u2019ve trusted you, and this is the time for a renewal of that trust and I will proceed\u2019.\u201d  Carlos underscores this point: \u201cTo create these songs,\u201d he affirms, \u201cit took an incredible amount of trust \u2013 from Howard Benson, and from Matt Serletic, and all these incredible singers, all these incredible musicians, they had to trust me, and I trusted Clive.  So it\u2019s a chain reaction of love, because that\u2019s the highest form of love that there is on this planet: Trust.\u201d\n\nThese synergies explode throughout GUITAR HEAVEN\u2026 from the opening sonic boom of Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cWhole Lotta Love\u201d featuring Chris Cornell, followed by the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cCan\u2019t You Hear Me Knockin\u2019\u201d with Scott Weiland, all the way to the voodoo-laced closing moments of Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s (via the Jeff Beck Group) \u201cI Ain\u2019t Superstitious\u201d featuring Jonny Lang.  \n\t\nClive\u2019s intention to keep Santana\u2019s music fresh for today\u2019s fans of Guitar Hero and Rock Band is achieved by guest appearances from Chris Cornell (on Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cWhole Lotta Love\u201d), Pat Monahan (on Van Halen\u2019s \u201cDance the Night Away\u201d), Chester Bennington and Ray Manzarek (on The Doors\u2019 \u201cRiders on the Storm\u201d), Rob Thomas (on Cream\u2019s \u201cSunshine Of Your Love), Scott Weiland (on the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cCan\u2019t You Hear Me Knockin\u2019\u201d), Chris Daughtry (on Def Leppard\u2019s \u201cPhotograph\u201d), Gavin Rossdale (on T. Rex\u2019s \u201cBang A Gong\u201d) to rapper Nas with newcomer Robyn Troup (on AC\/DC\u2019s \u201cBack In Black\u201d), veteran Joe Cocker (on Jimi Hendrix\u2019s \u201cLittle Wing\u201d), and more.  \n\nCarlos was barely out of his teens himself when he first ran into Joe Cocker & the Grease Band circa 1968, the year that Jimi Hendrix\u2019s Axis: Bold As Love catalyzed America.  To describe Joe Cocker, Carlos invokes \u201cpure, pristine, trueness\u2026 He does what a consummate artist should do, he makes time disappear, gravity disappear, problems disappear.  Bob Dylan calls it \u2018forever young,\u2019 I call it eternally relevant.\u201d  Cocker\u2019s delivery of \u201cLittle Wing\u201d (from Axis), one of many showstopping moments of GUITAR HEAVEN\u2026 \n\nAnother inspired pairing features singer India.Arie and master cellist Yo-Yo Ma on George Harrison\u2019s \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps,\u201d the first single pick from GUITAR HEAVEN\u2026   \u201cListening to the song,\u201d Olivia Harrison told Carlos, \u201cit made me jump for joy and cry at the same time\u2026 George understood your passion for compassion.\u201d  Carlos adds, \u201cSpirituality to me is Mother Theresa, the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu, Malcolm X, Marvin Gaye, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Wonder, Andre Agassi, Clive, all of us do what we do because there is no greater joy than to be of service to humanity.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the vocal roster, Carlos offers \u201csupreme validation and compliment\u201d to his full-time band for their work on GUITAR HEAVEN\u2026  Band members who join him on the album include Dennis Chambers (drums), Benny Rietveld (bass), Karl Perrazo (timbales), Tommy Anthony (rhythm guitar), Freddie Ravel (keyboards), Andy Vargas (background vocals), and Raul Rekow (Congas).  Bill Ortiz (trumpet) and Jeff Cressman (trombone) also appear on the record.\n\nThere are many reasons why the songs on GUITAR HEAVEN\u2026 are so close to the heart for Carlos Santana, but the deepest connection is that so much of the music resonates within his own life and times.  1972\u2019s \u201cBang A Gong,\u201d for example, takes him right back to his years living as a vegetarian at Sri Chinmoy\u2019s ashram in Jamaica, Queens, strolling down Parsons Boulevard while eating an eggplant hero, and hearing the T. Rex song blasting from a storefront.  \u201cRiders On the Storm\u201d evokes the memory of buying snakeskin boots at a store in London at the height of the Sex Pistols punk rock era.  \u201cBut this store still played the Doors, loud, and it sounded like Bitches Brew, it sounded like Miles.  Man, what is this?  I\u2019d heard the Doors before, but the way I heard it there\u2026 when I played the song, it took me right back to that place.\u201d\n\n\nGUITAR HEAVEN: THE GREATEST GUITAR CLASSICS OF ALL TIME is the fourth chapter in a new-old rock saga, whose roots stretch back to 1997, when Clive Davis attended his first Santana concert in some years, at New York\u2019s Radio City Music Hall.  (The year before, in 1996, Santana had received the prestigious Billboard Century Award.)  Clive originally signed Santana to Columbia Records in 1968, and oversaw the band\u2019s formative years on the path to international superstardom starting in 1969.  In the \u201970s, their paths diverged, but nearly three decades later, the chemistry between them was as strong as ever.  When Clive heard Carlos emotionally confess that his teenage children did not hear Santana on their favorite radio stations, Clive\u2019s mission on behalf of his old friend became clear.\n\nIt took two years to develop the album \u2013 in the interim, Santana was inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1998.  When Supernatural was released in 1999, it was the beginning of an industry phenom, 15-times RIAA platinum in the U.S. alone, nearly double that number of sales globally, the #6 best-selling album in SoundScan history.  Supernatural spent 102 weeks on the Billboard chart including 12 weeks at #1.  Its success was fueled by the #1 singles \u201cSmooth\u201d (12 weeks at #1, co-written by and feat\u00acur\u00acing Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty) and \u201cMaria Maria\u201d (10 weeks at #1, featur\u00acing Product G&B).  Indeed, the Santana kids were now hearing their dad on the radio, big time.\n\nSupernatural generated nine GRAMMY awards, an all-time record for a single album project, including Album Of the Year and Best Rock Album, as well as Record Of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Collaboration, all for \u201cSmooth\u201d; plus Best Pop Performance by a Duo\/Group for \u201cMaria Maria\u201d; Best Rock Performance by a Duo\/Group for \u201cPut Your Lights On\u201d (featuring Everlast); Best Rock Instrumental Performance for \u201cThe Calling\u201d (featuring Eric Clapton); and Best Pop Instrumental Performance (\u201cEl Farol\u201d)  There were also premiere Latin GRAMMY Award wins (the show\u2019s first year) for Record Of The Year and Best Rock Performance by a Duo\/Group for \u201cCorazon Espinado\u201d (featuring Man\u00e1).\n\nSupernatural was a hard act to follow \u2013 but 2002\u2019s Shaman gave Santana a second consecutive #1 multi-platinum album, propelled by the GRAMMY-winning Top 5 single \u201cThe Game of Love\u201d featuring Michelle Branch; and Top 10 \u201cWhy Don\u2019t You and I\u201d with Chad Kroeger of Nickelback.  The album also featured collaborations with Dido, Citizen Cope, Placido Domingo, Macy Gray, Alejandro Lerner, Musiq, Ozomatli, P.O.D., and Seal.  \n\nThird in this series of collaborative albums was 2005\u2019s All That I Am, which entered SoundScan at #2, led by the anthemic rocker \u201cJust Feel Better,\u201d featuring Steven Tyler of Aerosmith.  Other collaborators included Big Boi of OutKast and Mary J. Blige (on \u201cMy Man\u201d), will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas (on \u201cI Am Somebody\u201d), Joss Stone and Sean Paul (on \u201cCry Baby Cry\u201d), Michelle Branch, Raphael Saadiq of Tony! Toni! Tone! and the Wreckers (all on \u201cI\u2019m Feeling You\u201d), plus Anthony Hamilton, Kirk Hammett & Robert Randolph, Bo Bice, and Los Lonely Boys.\n\nThis quartet of albums \u2013 Supernatural, Shaman, All That I Am, and now GUITAR HEAVEN\u2026 \u2013 stands alone in the annals of rock history.  More than a decade after they renewed their association, the working partnership of Carlos Santana and Clive Davis continues to thrive and build upon its success.  To call their partnership unique in the music industry is an understatement.  \u201cCarlos has a very strong inner sense of what is right for him,\u201d observes Clive.  \u201cHe listens with an ear for the music but he also listens knowing, can this song be right for Santana?  Can he make it his own?  Does he feel that this came to him fresh?  I want Carlos to flower as he felt it and as he saw it.  That was very important to me, just let it flow.\u201d\n\nLong before \u201cworld music\u201d was a destination at search engines across the globe \u2013 or was even a genre, for that matter \u2013 Carlos Santana and the band that bears his name were laying down the tracks that would bring homegrown electric American music to the four corners of the earth.  In turn, the music ricocheted back to our shores, filtered through the musical waterfalls of Afro-pop and Afro-beat, Caribbean voodoo-rock, and a dozen geopolitical musical zones that now regard Santana as one of their own.\n\nCarlos Humberto Santana de Barragan came from the humblest of backgrounds.  He was born 1947, in Autlan de Navarro, Jalisco, Mexico (where a street and public square now bear his name).  His father, a virtuoso mariachi violinist, instilled a musical spirit in his son who also began playing violin at age five.  Later, when the family moved north to the bustling border town of Tijuana, Carlos took up the guitar and began to absorb his first influences.  Listening to the powerful American radio stations whose signals reached into Mexico, he fell under the spell of John Lee Hooker, T. Bone Walker, and B.B. King, a trinity of guitar heroes whose styles blurred the lines of blues and jazz.\n\nBy age 14, his family had moved to San Francisco, where Carlos graduated high school in 1965.  He soon began talking his way into shows promoted by Bill Graham and others at the Fillmore, Winterland, and Avalon ballrooms.  It was an eclectic crash course in Muddy Waters, Mongo Santamaria, British rock, and the first wave of first generation Bay Area bands whose members were all just a few years older than him: Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother & the Holding Company, Grateful Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service.\n\nThe Santana Blues Band was formed in 1966, its name owed to some fine print in the San Francisco musicians union contract that one person be named the leader, though everyone thought of it as a collective.  The band\u2019s heady concoction of West Coast soul, Latin percussion, groovy organ, and Carlos\u2019 stratospheric lead guitar was an immediate sensation.   By 1967, they were known simply as Santana.  \n\nThey eventually came to the attention of Graham, who booked them for the first time in October at the Fillmore West on a bill with The Who, in their first appearance at the hall.  As an opening act over the course of the next year, Santana gained a reputation for captivating and winning audiences \u2013 some would say stealing the show \u2013 no matter who the headliner was.  At Graham\u2019s personal request, Clive Davis flew out to San Francisco over Christmas week 1968, witnessed the Santana experience first hand, and signed the band to Columbia Records.\n\nThe band\u2019s first Columbia recording sessions took place in January 1969.  After a lineup shift, new sessions took place in May for what became the landmark Santana debut album.  The LP release was aptly scheduled \u2013 for Monday, August 18, 1969, following their historic Saturday afternoon performance at the Woodstock Music & Art Fair (the only major act to play the festival before their debut album had been released). When Top 40 radio discovered \u201cEvil Ways\u201d in early 1970, the album jumped to #4, on its way to double-platinum and the #150 spot on Rolling Stone magazine\u2019s 500 Greatest Albums list.\n\nThe debut\u2019s success was eclipsed at the end of 1970, when \u201cOye Como Va\u201d and \u201cBlack Magic Woman\u201d sent Abraxas to #1 for 6 weeks; the Grammy Hall Of Fame album has sold more than 5 million copies to date in the U.S. alone.  With \u201cEverybody\u2019s Every\u00acthing\u201d and \u201cNo One To Depend On\u201d again reaching the Top 40, 1971\u2019s Santana III spent 5 weeks at #1 and brought a third consecutive multi-platinum award.\n\nIn many ways, the band\u2019s career is bookended by Santana, Abraxas and Santana III on one end of the timeline and \u2013 three decades later \u2013 Supernatural, Shaman and All That I Am, and now Guitar Heaven\u2026 at the other end of the timeline.  The myriad adventures in between have been chronicled in more books than there are original studio and live albums in the official Santana catalogue (more than 35 titles to date on the Columbia, Columbia\/Legacy, Polydor, and Arista labels).\n\nIn October 2007, Ultimate Santana was released, the most recent anthology \u2013 and the first to include touchstone tracks from the band\u2019s early years on Columbia Records alongside the groundbreaking collaborations that highlight the Arista years.  To date, it is the only place to find \u201cEvil Ways,\u201d \u201cOye Como Va,\u201d \u201cBlack Magic Woman,\u201d \u201cSamba Pa Ti,\u201d \u201cEverybody\u2019s Everything,\u201d and \u201cNo One To Depend On\u201d \u2013 and \u201cSmooth,\u201d \u201cMaria Maria,\u201d \u201cPut Your Lights On,\u201d \u201cCorazon Espinado,\u201d \u201cThe Game of Love,\u201d and \u201cJust Feel Better\u201d (plus other selections) in one package.  Two years later in 2009, the Supernatural: Legacy Edition double-CD was issued, featuring a newly remastered version of the album (for the first time in ten years), plus a second CD of outtakes, remixes and unreleased material from the original recording sessions.\n\nThe arc of Santana\u2019s performing and recording career is complemented by a lifelong devotion to social activism and humanitarian causes.  The Milagro Foundation was launched in 1998, the culmination of decades of support for countless charities and non-profit agencies the world over.  With more than $4 million in grants to date, Milagro supports organizations promoting the welfare of underserved children in the areas of health, education, and the arts. \n\nCarlos also become deeply involved in the fight against the AIDS pandemic in South Africa, through a partnership with ANSA \u2013 Artists for New South Africa.  In fact, all of the proceeds from Santana's 2003 American tour were donated to the cause.  Other organizations championed by Santana include Hispanic Education and Media Group, Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children, Childreach, Rainforest Action Network, Greenpeace, American Indian College Fund, Amnesty International, and the Los Angeles-based Museum of Tolerance. \n\nCarlos' influence and idealism is also felt in the groundbreaking project Architects of a New Dawn (www.aoand.com), a multi-platform media enterprise and social network designed to empower like-minded people from all walks of life to create positive change in the global community.  The project grew out of a vision Carlos has to engage his worldwide audience with extraordinary music, progressive media content and transformational ideas.  AOND is architecting a new reality for the planet based on inspiration, creativity, love and forgiveness.\n\nAfter more than 40 years on the world stage, Carlos Santana is at the pinnacle of his career, more vital and relevant \u2013 and more exposed on radio, TV and the Internet \u2013 than ever before.  His passionate \u201cold school\u201d virtuosity and \u201cnew school\u201d cool attract the hippest artists to every new recording project that he and Clive Davis initiate. At the essence is a signature sound that is unique and instantly identifiable.  With his lifetime of achievement and dedication to music, every move that Santana makes is a multi-cultural event \u2013 the soundtrack for the world.\n\nIn May 2009, Santana became the first act to hold a residency at the spectacular, newly-expanded Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.  Supernatural Santana: A Trip Through The Hits is a musical retrospective running for 72 performances over 2009-2010.  (In August 2010, a special GUITAR HEAVEN\u2026 launch event took place at The Joint, bringing together many of the album\u2019s participants including India.Arie, Gavin Rossdale, and  Chris Daughtry for a live concert event.) \n\nThe idea of a residency in Las Vegas represents a sea change for Carlos, who is on a personal campaign over the last two or three years, \u201cto do everything that I said I would never do.  So this year, I am committed to learn how to cook bouillabaisse, snorkel, and body surf.  My whole life is entering a place with no fear.  Replace fear with possibilities and opportunities.  GUITAR HEAVEN\u2026, when people listen to it, they will be transported into a place beyond what they knew, and to a new place where even my brothers and friends like Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Jeff Beck will celebrate, that we are honoring them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel really happy,\u201d Carlos concludes, \u201cI am more happy than I have ever been in my life because I am grateful.  I am grateful for Clive, I am grateful for Michael Lang and Bill Graham and people who opened doors.  Woodstock was a door, Supernatural was a door.  Everyone who I ever met, Miles Davis or Tito Puente or B.B. King, all of them have gone out of their way to help me keep going.  I have some great teachers, and some of them are my students too.  We hope to touch many, many people\u2019s hearts with GUITAR HEAVEN\u2026  It\u2019s like Olivia said, our goal is to make people jump with joy and cry at the same time.\u201d\n\n(September 2010)","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Rock","hometown":"Autl\u00e1n de Navarro, Jalisco, Mexico","is_published":true,"talking_about_count":45103,"username":"carlossantana","website":"http:\/\/www.santana.com\/ http:\/\/www.santanafanclub.com\/","were_here_count":0,"id":"9411551358","name":"Carlos Santana","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/carlossantana","likes":5269799,"cover":{"cover_id":"10150662931081359","source":"http:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash2\/305591_10150662931081359_25111073_n.jpg","offset_y":14,"offset_x":0}}

{"band_members":"Welcome to the official Brad Paisley Facebook Page","bio":"A rock provides a major clue to the heartbeat of Brad Paisley\u2019s Wheelhouse.\n\n\tThe piece, a silhouette of Paisley\u2019s homestate West Virginia, is embedded in one of two stone walls of the drum room in his converted home studio. The state represents the place where he first acquired the skills that coalesced into one of contemporary country\u2019s most important careers. The studio itself is where he essentially started over, producing himself for the first time and figuratively rebooting a career that was already the envy of most of Paisley\u2019s peers.\n\n\tThe rock reminder of West Virginia definitely belongs on the Middle Tennessee property. Paisley can\u2019t escape his past \u2013 nor would he want to. The 21 #1s, the three awards from ASCAP as the Country Songwriter\/Artist of the Year, the 14 Country Music Association awards (including a win as Entertainer of the Year) and the 14 Academy of Country Music awards provide evidence that he has figured out how to connect in a big way with both the public and the country music business.\n\n\tBut as much as his past informs who he is, Paisley was inspired in this album to take a flying leap off a creative cliff. The album is called Wheelhouse, in part, because of the first line in the first song, \u201cSouthern Comfort Zone.\u201d The studio is now christened the Wheelhouse because Paisley changed his own comfort zone while recording the album.\n\n\t \u201cWhatever we do here,\u201d Paisley says in the studio\u2019s piano room, \u201cwhatever ends up coming out of here on an album, must end up eventually being in my wheelhouse. Because I\u2019ve done it.\u201d  \n\n\tMuch of what ended up among the 17 tracks on Wheelhouse was a result of Paisley\u2019s dedication to challenge. He\u2019d never been his own producer, never commissioned a studio, never recorded an album without falling back on some of Nashville\u2019s studio musicians and never tackled some of the difficult themes that are present in the album. Certainly not in the way that he approached them on Wheelhouse.\n\n\t\u201cEvery song was meant to incorporate something new for me, and to take some sort of twist you don\u2019t expect,\u201d Paisley explains. \u201cWhether that be the lyric or the loop or the guest, or a different format like rap, or getting a comedian like Eric Idle, it needed to spin your head around somewhere.\n\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s like my dog when you say his name followed by a command he doesn\u2019t understand. He\u2019s like, \u201cHuh?\u201d And he turns his head a little sideways. That\u2019s what I wanted every song to do, in one way or another.\u201d\n\n\tPaisley did that in a big way with the album\u2019s first song and lead single, \u201cSouthern Comfort Zone,\u201d which incorporated a bevy of unpredictable elements \u2013 the voice of his late friend, Andy Griffith; pieces of the Southern folk standard \u201cDixieland\u201d; and the Brentwood Baptist Church Choir. All of that was paired with Paisley\u2019s familiar voice and stunning guitar shredding while he challenged listeners to get out of their own comfort zones by seeing as much of the world as possible.\n\n\tEmbracing the song was not a challenge. \u201cSouthern Comfort Zone\u201d became just his latest #1 single even while Paisley continued an 11-month sojourn with the album, which he wrapped in January 2013, just weeks before it was due to ship.\n\n\t\u201cI wrote a bunch of songs that aren\u2019t comfortable,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that was the point, really \u2013 for them to be vocally, musically, lyrically, thematically uncomfortable \u2013 or at least new enough to me that I think I had to stretch.\u201d\n\n\tHe did that in the songwriting process, writing to a pre-existing loop for the first time when he penned \u201cBeat That Summer,\u201d the album\u2019s second single, with frequent collaborator Chris DuBois (\u201cWelcome To The Future,\u201d \u201cOld Alabama\u201d) and in-demand songwriter Luke Laird (\u201cPontoon,\u201d \u201cUndo It\u201d). Paisley took another fresh approach in sampling a classic country song, incorporating Roger Miller\u2019s \u201cDang Me\u201d in \u201cOutstanding In Our Field.\u201d And Paisley challenged himself yet again by threading Monty Python icon Eric Idle into the tongue-in-cheek marital commentary of \u201cHarvey Bodine,\u201d the story of a henpecked husband who finds new life by dying.\n\n\tYou want more challenges? How about incorporating rap for the first time with the recitations of AAA singer\/songwriter Mat Kearney, Grand Ole Opry member Charlie Daniels and iconic rapper LL Cool J?\n\n\tBut the biggest challenges might have come in Paisley\u2019s songwriting. The wit and thoughtfulness that have always been part of his work continue in Wheelhouse, but he pushes them to new extremes. The humor is particularly evident in \u201cDeath Of A Single Man\u201d and the twisted \u201cKarate,\u201d which manages to lighten two very heavy topics: domestic violence and karma. Even more challenging is Paisley\u2019s willingness to explore religious contradiction in \u201cThose Crazy Christians\u201d and the tragedy of discrimination in \u201cAccidental Racist.\u201d \n\n\tThat song went through several incarnations before it finally found its properly sensitive voice. Paisley enlisted LL Cool J to write and deliver the song\u2019s counterpoint, sealing the deal as both of them stood on the stage of Nashville\u2019s historic Ryman Auditorium, gazing at the balcony, ironically named the Confederate Gallery.\n\n\t\u201c\u2018Accidental Racist\u2019 needed to be collaborative because I have no authority in terms of the other perspective,\u201d Paisley says. \u201cI can only speak as a white Southerner. One of the greatest moments of my songwriting life was taking him for a ride around town after touring the Ryman. I\u2019m playing the song, and he\u2019s banging on the dashboard and saying, \u2018This is important. I\u2019m in.\u2019 Then he wrote his entire part himself. And I told him, \u2018You can say whatever you want. You want to tell me I\u2019m crazy? Tell me I\u2019m crazy. There\u2019s nothing off limits for you. Whatever you want to say in this song, you say it.\u2019 And he did.\u201d\n\n\tIt is the single most uncomfortable topic on the album. And it\u2019s exactly why Paisley was adamant that it belonged on Wheelhouse.\n\n\t\u201cWhat kind of an artist am I if I let the fear of consequences for art be take away my willingness to speak about what I believe in?\u201d he asks rhetorically. \u201cI couldn\u2019t look myself in the eye in the mirror if I was willing to just say, \u2018I think it\u2019s important and people need to hear it, but that scares me because I don\u2019t know what that\u2019ll do to my career, so I just won\u2019t put it on there.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\n\tThe Wheelhouse, the site for all of Paisley\u2019s self-challenge, was borne of his personal past. The studio was built in the home he and his wife, actress Kimberly Williams-Paisley, occupied for several years at the beginning of their marriage. Once they built a new place, it became a guest house, but Paisley began to envision it as more of a creative space. His old bedroom had odd angles in its ceiling and closets that created perfect acoustics for a studio environment. He turned the living room into an expansive location for the piano, and used a tiled downstairs bathroom as an echo chamber. He built the drum room \u2013 with its rock walls and dynamic sound \u2013 in just a couple weeks before recording commenced in the spring of 2012.\n\n\tPaisley employed his road band as his studio ensemble, a rare move in mainstream country, and they typically worked after dark on the project, sometimes finishing a session at 4:30 or 5 a.m., just in time to catch the tour bus for a ride to a concert date.\n\n\tPart of the challenge of Wheelhouse was to embrace the humanity of the musicians. Technology was embraced for capturing sound or enhancing it. But it was limited if the intent was to slice every imperfection out of the recordings. \n\n\t\u201cWe didn\u2019t fix much on this whole album,\u201d Paisley notes. \u201cWhen you hear the band, it\u2019s essentially them playing the best they can, it\u2019s not an engineer fixing anything. That was my rule. We could fix something if there was something glaringly bad, but as far as fixes for the sake of perfection or whatever, they are not there. We didn\u2019t do any of that.\u201d  \n\n\tNor did Paisley do that with his vocals. Recording on his own property gave him the freedom to write and re-write new lyrics to his songs at the last minute, and to do his vocal tracks on days when he was particularly inspired. Some of the songs represent him singing a line for the very first time. \n\nBecause he took a leap in producing, he was forced to take even greater command as a singer. Over time, the process increased his confidence and his strength as a vocalist, evident in the elongated notes in \u201cI Can\u2019t Change The World\u201d and \u201cOfficially Alive,\u201d and in the expressiveness of \u201cTin Can On A String,\u201d sung in a vocal booth that was formerly his closet. \n\n\t\u201cIt was a different feeling,\u201d Paisley says of the process. \u201cWhen I hadn\u2019t produced my records, I always really leaned on Frank Rogers to get things out of me. It\u2019s almost like he would have to crack a whip and make me sing.  But when you\u2019re doing it yourself, for me, I had so much to prove and say, it was really up to me to step up to the plate.\u201d\n\n\tPaisley challenged himself in one other important way. The sampled sound of a human heartbeat is introduced in \u201cTin Can,\u201d the 11th of the 17 tracks, and it continues pulsing underneath the remainder of Wheelhouse through the end of the finale, \u201cOfficially Alive,\u201d which Paisley wrote on his own as a summation. \n\n\tAs he experienced a creative rebirth on Wheelhouse, he began to ponder: When does one truly start living? He realized one experiences life most in the midst of personal challenge. \n\u201cYou\u2019re alive when that girl you thought you\u2019d marry is driving away in the limousine with someone else,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re alive when you\u2019re standing in Paris looking at the Eiffel Tower, and you know when you go back to Nashville, you\u2019ll never be the same. And you\u2019re alive when you stand up for something you believe in and aren\u2019t afraid to do that. And you\u2019re alive when your first child is born, and that love you feel is so much larger than you ever imagined possible. That\u2019s why I wrote that. That song was meant to be the exclamation point.\u201d\n\n\tIt\u2019s the final piece of his transition as Paisley moves into the next phase of his career. He cannot \u2013 and will not \u2013 let go of his past. But he\u2019s also excited about the uncertainty of the future. The West Virginia stone is a reminder of where he\u2019s been. The Wheelhouse and its namesake album are the starting point for the rest of Brad Paisley\u2019s creative journey.\t","category":"Musician\/band","genre":"Country","hometown":"Glen Dale, WV","is_published":true,"record_label":"Arista Nashville","talking_about_count":82258,"username":"bradpaisley","website":"http:\/\/www.bradpaisley.com http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/bradpaisley","were_here_count":0,"id":"6791933097","name":"Brad Paisley","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/bradpaisley","likes":6113907,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151894514338098","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/s720x720\/936570_10151894514338098_242306028_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}

{"category":"Musician\/band","description":"Antonio Lucio Vivaldi, nicknamed because of his red hair, was an Italian Baroque composer, Catholic priest, and virtuoso violinist, born in Venice. Recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, his influence during his lifetime was widespread over Europe. Vivaldi is known mainly for composing instrumental concertos, especially for the violin, as well as sacred choral works and over forty operas. His best known work is a series of violin concertos known as The Four Seasons.Many of his compositions were written for the female music ensemble of the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0, a home for abandoned children where Vivaldi had been employed from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740. Vivaldi also had some success with stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for preferment. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival and Vivaldi himself died less than a year later.Though Vivaldi's music was well received during his lifetime, it later declined in popularity until its vigorous revival in the first half of the 20th century. Today, Vivaldi ranks among the most popular and widely recorded of Baroque composers.","is_community_page":true,"is_published":true,"talking_about_count":3633,"website":"http:\/\/www.abc.net.au\/rn\/airplay\/stories\/2011\/3244574.htm","were_here_count":0,"id":"114963478516004","name":"Vivaldi","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Vivaldi\/114963478516004","likes":1084068}

{"about":"Fleetwood Mac LIVE 2013 tour dates: http:\/\/www.fleetwoodmac.com","band_members":"Stevie Nicks, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Lindsey Buckingham","bio":"The Fleetwood Mac story is an episodic saga that spans more than 30 years. It is the saga of a British blues band formed in 1967 that became a California-based pop group in the mid-Seventies. In between came a period where Fleetwood Mac shuffled personnel and experimented with styles, all the while releasing solid albums that found a loyal core audience. Despite all the changes, two members have remained constant over the years: drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie, whose surnames provided the group name Fleetwood Mac. Though most rock fans are familiar with the lineup that includes Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks-by far the longest-running edition of the band, responsible for the classic albums Fleetwood Mac and Rumours-the group possesses a rich and storied history that predates those epics. Earlier Fleetwood Mac lineups included guitarists Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer, Danny Kirwan and Bob Welch. Fleetwood Mac when Green, Fleetwood and McVie, who were all expatriates from British bandleader John Mayall\u2019s Bluesbreakers, decided to form a band. McVie and Fleetwood had been playing with Mayall, a British blues legend, since 1963 and 1965, respectively, while Green replaced Eric Clapton (who exited to form Cream) in 1966. Initially a quartet, the original Fleetwood Mac also included guitarist Jeremy Spencer and then expanded with the addition of Danny Kirwan prior to their second album. Not surprisingly, the group\u2019s first two U.K. albums-Fleetwood Mac (1967) and Mr. Wonderful (1967)-were heavily blues-oriented. \u201cBlack Magic Woman,\u201d a Peter Green song from the latter album, later became a major hit for Santana. In 1969, Fleetwood Mac recorded at Chess studios with American blues musicians, including Willie Dixon and Otis Span; it was released as the two-volume Blues Jam in the U.K. and as Fleetwood Mac in Chicago in the U.S. By decade\u2019s end, however, Fleetwood Mac had begun moving from traditional blues to a more progressive approach. Around this time, the group adopted its distinctive \u201cpenguin\u201d logo, based on zoo-lover and amateur photographer McVie\u2019s interest in the birds. There are arguably three \u201cdefinitive\u201d Fleetwood Mac lineups. One of them is the blues-oriented band of the late Sixties, which arrayed three guitarists (Green, Spencer and Kirwan) around the rhythm section of Fleetwood and McVie. They are best represented by 1969\u2019s Then Play On, a milestone in progressive blues-rock. After Green\u2019s exodus in mid-1970, the remaining members cut the more easygoing, rock and roll-oriented Kiln House. Early in 1971, a born-again Spencer abruptly left the band during a U.S. tour to join the Children of God. The second key configuration found Fleetwood, McVie and Kirwan joined by keyboardist Christine McVie (born Christine Perfect, she\u2019d married bassist McVie) and guitarist Bob Welch, a Southern Californian who became the group\u2019s first American member and a harbinger of new directions. This configuration produced a pair of ethereal pop masterpieces, Future Games (1971) and Bare Trees (1972). Kirwan, who was having personal problems, was asked to leave in August 1972. The remaining foursome, joined by new recruits Dave Walker (vocals) and Bob Weston, recorded Penguin (1973); sans Walker, they cut Mystery to Me (1974). Again reduced to a quartet with Weston\u2019s departure, they released Heroes Are Hard to Find later that same year. Finally, the platinum edition of Fleetwood Mac came together in 1975 with the recruitment of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. The San Francisco duo had previously cut an album together as Buckingham-Nicks. Drummer Fleetwood heard a tape of theirs at a studio he was auditioning, and the pair were drafted into the group without so much as a formal audition. This lineup proved far and away to be Fleetwood Mac\u2019s most durable and successful. In addition to the most solid rhythm section in rock, this classic lineup contained strong vocalists and songwriters in Buckingham, Nicks and Christine McVie. Male and female points of view were offered with unusual candor on the watershed albums Fleetwood Mac (1975) and Rumours (1977). Fleetwood Mac introduced the revitalized group with such sparkling tracks as \u201cOver My Head,\u201d Fleetwood Mac\u2019s first-ever Top Forty single; \u201cRhiannon,\u201d which became Nicks\u2019 signature song; \u201cSay You Love Me,\u201d which showed of the group\u2019s three-part harmonies; and \u201cMonday Morning,\u201d the driving album opener and FM-radio favorite. Rumours was written and recorded as three long-term relationships-between Buckingham and Nicks, the married McVies, and Fleetwood and his wife-publicly unraveled. The album is a virtual document of romantic turmoil, and its timing reflected the interpersonal upheavals of the liberated Seventies. Resonating with a mass audience like no other album in rock history, Rumours yielded a bumper crop of songs with enduring appeal, among them the Top Ten hits \u201cGo Your Own Way,\u201d \u201cDreams,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Stop\u201d and \u201cYou Make Loving Fun.\u201d Fleetwood Mac toured for seven months behind Rumours and reigned as the most popular group in the world. Rumours has to date sold 18 million copies, making it the fifth best-selling album of all time. As a group, Fleetwood Mac has sold more than 70 million albums since its inception in 1967. Under the creative guidance of Lindsey Buckingham, whose skill as a producer and pop visionary became increasingly evident-Fleetwood Mac grew more emboldened with the double album Tusk, released in 1979. A more experimental album, Tusk didn\u2019t match its predecessors sales, but it did earn two more Top Ten hits-\"Sara\" and \u201cTusk\"-while extending the group\u2019s longevity by forswearing formulas. Solo careers commenced during the three-year layoff that followed another extensive tour. Stevie Nicks, in particular, nurtured a career that rivaled Fleetwood Mac\u2019s for popularity. Fleetwood Mac released two studio albums in the Eighties-Mirage (1982) and Tango in the Night (1987)-but its front-line members were increasingly drawn to their solo careers. Disinclined to tour, Buckingham announced he was leaving Fleetwood Mac shortly after Tango in the Night. He was replaced by guitarists Billy Burnette and Rick Vito, who appeared on the 1990 album Behind the Mask. Eventually, both Nicks and Christine McVie revealed they, too, would no longer tour with Fleetwood Mac. Nicks officially left the band a month after Fleetwood Mac regrouped to perform \u201cDon\u2019t Stop\u201d at President Bill Clinton\u2019s inauguration in January 1993. The indefatigable core of Fleetwood and the McVies recruited guitarist Dave Mason and singer Bekka Bramlett, but the proverbial link in Fleetwood Mac\u2019s chain had been broken one too many times and this lineup\u2019s one album, Time (1995), fared poorly. Then, in 1997, Fleetwood Mac\u2019s classic lineup set aside their differences for a reunion that marked the 30th anniversary of the original group\u2019s founding and the 20th anniversary of Rumours\u2019 release. A concert was filmed for an MTV special and saw release on video and audio formats as The Dance, which found the group revisiting old material and premiering new songs. A full-fledged reunion tour followed.

{"about":"Sign up at http:\/\/sarahmclachlan.com for pre-sale and advanced ticket alerts. New Album in the works!!","band_members":"Sarah McLachlan","bio":"On June 15, 2010, the Grammy Award\u2013winning singer and songwriter Sarah McLachlan released of Laws of Illusion. This was Sarah\u2019s first studio album of new material in seven years, since the double\u2013platinum Afterglow in 2003, and its twelve songs rank with the most compelling work ever cre\u00acated by this gifted artist.\n\nIn the years between these two releases, Sarah has married, separated, and is raising two young daughters. These crucial life experiences have en\u00acriched her artistry and infused her new songs with the full range and complexity of adult emotions. In listening to Laws of Illusion, we can hear the strength of hard\u2013earned independence; the trials of love won, lost, and found anew; and the infinite joys of living. \n\nBecause Sarah\u2019s voice is so intimately familiar to so many of us, the experience of Laws of Illusion is a singular and special one. It\u2019s like meeting an old friend again after long separation \u2013 and discovering that the passage of time and the accumulation of experience have only deepened rather than diminished that friendship. \n\nFor Sarah herself, this period was a time of profound change and renewed discovery. \u201cI think when you go into a dark place for a while and you come out of it, the lightness you feel is\u2026euphoric,\u201d she told an Advocate.com interviewer in May 2010. \n\n\u201cMy marriage collapsed a couple of years ago, and it was a long, dark road\u2026Finally coming through that knowing that life is going to be okay, life will go on, and that there\u2019s actually a possibility of love happening again is\u2026just deliriously heady stuff.\u201d\n\nIn Laws of Illusion, Sarah looks at love \u201cfrom both sides now.\u201d The opening track, \u201cAwakenings,\u201d moves on a subdued electronic pulse underpinning ethereal guitar lines and \u2013 as the singer soars into her upper register \u2013 demonstrates her ability to craft an unforgettable \u201chook\u201d without hitting the listener over the head with it.\n\n\u201cLoving You Is Easy,\u201d the first single from the album, is an upbeat, almost jaunty piano\u2013based song, with a musical atmosphere perfectly matched to lyrics that describe the heady thrill of new love: \u201cI\u2019m alive and I\u2019m on fire\/Shot like a starburst into the sky\u2026\u201d\n\nFor many listeners, \u201cForgiveness\u201d will be the centerpiece of Laws of Illusion. There is a wonderful subtlety in the arrangement, which builds inexorably from unaccompanied vocal\u2013and\u2013piano showcase to the layers of near\u2013ambient guitar parts and finally a powerful coda completed by bass and drums. \u201cForgiveness,\u201d says Sarah, \u201cis about the loss of a relationship and drawing a line in the sand, saying: This is not good for me and I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d \n\nThrough the years, we had it all\nThe midnight whispers, the midday calls\nThis house of cards, it had to fall\nYou ask for forgiveness but you\u2019re asking too much\n\u2019Cos I\u2019ve sheltered my heart in a place you can\u2019t touch...\n\nLaws of Illusion is produced by Sarah\u2019s long-time creative collaborator Pierre Marchand, and together they co\u2013wrote a number of the compositions. The sole outside number, \u201cBring On The Wonder,\u201d was written by English singer\/songwriter Susan Enan. (In 2008, Sarah was featured on Susan\u2019s recording of this song for the television soundtrack Bones.)\n\n\u201cPierre and I have worked together for over twenty years,\u201d says Sarah with a trace of awe. \u201cI co-wrote a lot with him on this record, more so than in the past.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an intimate thing to write [songs] with somebody, to reveal oneself like that. But I feel in\u00accredibly comfortable with him \u2013 there are no judgments. Pierre really contributed a lot to the lyrics of some of these songs. He could come up with just the right choice of words \u2013 simple but meaningful \u2013 to fit the story we were trying to tell.\u201d\n\nSarah and Pierre worked quickly and efficiently at their respective home studios in Vancouver and Montreal, cutting all the basic tracks for six songs in just five days. \u201cWe were able to record \u2018live on the floor,\u2019 with myself and the musicians all right there in the room,\u201d Sarah explains. \u201cIt was quick and exciting, and really a first for me to work that way.\u201d \n\nIn addition to some familiar names from past McLachlan sessions, the supporting cast for Laws of Illusion includes the much\u2013traveled drummer Matt Chamberlain, who\u2019s played with everyone from Pearl Jam to John Mayer; and guitarist Colin Cripps, best known for his work with Canadian singer\/songwriter Kathleen Edwards. Laws of Illusion will be available both as a standard 12\u2013track compact disc and in a deluxe version including a five\u2013song bonus DVD of live in-studio performances.\n","booking_agent":"The Feldman Agency","category":"Musician\/band","current_location":"Vancouver, Canada","general_manager":"The Feldman Agency","genre":"Pop","hometown":"Halifax, Nova Scotia","is_published":true,"press_contact":"Cindy Pond, Taylor & Pond","record_label":"Verve Music","talking_about_count":46346,"username":"sarahmclachlan","website":"http:\/\/www.sarahmclachlan.com http:\/\/twitter.com\/sarahmclachlan\/ http:\/\/www.myspace.com\/sarahmclachlan ","were_here_count":0,"id":"9272006351","name":"Sarah McLachlan","link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/sarahmclachlan","likes":1294980,"cover":{"cover_id":"10151896799246352","source":"http:\/\/scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/s720x720\/1185162_10151896799246352_2006382233_n.jpg","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0}}
